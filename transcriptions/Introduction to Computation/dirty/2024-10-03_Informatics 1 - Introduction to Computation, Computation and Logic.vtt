WEBVTT

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 0>First question is, can you hear me through this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 0>So last time last week, we talked about syllogisms and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 0>checking that syllogisms are valid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 0>And we looked at three forms of reasoning that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 0>can use to get from one sequence sequent from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 0>categorical statement to another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 0>We had the rule of double negation, which says that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 0>if you know that A is true, then you know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 0>that not not A is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 0>And the other way round, we had our fundamental syllogism,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 0>Barbara, which says that if A entails B and b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 0>entails C, then A entails C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 0>And I think early on we agreed that that was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 0>a pretty obvious piece of sound reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 0>And then towards the end we talked about composition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69]}

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 0>If you know that A entails B, then you know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 0>that not B entails not A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 0>So this is the basis of proof by contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 0>This works both ways round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73]}

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 0>So if you know this, you know that if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 0>know this, you know that well, you put up a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,81,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 0>few diagrams to illustrate it at the end, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 0>can just look at it by a simple reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 0>Any questions about what we looked at last week?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 0>Or absorbed it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 0>So what we're going to do this week is go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 0>on and look at the other syllogisms that Aristotle came

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 0>up with, some of which we agree with as modern

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 0>people and some of which we don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 0>And so we'll discuss that at the end of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 0>week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 0>And then we will also talk a bit more about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 0>negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 0>So towards the end of last time, I talked a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 0>little bit about this syllogism involving all snakes or reptiles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100]}

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 0>No reptile has fur, so no snake has fur.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 0>And we said that this looks just like Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 0>It has not C instead of C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 0>So from our point of view where a negated proposition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 0>is negated, predicate is just another predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 0>It's Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100]}

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 0>Aristotle didn't see things that name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 0>So that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 0>So it had another name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 0>So at the moment we have these reasonings and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 0>idea that a negated predicate is just a predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 0>What happens if we take Barbara and splash negation symbols

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 0>everywhere?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 0>So here's Barbara itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 0>Here's what we get by using not a instead of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 0>a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 0>Here's what we get by using not C instead of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 0>C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 0>That's what we saw before Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.780
<v Speaker 0>I'm using not A instead of A and not C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 0>instead of C, and so on and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 0>So just by exchanging C for not C, a for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 0>not a and b for not b, we have eight

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 0>different syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.430
<v Speaker 0>From our point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 0>These are all the same because they all have the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 0>same shape as Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.019
<v Speaker 0>But for Aristotle, these would all have been different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, some of them wouldn't even count as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms at all for Aristotle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 0>So let's think about it from our point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.410
<v Speaker 0>Do you agree that these are all basically Barbara or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 0>we've done is change?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80]}

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.210
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.820
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 0>Anybody not agree?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 0>Anybody think there might be something dodgy about this idea

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.800
<v Speaker 0>that we can just change a predicate?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's about 98% not committed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 0>I'll assume that you will be committed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 0>So our principal of Barbara said, we have A, B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 0>and C, and you can plug anything at all in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 0>place of A and anything in place of B and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 0>anything in place of C, and it still makes sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 0>Now if we go back to Aristotle's time, he didn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 0>have a modern view of negation, as I've said before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 0>So he didn't actually think about the idea that not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 0>A was a predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 0>Just like A is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 0>He did think about things like A entails, not B,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 0>but he expressed it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 0>But he saw that as what he called a negative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 0>statement about the positive predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 0>He didn't see it as A entails, not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.050
<v Speaker 0>He said it saw it as nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.610
<v Speaker 0>That is, A is B, and you should think a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,78,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 0>better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.940
<v Speaker 0>Make sure that those two things mean the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.040
<v Speaker 0>So if we look at the eight possibilities here and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 0>take out the ones that involve negations on the left

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 0>of predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.650
<v Speaker 0>So here he didn't think about making statements like all

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.460
<v Speaker 0>not Greeks, um, mortal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100]}

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, I mean, he could have said such a thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,65,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.180
<v Speaker 0>He would have said all barbarians immortal, but he didn't

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.890
<v Speaker 0>express it as not Greeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Speaker 0>So if you go back and look at a classic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.620
<v Speaker 0>pre-modern textbook with these eight syllogisms, you won't see any

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.140
<v Speaker 0>of the ones that mention a negated predicate on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 0>So if we get rid of them, that only leaves

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 0>the two predicates we've seen already, which in the Middle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,96,19]}

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 0>So that's the the classic one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,98,100,100]}

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.090
<v Speaker 0>And that's the snakes and reptiles form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 0>How many more syllogisms could Aristotle come up with?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.900
<v Speaker 0>Well, Aristotle did have the kind of reasoning that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.670
<v Speaker 0>looked at last time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.190
<v Speaker 0>So he knew about contra position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,97]}

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.630
<v Speaker 0>He didn't have it in quite as cleaner form as

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 0>we have it, but he did have it.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 0>And so if you use contra position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.790
<v Speaker 0>You can get another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Three universal syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 0>So what we've got here is starting from the snake

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 0>and reptile one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100]}

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 0>I've done con for position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,38,69,100]}

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 0>B entails not C contra position is swap and negate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 0>So if I swap swap c and B and negate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.060
<v Speaker 0>them I get C and not be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.130
<v Speaker 0>Here I've done a contra position on A and not

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.020
<v Speaker 0>C swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.190
<v Speaker 0>Negate gives me C and not a, and here I

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.020
<v Speaker 0>have done contra position on both of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 0>So I've negated that and that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.060
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:41.099
<v Speaker 0>That gives me five sound syllogisms about universal statements about

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.169

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.560
<v Speaker 0>And again, if anybody is curious, these were called Cesaro

<v Speaker 0>mayonnaise and chemistries.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[29,100,93]}

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 0>Has anybody gone and looked up the names?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.620
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.330
<v Speaker 0>You're still saying?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.020
<v Speaker 0>It can be shown.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.230
<v Speaker 0>And I think in one of the tutorials we will

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.500
<v Speaker 0>ask you to look at the exercise in the book

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.910
<v Speaker 0>that says show that this is true, that these three,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.260

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.450
<v Speaker 0>universal syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:28.270
<v Speaker 0>That is, statements about syllogisms involving just all statements or

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.530
<v Speaker 0>no statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.390
<v Speaker 0>So this is a no statement.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Speaker 0>No A is C.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 0>the syllogisms about universal statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 0>So we that's our complete reasoning set for categorical statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,81,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 0>We'll go on to see more about these syllogisms in

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 0>a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 0>But first, any questions about what I did here in

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 0>this composition?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 0>We're going to be doing a lot more composition in

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 0>a lot more different ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to be important that you get into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 0>your heads what composition is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,98]}

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it would be a good idea to go through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 0>one of the examples on the board.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 0>Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.280
<v Speaker 0>So here's Laurent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71]}

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 0>Now, first of all, looking at this as a syllogism

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.390
<v Speaker 0>in its own right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.130
<v Speaker 0>Do you believe it as a piece of reasoning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:00.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.670
<v Speaker 0>So if I entails B and B entails not C,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.730
<v Speaker 0>then and it's not C, it's for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,46,100,100,69,100,100]}

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 0>It's just Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.180
<v Speaker 0>But for Aristotle it was different because of the negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.420
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm going to do with the first one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.280
<v Speaker 0>Is you'll see that it differs because I've done something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.960
<v Speaker 0>to the B and the C here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 0>So what have I done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 0>I must not go over there because it won't show

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.160
<v Speaker 0>So try and get that definition into your head.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's how I remember it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.090
<v Speaker 0>Contra position is a fancy Latin word for taking.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.360
<v Speaker 0>If p, then q and turn it into.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.640
<v Speaker 0>If not p, then not q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.150
<v Speaker 0>And that reasoning those two things imply each other is

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.370
<v Speaker 0>what you do when you do a proof by contradiction.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.730
<v Speaker 0>So if I do quantum position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.180
<v Speaker 0>On this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.150
<v Speaker 0>I swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.420
<v Speaker 0>So I put the two things on the other side.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.590
<v Speaker 0>And I negate them by negating b I get not

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 0>b by negating see I get not not see.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 0>And then I use double negation to get to get

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 0>that.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.320

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.810

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't matter whether the premises are true or

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 0>if I plug these diagrams together and do the shading,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.720
<v Speaker 0>And the answer was a universe in which there are

<v Speaker 0>no snakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.950
<v Speaker 0>It should be noted that Aristotle would have disagreed with

<v Speaker 0>us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.070
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come on to why Aristotle disagreed with us.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.770
<v Speaker 0>Again, it's to do with something.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.680
<v Speaker 0>I've already mentioned the existential assumption.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>reasoning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, you don't need to do it graphically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,97,91]}

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.820
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.670
<v Speaker 0>So we do it graphically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 0>Fundamentally, we do it graphically because Michael Forman liked graphical

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.650

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm not really a graphical reasoner, so I do

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 0>it symbolically.

<v Speaker 0>I just say, well, if A entails B and b

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 0>entails not C, and I just kind of think about

<v Speaker 0>Kind of advantage of this is that it steers you

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 0>So we look at the mismatch between this diagram and

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 0>this diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.060

<v Speaker 0>Try.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:01.640
<v Speaker 0>of the obvious categories of rubbish reasoning from a logistic

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 0>So what have we done so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:50.800
<v Speaker 0>We have established five depending on how you count universal

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 0>So that is syllogisms about statements of the form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.720
<v Speaker 0>All A or B or no A is B.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 0>Here they are all listed again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 0>Notice that these come in more or less equivalent forms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.980
<v Speaker 0>If you look at this and this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.190
<v Speaker 0>Then they look different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 0>But they're effectively the same because they're supposed versions of

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 0>each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:23.870
<v Speaker 0>So whether you can't 5 or 7 depends on how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.040
<v Speaker 0>you like to count.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.570
<v Speaker 0>And much of this is Aristotle.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.430
<v Speaker 0>So these are the five syllogisms that Aristotle recognised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.620
<v Speaker 0>And these are variants of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 0>If you look at these, which are all sound, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 0>you will note this observation.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 0>Count how many negations there are in the syllogisms.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 0>And if we look at them, you see everything has

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 0>either no negations or two negations, one in a premise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 0>and one in the conclusion, one in the premise, one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 0>in the conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 0>Same there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 0>Same there and same there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.040
<v Speaker 0>So Barbara is the basic one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,96]}

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.330
<v Speaker 0>It has no negations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.790
<v Speaker 0>Everything else has one negation in the premise and one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.810
<v Speaker 0>in the conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.880
<v Speaker 0>On the other hand, if we go back and look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:37.750
<v Speaker 0>at this unsound syllogism, it has only one negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.850
<v Speaker 0>So it's just got one negation here in the premise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.250
<v Speaker 0>positive and positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.570
<v Speaker 0>This is actually a general rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 0>The sound syllogisms have an even number of negations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.700
<v Speaker 0>The unsound syllogisms have an odd number of negations, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Speaker 0>that's a quick check to see whether a syllogism makes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.230
<v Speaker 0>sense or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 0>So let me summarise what we've done both last week

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 0>and so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.790
<v Speaker 0>We started with our fundamental rule, Barbara, and we applied

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,88,100,100,100]}

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Speaker 0>the two techniques of contra position and double negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,76,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 0>And we got five sound syllogisms plus a couple of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 0>variations about universal statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 0>So all and no statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 0>What is contra position?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 0>Well contra position as I said it's negate and swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 0>So we've done it applied to sequence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.850
<v Speaker 0>So I take a entails B swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 0>Negate gives me not B entails not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.900

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.880
<v Speaker 0>can I conclude?

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.800
<v Speaker 0>you manipulate laws.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.560
<v Speaker 0>If you are actually doing legal reasoning, most of you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.320
<v Speaker 0>probably don't do much legal reasoning right now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.340
<v Speaker 0>But at some point you're going to enter a world

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 0>where you have to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.090
<v Speaker 0>In particular, you're going to have to reason about taxes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.070
<v Speaker 0>and which taxes you have to pay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.900
<v Speaker 0>And tax law is a fascinating subject because it's really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:40.080
<v Speaker 0>quite formally written in documents, many hundreds of pages long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.900
<v Speaker 0>And at some point you do have to start doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.970
<v Speaker 0>this kind of reasoning to work out whether you owe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.960
<v Speaker 0>tax or not, because people who write tax laws are

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.610
<v Speaker 0>extremely fond of things that go like this will applies

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,90]}

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Speaker 0>unless these three things happen and an exception to these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.210
<v Speaker 0>three things happening is and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 0>So the reasoning can be quite subtle and quite expensive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 0>to get wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, and let me pass on to you one piece

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>of advice from my father.

<v Speaker 0>Never, ever annoy Her Majesty's revenue and Customs, because they

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 0>can make your life miserable for so long, in so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.210
<v Speaker 0>many ways that you just don't want to go there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 0>Slightly less miserable than some other countries.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 0>Revenue departments will make it, but still pretty miserable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 0>So let's get back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.060
<v Speaker 0>To a bit of abstraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 0>Well, maybe let's first take questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.840
<v Speaker 0>Any questions about this as a piece of reasoning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.730
<v Speaker 0>So how is it different?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.440
<v Speaker 0>That's a very good question because you've detected, I think,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.899
<v Speaker 0>what it is that makes me a bit unhappy about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:09.899 --> 00:34:15.690
<v Speaker 0>this section of the course, because really we're looking at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.580
<v Speaker 0>kind of propositional statements, aren't we?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:19.980
<v Speaker 0>We're addressing them up to look like rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.240
<v Speaker 0>But if I wrote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.720
<v Speaker 0>I could write them as propositional statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.080
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.669
<v Speaker 0>So it's actually going to become apparent that everything we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:56.070
<v Speaker 0>do is just something that works at many levels.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.010
<v Speaker 0>So this isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 0>Radically different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 0>It's just an example of of composition being used with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 0>a different format of premises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.070
<v Speaker 0>So here I've written Marta's rules in the same way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 0>that we did on the previous slide where I was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 0>negating sequence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.970
<v Speaker 0>So the main point is that composition is very general

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,88,100,100,100]}

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 0>It applies at all levels of reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.730
<v Speaker 0>You can do it on simple propositional statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 0>P implies q is the same as not q implies

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:32.180
<v Speaker 0>p.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 0>You can do it at the level of sequence A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:36.440
<v Speaker 0>entails.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.080
<v Speaker 0>B is the same as not B entails not A,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.420
<v Speaker 0>and you can do it at the level of rules

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:48.260
<v Speaker 0>like this where you have um, p and q and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.270
<v Speaker 0>then r follows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100]}

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.060
<v Speaker 0>Then you can do composition across those as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 0>The other point of course, is that here we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 0>two premises and one conclusion, and I can do quantum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 0>position with the conclusion and one premise at a time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 0>So again, we'll think about that in more detail later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 0>And the full answer to the question will become apparent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 0>in a week or two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 0>Can I do a quantum position on the two premises?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,49,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 0>No, because contra position is about things that are in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 0>an if then relationship.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.540
<v Speaker 0>And this vertical line is serving the purpose of an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 0>if then statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 0>So if I were to do swap and negate on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 0>the two premises, that would amount to negating both the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,84]}

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 0>premises, which is undecided thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,72,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:06.680
<v Speaker 0>So having set up composition as this very useful thing,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,36,38,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 0>let's get back to the more symbolic representation and think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.740
<v Speaker 0>about, um, what we can do with Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, incidentally, how many of you noticed that I'm saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100]}

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.940
<v Speaker 0>contra posing instead of contra posing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:29.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.440
<v Speaker 0>Who thinks I'm being a pretentious idiot by doing so?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.000
<v Speaker 0>Somebody should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.750
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 0>It's a curious thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.200
<v Speaker 0>It's essentially because of the way Latin worked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 0>If you are following Latin etymology, then the verb ought

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.650
<v Speaker 0>to be contra pone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.720
<v Speaker 0>But then in that case we ought to be saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 0>or pone instead of oppose and such like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,86,100,100,73,100,100,92]}

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.670
<v Speaker 0>And for bizarre historical reasons, logicians have sometimes decided to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.000
<v Speaker 0>say contraption instead of contra pose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 0>Maybe because contra pose is something we use as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 0>normal English word to put two things next to each

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 0>other, whereas this is a different use.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 0>So because I quite like Latin and because I am

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.120
<v Speaker 0>a pretentious get some of the time, I'm continuing to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 0>say contraption, but don't feel you have to if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 0>find it obnoxious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:44.460
<v Speaker 0>So if we take Barbara, then we've got the rules

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.310
<v Speaker 0>and tells B, B, and Tlca entail C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,98,82,100,13,97,98]}

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:51.140
<v Speaker 0>Each of these things is something that can be negated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.510
<v Speaker 0>So we can take this rule and do composition on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.930
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:02.630
<v Speaker 0>So we can say instead of negating the sequence of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,65]}

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:06.470
<v Speaker 0>the individual sequent, we swap those about as we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 0>in the Scottish law example on the previous slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.960
<v Speaker 0>Now if I swap and negate to sequence, what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 0>it I'm negating?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.100
<v Speaker 0>I'm not negating the predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.160
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not adding negations there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.570
<v Speaker 0>That's something different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.460
<v Speaker 0>What I'm doing is negating the whole sequence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:41.330
<v Speaker 0>So I'm saying here A does not entail C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,64]}

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Or, to put.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.500
<v Speaker 0>It another way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, a does not entail C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,52]}

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Speaker 0>What does A does not entail C mean it means

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.460
<v Speaker 0>there is a C that is not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Speaker 0>And I can do that on the left or the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:13.860
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.890
<v Speaker 0>So I could take this conclusion and I could contraption

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:21.510
<v Speaker 0>it with that premise to give that or with that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.040
<v Speaker 0>premise to give that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.940
<v Speaker 0>What do these look like?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.320
<v Speaker 0>In terms of diagrams, we have statements like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.470
<v Speaker 0>So this is the every a is BA entails B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,62,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.890
<v Speaker 0>What does A does not entail C mean it means

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:50.150
<v Speaker 0>some a is not See, there is an A, there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.080
<v Speaker 0>is not see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85]}

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.100
<v Speaker 0>So now we've left the the realm of universal statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:01.190
<v Speaker 0>And we're talking about existential statements, things that assert the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Speaker 0>existence of something which we haven't done any reasoning for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.040
<v Speaker 0>so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:11.270
<v Speaker 0>And actually, in much of the time we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:16.280
<v Speaker 0>say that something does exist, something there is something which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.650
<v Speaker 0>is true, which has some nice property.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:30.560
<v Speaker 0>So here are some questions which we can think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 0>I think we can think about them now because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 0>have a few minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 0>So think about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.610
<v Speaker 0>I said I could do contradiction between the conclusion And

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.870
<v Speaker 0>one premise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:50.670
<v Speaker 0>Or I could do it between that conclusion and that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.360
<v Speaker 0>premise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:59.280
<v Speaker 0>What would happen if I did it with both premises?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.500
<v Speaker 0>Would I get something that is sound, or would I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.150
<v Speaker 0>get something that doesn't work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.750
<v Speaker 0>What would the what would it even mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.810
<v Speaker 0>Because I can't swap the premise with both conclusions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:21.510
<v Speaker 0>Maybe related question is I've been cheerfully writing all these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.580
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms with two premises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.410
<v Speaker 0>This one and this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.730
<v Speaker 0>Again, somebody asked on Piazza, unfortunately, in a private question,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.820
<v Speaker 0>I think, does it matter which way round the premises

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.270
<v Speaker 0>are?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:36.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, does it matter which way round I write the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.990
<v Speaker 0>premises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 0>If I wrote B and tail C and tails B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,56,52,100,49,49,98]}

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 0>and tail C, would it matter?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.760
<v Speaker 0>No, I mean they're just premises, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.980
<v Speaker 0>Well, they have the same status.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 0>And again, this is something that is true for us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.140
<v Speaker 0>as modern logicians.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 0>But in the classical presentation these two things were distinguished.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 0>So they would talk about a major premise and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 0>minor premise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 0>And I can never remember which one is which.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 0>So I think that this is the major premise and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 0>this is the minor premise, but I'm not sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.430
<v Speaker 0>And who cares because we have modern logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 0>If we were allowing ourselves more notational freedom and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 0>could combine lots of things with logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.720
<v Speaker 0>What is the symbol that we would write between these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.240
<v Speaker 0>two premises to express their relation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.200
<v Speaker 0>And what we're really saying is, if this is true

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.900
<v Speaker 0>and this is true, then this is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.790
<v Speaker 0>So then I think now we're at a little exercise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:03.870
<v Speaker 0>for next time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.860
<v Speaker 0>Go away and think a little about if I started

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.020
<v Speaker 0>putting ands in here, what would happen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.960
<v Speaker 0>Suppose I could combine these with an and we haven't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,76,93,100,100]}

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.930

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.140
<v Speaker 0>We're going to later week 4 or 5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,99,99]}

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.580
<v Speaker 0>But if we could combine these two sequence by saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.760
<v Speaker 0>A entails B and b entails C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.190
<v Speaker 0>And that was just one premise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 0>What would happen if we then did contra position with

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 0>the conclusion?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.350
<v Speaker 0>So for those of you who are wanting to stretch

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:39.680
<v Speaker 0>a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.550
<v Speaker 0>Think about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.680
<v Speaker 0>See if you can work out what happens next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.160
<v Speaker 0>I've got an awful lot of different ways of writing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:06.290
<v Speaker 0>So back in the propositional logic I had a implies

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.500

<v Speaker 0>am a banana.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:14.300
<v Speaker 0>Statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.530
<v Speaker 0>Propositional logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:21.260
<v Speaker 0>We have been working with A entails B, and remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.050
<v Speaker 0>that this is not a simple propositional statement because it

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.150
<v Speaker 0>has an implicit quantifier in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:30.740
<v Speaker 0>It says for every x a of x implies b

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.340
<v Speaker 0>of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 0>And actually we have yet another form of implication because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 0>we have the form of implication that says if the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.270
<v Speaker 0>premises are true, then the conclusion is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 0>So we've got at least three different kinds of if

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.470
<v Speaker 0>then kicking around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100]}

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.440
<v Speaker 0>So have a bit of a think about what the

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 0>relationship between them is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 0>And I think that's a good point to stop for

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.270

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.850

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.880
<v Speaker 0>Any final questions about today?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.110

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.340
