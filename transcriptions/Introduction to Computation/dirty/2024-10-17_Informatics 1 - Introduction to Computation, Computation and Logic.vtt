00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 0>So as I said a few times, I think it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 0>a time to slow down a little bit, take a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 0>breather, because this is essentially a break between a couple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 0>of sections of the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 0>So this has been about logic and proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to do one more logical thing next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 0>week part of this week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 0>and then after that, we move on to thinking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 0>computation more directly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 0>What we do next will be a kind of bridge

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 0>between them, but we've introduced quite a lot of stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.950
<v Speaker 0>We've introduced logic, um, propositional logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,50,100,100]}

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 0>So logistic logic and we've introduced various ways of proving.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 0>And I haven't been looking at the tutorial marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 0>Overall, I think a lot of people are fairly happy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 0>with everything, but not everybody is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 0>So as I told you, I plan for today to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 0>be basically going back over anything you would like me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 0>to go back over and doing any problems or answering

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 0>any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 0>And the idea is that we do them, not me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, so over to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 0>What would you like me to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 0>So the existential assumption is still worrying some people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.430
<v Speaker 0>How many people are still a bit worried by the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 0>existential assumption?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.230
<v Speaker 0>More and more and more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100]}

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 0>A few um, so I guess there are a couple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 0>of aspects of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 0>Is the UN clarity what it is or why we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 0>talking about it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, in particular, I think maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 0>It's probably easiest if I write on the screen, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.430
<v Speaker 0>then the people online can see more easily, and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550
<v Speaker 0>can also state it around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,42]}

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.640
<v Speaker 0>So one question is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 0>Then what's the the meaning of universal quantification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.650
<v Speaker 0>So universal quantification we expect to mean for all x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,40,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 0>But what is x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Speaker 0>So for us x means all x in some universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 0>I forget what what kind of symbol did I use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 0>for universes right at the start of the course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Was it curly letters?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.680
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.170
<v Speaker 0>Let's use curly letters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 0>That's supposed to be a curly X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we've got some universe, and we make some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.170
<v Speaker 0>statement that for all x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 0>P of x is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.680
<v Speaker 0>And the thing that confuses Fuses many people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 0>And that leads to the difference between us and Aristotle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 0>is whether the empty universe is legitimate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 0>Do we allow the empty universe as a sensible thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 0>to talk about?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.350
<v Speaker 0>So I've been trying to indoctrinate you for five, six

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 0>weeks now, five weeks about the right answer to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.340
<v Speaker 0>But possibly indoctrination isn't the most reasonable way of doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 0>So who is completely happy with the idea that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 0>makes sense to talk about logic in an empty universe?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay, who thinks it's definitely a bit odd?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 0>Only one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 0>So that leaves about 90% of you uncommitted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 0>So what do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 0>Somebody who didn't raise a hand at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.310
<v Speaker 0>What do you think about it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 0>If I had a better memory, I would point at

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.050
<v Speaker 0>one of you, but I don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.140
<v Speaker 0>I suppose this gets back or down to a rather

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.360
<v Speaker 0>fundamental thing about mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.530
<v Speaker 0>So making a decision about whether we should talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.850
<v Speaker 0>empty universes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.420
<v Speaker 0>What kind of decision is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.460
<v Speaker 0>Is it a mathematical decision forced on us by logic?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 0>Is it, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 0>Is it a matter of personal preference?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.210
<v Speaker 0>Is it a matter of sociological preference?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.830
<v Unknown>Yeah, I guess it's so that we can take into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,78,54,96,87,56,100,100,100]}

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Unknown>account Is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67]}

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 0>So?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 0>So we can take into account things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 0>That sounds like a kind of pragmatic reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, so fundamentally, I think what I've been arguing is

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.370

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, so many of you have already programmed in languages

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.940

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.220

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 0>it says it is not the case that A entails,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 0>not a and that seems odd because what does.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 0>A entails not a mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 0>That's clearly nonsense, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 0>Because things can't be both A and not a, but

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.920
<v Speaker 0>what that really means turned into first order logic.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:11.080

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.620
<v Speaker 0>And then we go back up to where we were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 0>before and say if A is false about everything in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:27.220
<v Speaker 0>the universe, then this statement is actually always true because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 0>A is A of x is false for every x,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 0>and therefore the implication because of this weird way implication

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.290
<v Speaker 0>So it is possible for this sequence whole, but it's

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 0>So therefore, if we simply cross it out, we're saying

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.670

<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 0>So and then the the other aspect of the formulation

<v Speaker 0>Remember what we're doing when we write a proof rule

<v Speaker 0>follows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 0>So if we leave the top blank that says what's

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.210

<v Speaker 0>So we've got various sorts of always true going on

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.050
<v Speaker 0>Does that help?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.840

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.150
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm trying to do here is to build

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.630
<v Speaker 0>a proof that the bottom holds.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 0>And somewhere up top I want to use the existential

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.820
<v Speaker 0>assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.230
<v Speaker 0>Which means I would probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Speaker 0>quite like to have the negation on the top.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 0>How could I get the negation to the top?

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 0>Well, actually, you know, maybe I don't want to do

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 0>Whatever I do, there's going to be a negation here.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Speaker 0>So which of these predicates?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.090
<v Speaker 0>I've got three predicates A, b and C, which is

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.360
<v Speaker 0>the one where I'm asserting existence on the bottom.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 0>C c yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,57,99]}

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.190
<v Speaker 0>Agreed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.700
<v Speaker 0>So I'm saying that some c are b because I'm

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.610

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.210
<v Speaker 0>So it's a fairly good bet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.380
<v Speaker 0>That I'm going to need to use that assumption that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 0>Can propose the print.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 0>Which the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100]}

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 0>So if we can propose the second premise and conclusion.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.180
<v Speaker 0>We get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So he.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,42]}

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.240
<v Speaker 0>Then confirms the first premise by itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.150

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Then see is you know so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,71,11,10,10,62]}

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 0>So I say that again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

<v Speaker 1>Let's see.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.940

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.710

<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.390

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Is one element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,78,73]}

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Then, you know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 0>Can we make that a formal up?

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.370

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Speaker 0>Some of you did the exercise in the tutorial, so

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.260
<v Speaker 0>can you apply what you did there to this slightly

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.890
<v Speaker 0>different one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we plug these two together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.290

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.920
<v Speaker 0>That's a much more complicated piece of reasoning than just

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.130

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:20.120
<v Speaker 0>of our sound syllogisms, the 15 of them, you can

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 0>just work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.420
<v Speaker 0>Well, I find it easier to work backwards, but here

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 0>you have to work out how to plug the existential

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.140

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.840
<v Speaker 0>and post the result?

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.240

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.220
<v Speaker 0>means it's more work for me, whereas you're the ones

<v Speaker 0>try anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.590
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.310
<v Speaker 0>So there's the Earth and there's the equator and there's

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.970
<v Speaker 0>the pole.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.010
<v Speaker 0>If you think about this triangle.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.580

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.970
<v Speaker 0>And so Pythagoras doesn't apply on the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 0>And none of the triangle geometry applies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, and of course, those of you who are doing

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.330

<v Speaker 0>the universe is, it is probably not a Euclidean geometry.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 0>Actually, that's not Pythagoras theorem anyways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,100,100,100,81,77]}

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 0>It's you have to get something else to make a

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 0>Pythagorean nonsense out of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:49.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's an issue about what mathematics is, to

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 0>the extent that it's a universal truth and what it

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 0>is to the extent that it's true in the universe

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:02.230
<v Speaker 0>we're working on, and whether logic is a universal truth.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.620
<v Speaker 0>So if you ask a logician.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.810
<v Speaker 0>They will say that logic is a universal truth.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.530
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:14.510
<v Speaker 0>Fundamentally, because we are symbols shuffling what we do when

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.880
<v Speaker 0>we do logic, or if we do group theory, which

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 0>you will be doing if you're doing maths or Newtonian

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.860
<v Speaker 0>dynamics, you set up some assumptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.960
<v Speaker 0>You set up some equations which you think are a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.130
<v Speaker 0>model of the world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:32.150
<v Speaker 0>If it's the world you're modelling and then you prove

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:37.160
<v Speaker 0>some stuff using those equations and definitions, and then it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 0>up to you to validate whether your conclusion actually works

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.910
<v Speaker 0>in the real world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 0>If you're doing applied mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 0>As I said in the very beginning of the lecture,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 0>in logic, we have lots of different forms of logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 0>So we're giving you classical logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 0>But classical logic is not always the right logic to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 0>be talking about a particular real life problem, because you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.610
<v Speaker 0>may be talking about a problem involving people's beliefs involving

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.910
<v Speaker 0>probabilities, where classical logic is simply not a good model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.590
<v Speaker 0>So mathematicians tend to be quite schizophrenic about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, who has heard of the term Platonism?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.400
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.030
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.290
<v Speaker 0>Any advance on two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:20.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.240
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.870
<v Speaker 0>Two and a half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:22.320
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Platonism is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.810
<v Speaker 0>This is a simplification because it's always more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 0>Platonism is a philosophical view point that things are real,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.280
<v Speaker 0>and in particular mathematical objects are real.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 0>So the real numbers exist, complex numbers exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.350
<v Speaker 0>The wavefunction of the electron exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.240
<v Speaker 0>And as I go through those, through through those three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.700
<v Speaker 0>things, you might be more and more sceptical about whether

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 0>they actually exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.910
<v Speaker 0>But I think most working Mathematicians go through their everyday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.430
<v Speaker 0>lives on the basis that we're talking about things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.150
<v Speaker 0>exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.000
<v Speaker 0>On the other hand, it's impossible to come up with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.830

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.830
<v Speaker 0>We can't even come up with a justification for ourselves

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.399
<v Speaker 0>existing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:15.399 --> 00:34:16.929
<v Speaker 0>So how do I know you're there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.370
<v Speaker 0>How do I know I'm here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.800
<v Speaker 0>Could all be in a simulation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 0>I don't believe we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.090
<v Speaker 0>I don't believe those arguments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.850
<v Speaker 0>But that's a matter of faith rather than reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:32.320
<v Speaker 0>And so there's an alternative view which says that mathematics

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.980
<v Speaker 0>is simply symbol shuffling according to derived rules.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.700
<v Speaker 0>We have some symbols, we have rules for transforming symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.129
<v Speaker 0>And what comes out of the end is just what

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:44.919
<v Speaker 0>comes out at the end according to our particular rules.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.560
<v Speaker 0>And this is a very computer science way of thinking

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.409
<v Speaker 0>profound developments in logic.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.120

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 0>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[21]}

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.670
<v Speaker 0>The one where I split the universe in half.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 0>That was the way of the comma, I believe.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 0>I've got an hour.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that was this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm not entirely sure that I would have chosen to

<v Speaker 0>Let me get my red circle up again.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:09.490
<v Speaker 0>The use of these sequence with sets of premises on

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:20.350
<v Speaker 0>So if I'm thinking about a whole bunch of things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.900

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.620
<v Speaker 0>How do I think about that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.230
<v Speaker 0>I mean, we've said that comma means and and the

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.180

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:35.200
<v Speaker 0>So logically speaking, I'm saying everything in and of everything

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.770

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, but that's not the way I tend to be

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.750
<v Speaker 0>thinking about it, because if I'm looking at a particular

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.750
<v Speaker 0>proof when I'm doing one stage in a proof, remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.450
<v Speaker 0>you're looking for a one rule to apply, and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.920
<v Speaker 0>rules all talk about one thing on the left and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.820
<v Speaker 0>one thing on the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 0>And doing something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.420
<v Speaker 0>To one of them, or usually just one thing on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.220
<v Speaker 0>the right and just one thing on the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:03.560
<v Speaker 0>So there's the exchange will even.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.580
<v Speaker 0>That's one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.500
<v Speaker 0>So we're only looking at one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.970
<v Speaker 0>But often when I'm deciding what to do here, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.040
<v Speaker 0>might be looking for a rule that I can apply

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.760
<v Speaker 0>to a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.420
<v Speaker 0>And it might be that what's in gamma is just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.120
<v Speaker 0>some stuff that is going to be carried around for

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.040
<v Speaker 0>several steps in the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.600
<v Speaker 0>We're doing short proofs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.120
<v Speaker 0>So even if you look at proofs like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.490
<v Speaker 0>This one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.360
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.810
<v Speaker 0>So if you look at this proof here, then once

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.960
<v Speaker 0>we've broken down the right hand side, you with a

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.230
<v Speaker 0>comma on the right so that this p splits off

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 0>into the comma.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.760
<v Speaker 0>Remember that bit okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.980
<v Speaker 0>So this p is now being carried all the way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.940

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 0>without ever changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.470
<v Speaker 0>So it's not what we're focusing on and all the

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 0>things we're not focusing on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 0>We can shuffle off into Delta on the right or

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 0>gamma on the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, and where does the other way of thinking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 0>it come?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 0>So that's this idea of thinking about gamma as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 0>background assumptions at this stage in the proof, when we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 0>look at the Venn diagram, this is the Venn diagram

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:26.040
<v Speaker 0>for A entails B, which remember says the a only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.770
<v Speaker 0>bit is empty because every A must be in here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 0>in B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 0>But when we have the gamma in here A entails

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.900
<v Speaker 0>B is only true when all of gamma are there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.120
<v Speaker 0>as well, because we need the gamma and A to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.990
<v Speaker 0>entail B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.050
<v Speaker 0>So in terms of the Venn diagram, it's saying we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.860
<v Speaker 0>know it's empty provided that gamma holds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.440
<v Speaker 0>And here I'm just splitting the universe into the bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 0>where gamma all hold and the bit where any of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 0>gamma doesn't hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not really sure that the diagram is terribly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 0>useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 0>It's there for people who like diagrammatic reasoning.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 0>because he put all these Venn diagrams in in the

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 0>first place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm a symbolic reasoner, so it doesn't do much for

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 0>me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 0>But some people like diagrams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah, since I've said that.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 0>So in your own view of yourself, how many people

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.610

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 0>Diagrammatic reasoners?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 0>Very few.

<v Speaker 0>Very few, but slightly more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.310

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:44.050

<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.520
<v Speaker 0>How do you reason?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.270
<v Speaker 0>Comes up with.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.220
<v Speaker 0>How do you program as well?

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.090

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.390
<v Speaker 0>And I'm sure that observation is addressed to many more

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.280

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.050
<v Speaker 0>In maths you can't do maths by trial and error.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.390

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.380
<v Speaker 0>The process of actually constructing a mathematical proof can involve

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.450

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.440
<v Speaker 0>then you have to do the rigorous steps and you

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.130

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 0>And I will light this up a bit more neatly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 0>and post it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.980
<v Speaker 0>Saving it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 3>For the existential assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,91]}

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 3>And just be a Venn diagram with an exercise for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 3>neutral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42]}

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 3>That's it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 3>That's how.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,16]}

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And for the week six material, can you post the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,69]}

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 3>reading that we should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,82]}

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.370
<v Speaker 0>Yes yeah I will arrive as soon as I get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:38.060
<v Speaker 0>back to my office.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.500
<v Speaker 0>I'll publish the week six stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.950
<v Unknown>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:40.220
<v Unknown>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.990
<v Unknown>Hi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming a second time to ask about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.840
<v Speaker 3>So the second I left, I completely forgot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[27,100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay, so why is the not feeling good?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,99,100,89,89]}

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Because there can't be something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,98,100,60]}

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.010
<v Speaker 0>They can't know they're not P is there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:02.120
<v Speaker 0>Because it came in from here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.850
<v Speaker 0>So we have a rule that says this thing is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.980
<v Speaker 0>an and that's the end in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.880
<v Speaker 0>So the rule for sorry the rule for and on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.310
<v Speaker 0>the right says you break it into two trees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.580
<v Speaker 0>So this p is two there this and carries to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,42,100,26,91,100,96,96,100]}

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.090
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.560
<v Speaker 0>And then this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.180
<v Speaker 0>Not pork goes there and this not P goes there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:23.840
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 3>So he did he did the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,86,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.170
<v Speaker 1>He did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92]}

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.490
<v Speaker 3>At the same time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100]}

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.880
<v Speaker 0>Um or for the P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:32.630
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.730
<v Speaker 0>So so this P is just being carried through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.660
<v Speaker 0>This is being carried through as part of a delta

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.470
<v Speaker 0>on the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.270
<v Speaker 0>So we're not doing anything to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.620
<v Speaker 0>In this world, we're focusing entirely on this formula here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.750
<v Speaker 0>And it's an end formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,66,100]}

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.820
<v Speaker 0>So we break it down and we have to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.290
<v Speaker 0>two separate subtrees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.680
<v Speaker 0>One there for this half, one there for that half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.690
<v Speaker 0>And the P is just the stuff on the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.490
<v Speaker 0>that's unchanged when we do this bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.130
<v Speaker 1>We understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,72]}

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.020
<v Speaker 4>What I want just for clarification again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 4>So according to existential rule this uh what for us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,77,100,100]}

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:21.210
<v Speaker 4>would be like not implies equals to this um, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.590
<v Speaker 4>would be easier to draw towards like this lower c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,76,58,100,100,99]}

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:26.610
<v Speaker 4>not implies a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,41,100]}

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 0>So C does not imply a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.640
<v Speaker 4>C implies not a no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 0>Because this says that every C is not A, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 0>this says that some sea is not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 4>So I thought existential assumption would work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,48,92]}

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 4>It makes it equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:44.800
<v Speaker 4>No not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 4>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 4>What does existential assumption here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,76]}

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 4>How do we see it says.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.240
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it says what it says, which is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 0>It just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Speaker 0>It says something exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 0>So universal statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 0>Assert for all something or other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 0>But they don't assert the existence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Or existence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,99]}

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 4>So again, so the social assumption we're talking about for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 4>example, and modal logic and thought about all universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,48,94,100,26,44,92,15,99]}

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 4>And the assumption comes down to language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,91,100,93,93,38]}
