WEBVTT

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 0>Thank you all for coming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 0>I hope it's worth your while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I said I would fulfil the promise to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 0>tell those of you who wanted to know about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 0>Something about how these things were done a few hundred

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 0>years ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 0>So these are actually slides I prepared for my institute

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 0>lunchtime talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 0>So they're not originally aimed at you, but that's okay

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 0>because there's only a little bit that is a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 0>more formal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 0>So I started by explaining to my colleagues who generally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 0>don't know syllogisms what a syllogism is in modern notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 0>And since it's been a few weeks since we've done

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 0>them, this should be familiar, but maybe the reminder is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 0>helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 0>So we talked about a universe and predicates, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 0>defined entailment which is basically a disguised universal implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 0>And we had the notion of categorical proposition from Aristotle,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 0>which was one of these things with a entails B,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 0>not B or a does not entail not B or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 0>whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 0>And we said we can flip things around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 0>And we introduced the syllogism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,84,100]}

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 0>We didn't write it down quite like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 0>So this is just annoying mathematician abstraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 0>But it means exactly what we wrote down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 0>I'm just using a few symbols because I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 0>later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 0>And then I explain to them how we can derive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 0>all the sound syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100]}

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 0>So that's what we did during the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 0>We said that we have this basic sound syllogism, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 0>was called Barbara, for reasons that we're now going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 0>understand, and that all the others can be got from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 0>Barbara by doing one of four operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 0>So we can substitute for predicates by other predicates, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 0>by negated predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 0>We had double negation cancellation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.990
<v Speaker 0>We had contra position on sequence flip and negate, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,92,100,100]}

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 0>we had contra position on rules flip and negates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100]}

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, have you all learned your Greek alphabet?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 0>How many of you know what this letter is and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 0>are not Greek?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100]}

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 0>Capital Epsilon okay in there just because I like Capital

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 0>Epsilon as a letter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what did Aristotle do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 0>Aristotle did not have this notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 0>So he talked about, as we said, the notion of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 0>a universal affirmative proposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 0>So this is translating Greek into English but not doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 0>anything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 0>And he didn't actually express it as, um, every Greek

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 0>is human.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 0>He expressed it as human is true of every Greek.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 0>And in medieval times they introduced a handy symbolic abbreviation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 0>for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 0>Curiously, the medieval logicians were quite happy to use Latin

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 0>letters rather than Greek letters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, so they wrote A of a B for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100,100]}

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 0>universal affirmative a wholes of every b, we would write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,74,31,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 0>it as every b is a And they introduced a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 0>similar abbreviation E for the negative no B is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 0>or in Aristotle's phrasing, a holes of no b, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.210
<v Speaker 0>then the particular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 0>These are what we call the existential ones I, a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,63]}

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.519
<v Speaker 0>b is the particular affirmative a holds of some b,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,99,74,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 0>so there is some b that of which a holds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,52,100,100,98,100]}

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.370
<v Speaker 0>and o is the negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.560
<v Speaker 0>There is some B of which A fails to hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Speaker 0>And the way you're supposed to remember these magic things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 0>a e I o r that afirmo has a and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,98,100,100,61,100,75,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.440
<v Speaker 0>I in it and means I affirm and nego has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,27,100]}

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 0>e and o in it, and means I deny, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure is very helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 0>And there was a lot of terminology about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 0>And if you learned all this stuff until quite recently,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.670
<v Speaker 0>you had to learn all this terminology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.550
<v Speaker 0>I think it's much easier in modern logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 0>So these a and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 0>So this is things like humans Greek mortal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 0>We call them predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.140
<v Speaker 0>They were called terms in the premodern logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 0>And confusingly a that is um, what is a human

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 0>or mortal is the predicate, and B that is Greeks

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 0>or mortals, Greeks or humans are the subject.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 0>So here predicate and subject are being used in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 0>linguistic grammatical sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.930
<v Speaker 0>If you did grammatical analysis in any remotely formal sense,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 0>you talked about, um, the dog bit the man.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 0>The dog is the subject of the sentence and bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.380
<v Speaker 0>the man is the predicate of the sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 0>So that's how the the terminology was used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, we also remember mentioned at some point that Aristotle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 0>didn't believe in talking about fiction, and that means he

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 0>had the existential assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.430
<v Speaker 0>This is something I have to explain to my colleagues,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.810
<v Speaker 0>because we don't do it now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.640
<v Speaker 0>And we saw at some point that that meant that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.390
<v Speaker 0>A holds of every B and A fails of some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.720
<v Speaker 0>B are not actually the negatives of each other as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.390
<v Speaker 0>they are in modern logic and the way we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.810
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.940
<v Speaker 0>But for Aristotle, they weren't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.770
<v Speaker 0>They were two different statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 0>So that was a bunch of terminology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 0>Then there's yet more terminology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.580
<v Speaker 0>Again, this is translated from Greek into English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 0>So Aristotle then talked about different styles of argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 0>And in English we talk about different figures of argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.560
<v Speaker 0>So a figure is more or less what we've been

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Speaker 0>calling a syllogism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.170
<v Speaker 0>It's a premise two premises and a conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 0>And these things have the property that the two premises

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 0>share something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 0>So in the standard example, the two premises share human

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 0>and human is the subject of the first and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 0>predicate of the second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.350
<v Speaker 0>So we have a major premise, as it's called, containing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Speaker 0>the predicate or predicate of the conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.870
<v Speaker 0>So in the conclusion the predicate is mortal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 0>So the major premise is the one that contains the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 0>mortal predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.150
<v Speaker 0>And the minor premise is the one that contains the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 0>others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 0>So if you're learning this in traditional notation, you look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.730
<v Speaker 0>at the standard, the initial example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 0>All humans are mortal, blah blah blah, and you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.430
<v Speaker 0>label all the bits in it as being subject, predicate,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 0>and whether they belong to the middle term or the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 0>major term or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 0>And just for good measure, the terms within the predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 0>So also given mid-major labels.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,98]}

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 0>So I find it extremely confusing and I just can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 0>remember it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.040
<v Speaker 0>So I do not remember it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 0>I have no need to remember it and nor have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.220
<v Speaker 0>you, but once upon a time you would have had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71,71,100,100]}

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.120
<v Speaker 0>to remember it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 0>So why is he talking about figures?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 0>Because arguments have different structures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 0>So if you think about Barbara, Barbara says all humans

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 0>are mortal, all mortals, and so all Greeks are mortal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,43,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.840
<v Speaker 0>and therefore, no, sorry, all Greeks are human and therefore

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.580
<v Speaker 0>all Greeks are mortal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 0>If you write that in the medieval notation, then the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 0>shared term looks like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 0>So figures of the so-called first time kind are Barbara

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.300
<v Speaker 0>like figures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 0>And then there are several other ways you could permute

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 0>the terms, so the shared term might be in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.970
<v Speaker 0>first position in each one, or it might be in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.930
<v Speaker 0>the last position, or it might be at the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.910
<v Speaker 0>So here we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.580
<v Speaker 0>The first kind is where the shared term is at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 0>the end of the second and the beginning of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 0>first term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.450
<v Speaker 0>The fourth kind is when the shared term is at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.720
<v Speaker 0>the beginning of the first and the beginning of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.790
<v Speaker 0>second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.120
<v Speaker 0>Now, we were pretty lax about swapping things around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.670
<v Speaker 0>We said, it doesn't matter what order you put things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 0>in too often, but remember, these are actually categorical statements,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.100
<v Speaker 0>so the order matters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, very confusingly, Aristotle didn't recognise this kind of argument

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.580
<v Speaker 0>as a different kind of figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.220
<v Speaker 0>He treated it as a special kind of first figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.100
<v Speaker 0>And I tried to understand that, and I read people's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.990
<v Speaker 0>analysis of it, and I still don't know what he

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.920
<v Speaker 0>was doing there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.660
<v Speaker 0>So there was definitely some confusion going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.580
<v Speaker 0>Now all the way through this course, we have been

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.730
<v Speaker 0>misusing the term syllogism okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75]}

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 0>Because actually for Aristotle, a syllogism was something that was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 0>sound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.890
<v Speaker 0>So in Aristotle's terminology, what we have been calling a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.640
<v Speaker 0>syllogism was actually called a figure, the Greek for figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,99]}

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.030
<v Speaker 0>And what we have been calling a sound syllogism was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.860
<v Speaker 0>what he called a syllogism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm not quite sure where that shift in terminology happened.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.070
<v Speaker 0>I think it happened between the medieval era and modern

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.370
<v Speaker 0>logic, but it's what we have at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.980
<v Speaker 0>So we've got figures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.290
<v Speaker 0>That is what we were calling syllogisms, and we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.960
<v Speaker 0>to decide whether they're sound or unsound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.980
<v Speaker 0>When we looked at Barbara, we stared at it and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.350
<v Speaker 0>said, that's obviously sound, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 0>Because it's implication and transitivity of implication, blah blah blah

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.520
<v Speaker 0>blah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 0>It's obviously sound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 0>Or you can prove by prove it by truth tables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 0>If you believe truth tables are sound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, Aristotle did the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 0>So for any syllogism that was in what he called

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 0>the first figure, that is where the shared term of

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 0>the premises looks like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Like the Barbara style, he said each one is either

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 0>self-evidently sound or self-evidently unsound according to whether it was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.280
<v Speaker 0>or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 0>Then for the second, third and variance of the fourth,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 0>he did the same kind of argument that we used

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 0>to determine whether they were sound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 0>But because he had the existential assumption, he had some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 0>other things he could do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember, that's the affirmative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 0>That's the particular affirmative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 0>So this is some B is a and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 0>some A's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.760
<v Speaker 0>B if you remember the existential statement is symmetrical.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.450
<v Speaker 0>If some A's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58]}

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.760
<v Speaker 0>B then it follows that some b is a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.190
<v Speaker 0>So he had that symmetry rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:05.850
<v Speaker 0>Similarly with the negative one negative universal because he had

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.300
<v Speaker 0>the existential assumption, he could also say that if I

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 0>know all B or A, then I know that some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.990
<v Speaker 0>A's b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, he had contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.980
<v Speaker 0>So he was able to do proof by contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.180
<v Speaker 0>And there was a thing called thesis.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.030
<v Speaker 0>Which was an argument that is not quite understood and

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.660
<v Speaker 0>is generally believed probably to be wrong, but he only

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.740

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.770
<v Speaker 0>a strategy that may be familiar to some of you

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.260
<v Speaker 0>until you found a better way to do it.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.290
<v Speaker 0>It's something that mathematicians.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:51.110
<v Speaker 0>So when mathematicians fall into error, usually the error is

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.650
<v Speaker 0>usually using a faulty argument argument to prove a correct

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.850
<v Speaker 0>We don't often prove things that are false, although it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.460
<v Speaker 0>And for unsound things he had the notion of counterexamples,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.210
<v Speaker 0>so it was all quite familiar in the way that

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.400
<v Speaker 0>Then what happened?

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:25.760
<v Speaker 0>Well, in Europe, the period between about 414 hundred was

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.840

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 0>By the early second millennium, then medieval logicians in Europe

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.400

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.070

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.430

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.970
<v Speaker 0>There was a lot of other stuff going on.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.860
<v Speaker 0>So Aristotle did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.120
<v Speaker 0>Aristotle tried to do something that we now call modal

<v Speaker 0>logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Modal logic is about reasoning about what must be true

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.890

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.660
<v Speaker 0>So it's the rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,90]}

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.270
<v Speaker 0>So if it must be the case that it must

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.010

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.180

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.400

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Aristotle tried to do an analysis of this kind of

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.230
<v Speaker 0>So Borodin was approximately 500 years ahead of his time,

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:41.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, however, your average logic student probably didn't study modal

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 0>logic, but they did study syllogisms and they had this

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 0>horrible terminology and they didn't have our nice modern notation.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 0>So how did they learn which syllogisms were sound?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 0>Well, they learned it by memorising this rhyme.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 0>How you pronounce this depends on which bit of Europe

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 0>Well, okay, I will attempt to do what in pre-World

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, nowadays, we wouldn't do that if you were an

<v Speaker 0>Italian.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.940

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.020

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.430
<v Speaker 0>might say, salad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61]}

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.190
<v Speaker 0>And instead of children, or in some places you might

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.940
<v Speaker 0>But I mean, it doesn't have any particular structure to

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.560

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.960
<v Speaker 0>it, and it's not too hard to learn by heart

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.250
<v Speaker 0>if you want to do so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.100
<v Speaker 0>And the reason you do this is that each of

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.030

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.870
<v Speaker 0>all of them, they name one of the syllogisms, and

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.270
<v Speaker 0>they not only name it, they tell you what it

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.970
<v Speaker 0>is and how to prove that it sound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 0>So how does this work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.130
<v Speaker 0>We'll look at Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72]}

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.120
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.710
<v Speaker 0>So the first three vowels of Barbara are a, a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,79]}

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.100
<v Speaker 0>a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.340
<v Speaker 0>And that tells you what kind of the categorical propositions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.550
<v Speaker 0>are, because a is the universal affirmative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 0>So we know that this is all, all, all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 0>And then the first letter is b, c, d or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.760
<v Speaker 0>f.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 0>And that tells you what the shape of the proposition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 0>is in Aristotle's term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 0>First figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 0>Second figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 0>Third figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.420
<v Speaker 0>Fourth figure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 0>So Barbara has the shape a b b c a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 0>c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 0>So that gives us the shape that we know and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 0>love for Barbara.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.910
<v Speaker 0>And we saw Brent somewhere in the lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,18,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 0>So if you go back you can check that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 0>had that shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.420
<v Speaker 0>Um and then so that tells you what the syllogism

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 0>And then some of the other letters tell you how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 0>to derive the ones that are not obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.770
<v Speaker 0>So here is one Dorothy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,62]}

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.440
<v Speaker 0>Says if all ASC and all b a c, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60,100,100]}

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.490
<v Speaker 0>some a is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 0>B this is not true for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.210
<v Speaker 0>This needs the existential assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.330
<v Speaker 0>So this is one that was true for Aristotle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 0>And this letter p here after the r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.250
<v Speaker 0>So it would be T but dart up t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,39,100,100]}

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.460
<v Speaker 0>The p tells you that there's an instantiation of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.370
<v Speaker 0>universal thing to an existential thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.260
<v Speaker 0>Because this is Aristotle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.420
<v Speaker 0>If you know that every C is B, you know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.560
<v Speaker 0>that some b is C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.880
<v Speaker 0>So that tells you how to prove that and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.230
<v Speaker 0>end up with daddy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 0>Another thing that you can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.800
<v Speaker 0>So you might be able to swap the subject and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.340
<v Speaker 0>predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.760
<v Speaker 0>So for the existential ones every a is so a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,43]}

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.260
<v Speaker 0>some A's B is equivalent to some B is A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.990
<v Speaker 0>no, a is B is equivalent to no, b is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.410
<v Speaker 0>a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 0>So with data C, then you need to swap b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.160
<v Speaker 0>and c here and you get something that is Dari

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,47]}

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.880
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you want to swap the premises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 0>So when we did syllogisms, we just assumed we could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 0>swap premises because it just made sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.350
<v Speaker 0>But they had this terminology of major premise and minor

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.740
<v Speaker 0>premise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.080
<v Speaker 0>So you have to have an explicit rule that says

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.420
<v Speaker 0>you can swap two premises around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.480
<v Speaker 0>So the letter M told that you could do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.200
<v Speaker 0>So chemistry is the m between the r a and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.070
<v Speaker 0>the E tells you that you can reduce this to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.980
<v Speaker 0>something with an E and an A, which is Callard

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.060

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.870

<v Speaker 0>So yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.040
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,76]}

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.010
<v Speaker 0>So I think they chose a word that existed if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.450
<v Speaker 0>they could think of one at the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what's part two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.140
<v Speaker 0>I promise to say a bit more about regular expressions

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.290
<v Speaker 0>that we were talking about last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.310
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.980
<v Speaker 0>That is not working properly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.110
<v Speaker 0>Is it because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.550
<v Speaker 0>It's a non-standard slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,79,100]}

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 0>Because I don't want you seeing the next slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.410
<v Speaker 0>I just want you seeing the current slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is another talk I gave to my institute

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 0>after I started teaching this course, because in the course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 0>of teaching this course, I learn more about regular expressions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 0>than I had previously known.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 0>And I thought this stuff would be fun for them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 0>And then what about you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 0>So this is regular expressions as we teach it to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 0>you, and you will do more of them next year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember I talked about the computer science

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 0>notation versus the programming notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.320
<v Speaker 0>So we have the input symbols single letters, empty string,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,65,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:35.910
<v Speaker 0>concatenation, union, which we might write with the set union

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 0>symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.300
<v Speaker 0>And we have the star that's the looping operator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:43.890
<v Speaker 0>E star means any number of repetitions of whatever E

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.940
<v Speaker 0>does, and we use brackets all over the place in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.110
<v Speaker 0>the usual way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.330
<v Speaker 0>I don't think I even said that because it's just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.110
<v Speaker 0>obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:58.800
<v Speaker 0>And we can't do intersection and complementation and negation with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.120
<v Speaker 0>regular expressions, because we can't do them with nondeterministic automata

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,97]}

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.900
<v Speaker 0>nicely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.030
<v Speaker 0>If we want to do complement and intersection with nondeterministic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,88]}

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 0>automata, we have to turn them into deterministic ones, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.900
<v Speaker 0>blows them up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.140
<v Speaker 0>So this is theory I mentioned programming notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.500
<v Speaker 0>So where did the programming notation come from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.540
<v Speaker 0>Well in real life that meant mostly Unix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.830
<v Speaker 0>And for a long time there were two programs grep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.390
<v Speaker 0>and then later e grep um, which are what you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,45,100,66,97,97,100,100]}

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.610
<v Speaker 0>use to search for things in a file.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:42.890
<v Speaker 0>And the Unix notation is letters concatenation union written with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.080
<v Speaker 0>a bar, the star parentheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,97,100]}

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.350
<v Speaker 0>And then all this sugar that I mentioned last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.520
<v Speaker 0>So syntactic sugar remember is stuff that makes it easier

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.130
<v Speaker 0>to write but doesn't give you any new power.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.700
<v Speaker 0>Anything that is an A, B or a C something

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.290
<v Speaker 0>that is not A to Z.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.880
<v Speaker 0>It's something that can make sense in a word, an

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.470

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.310

<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.820

<v Speaker 0>of regular expressions, you write one and it matches anywhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.270
<v Speaker 0>in the string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.380
<v Speaker 0>But we often want to anchor it as it's called

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.210
<v Speaker 0>to the beginning or the end of the string, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.890
<v Speaker 0>is what we did when we were doing them with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:45.790
<v Speaker 0>automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is the expression that matches the entire string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.450
<v Speaker 0>in the comma omega.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.270
<v Speaker 0>And in everyday life, it's useful to have things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.430
<v Speaker 0>match at the beginning or end of a word, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100]}

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.180
<v Speaker 0>example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.750
<v Speaker 0>So this is a string that matches the word v,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.670
<v Speaker 0>because the backslash b is a special symbol that matches

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.850
<v Speaker 0>the empty string, provided it becomes between a letter and

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.750
<v Speaker 0>a non letter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.940
<v Speaker 0>So match is the edge of the word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,100,69,100]}

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.530
<v Speaker 0>And there are lots more of these things.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.690
<v Speaker 0>And actually there are more of them than I can

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:20.440
<v Speaker 0>remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.130
<v Speaker 0>And this stuff is still syntactic sugar, but I reckon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.170
<v Speaker 0>you might have to think a little bit about how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.420
<v Speaker 0>you will write down the automaton to do them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, particularly with the zero width things, you can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:36.040
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, then things changed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:47.440
<v Speaker 0>So Larry Wall, the great Larry Wall invented the programming

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.780
<v Speaker 0>language Perl, which I may just have mentioned a few

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 0>times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.950
<v Speaker 0>And Larry was Larry invented Perl for a very, very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.970
<v Speaker 0>practical reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.430
<v Speaker 0>It was his job to produce a large number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.990
<v Speaker 0>reports about data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.400
<v Speaker 0>And so he invented Perl as a language to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.190
<v Speaker 0>it very easy to produce reports about data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:16.899
<v Speaker 0>So Perl may possibly stand for practical extraction and report

00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:17.740
<v Speaker 0>language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:23.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, or alternatively, it stands for pathologically eclectic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.030
<v Speaker 0>Rubbish.

<v Speaker 0>Mm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42]}

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.030
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.370
<v Speaker 0>You had a talk from Phil on Monday, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:33.090
<v Speaker 0>Phil is one of the leaders of the programming language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:33.450
<v Speaker 0>group.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.060
<v Speaker 0>He probably thinks he's the leader of the programming language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:36.389
<v Speaker 0>group.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.909
<v Speaker 0>But other people might have different ideas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.659
<v Speaker 0>And whatever they do, Perl is the opposite of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.159
<v Speaker 0>So every principle of good language design, Perl does the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:47.790
<v Speaker 0>opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.710
<v Speaker 0>So I've told you, most of my programming is in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.399
<v Speaker 0>Perl.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.030
<v Speaker 0>And the general idea of Perl is if you see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.120
<v Speaker 0>something that looks cool in some other language, steal it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.470
<v Speaker 0>Very much in the way that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.160
<v Speaker 0>So the same approach that English takes to other languages,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.500
<v Speaker 0>Perl takes to programming languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.040
<v Speaker 0>That, by the way, is why my poor tutorial group

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.580

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 0>this lecture here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:26.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, so lots of things which you will learn about

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 0>at various points associative arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 0>If you've done PHP programming, you know about those references

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 0>we haven't told you about.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.420
<v Speaker 0>Call by name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.630
<v Speaker 0>You may learn about at some point dynamic binding, static

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.170
<v Speaker 0>binding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.280
<v Speaker 0>If you do advanced language classes or whatever there is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.860
<v Speaker 0>Perl probably has it and it never gets rid of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.430
<v Speaker 0>anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.600
<v Speaker 0>So Perl is very backwards compatible for 40 years or

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.110
<v Speaker 0>so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.870
<v Speaker 0>Not entirely, but as much as you can be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and if there's stuff in other languages that people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.320
<v Speaker 0>think is good but it gets in your way, then

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.340
<v Speaker 0>forget about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.950
<v Speaker 0>So we've been telling you why types are a good

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.520
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.050
<v Speaker 0>Perl's attitude types is, well, it might be convenient to

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:13.100
<v Speaker 0>have strings and numbers, but it's also convenient if I

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.280
<v Speaker 0>automatically convert between them whenever I think it would make

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.660

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.650
<v Speaker 0>Very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.450
<v Speaker 0>So Perl wasn't the only language that was pushing for

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.140
<v Speaker 0>more complicated regular expressions, but it's the most influential.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.610
<v Speaker 0>I say probably actually, it just is, because nowadays we

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.680
<v Speaker 0>have things called Pcrs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51]}

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.880
<v Speaker 0>I mentioned them last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:45.940
<v Speaker 0>Perl compatible regular expressions or preposterously convoluted regular expressions.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.860
<v Speaker 0>That's a Larry ism, of course.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:57.310
<v Speaker 0>And those things have spread like some ghastly disease, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.790
<v Speaker 0>they found their way back into even the original Unix

<v Speaker 0>utilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.080
<v Speaker 0>So once upon a time, grep was a nice, simple

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 0>you can with some reservations because as we'll see, regular

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.950

<v Speaker 0>So what can you do?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 0>This is something I mentioned again quite late in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 0>last lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.360
<v Speaker 0>When we actually use regular expressions in real life, we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 0>not just saying does it match, we want to know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.620
<v Speaker 0>which bit of the input matched.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 0>And in real life we have cleaning star and alternation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88,97,89,97]}

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 0>So that's supposed to be non-deterministic but we can't do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.820
<v Speaker 0>non-determinism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.970
<v Speaker 0>So as I said we have deterministic nondeterminism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 0>So here's an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.970
<v Speaker 0>In normal regular expression syntax this means look for an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,48,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 0>angle bracket followed by any number of anything followed by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 0>an angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.210
<v Speaker 0>So dot means any character and star means any number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:12.720
<v Speaker 0>of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.830
<v Speaker 0>So you might hope that this would find XML HTML

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 0>tags.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.600
<v Speaker 0>And if you don't know what XML tags are, they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.060
<v Speaker 0>are like HTML, but more general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61,100,100]}

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 0>And so in particular, they are extremely annoying to deal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 0>with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.090
<v Speaker 0>Does this find the tag irritating when I match it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.350
<v Speaker 0>against this input?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.650
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.490
<v Speaker 0>Anybody think otherwise?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:48.120
<v Speaker 0>Actually, by default it finds the bit between irritating and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.200
<v Speaker 0>that irritating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:57.120
<v Speaker 0>Because the general approach to star is this says any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,72,100]}

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.380
<v Speaker 0>number of anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.920
<v Speaker 0>Well, we could say that means that number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.620
<v Speaker 0>Or we could say it means that number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.080
<v Speaker 0>It's non-determinism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,55]}

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.910
<v Speaker 0>So if this were actually a non-deterministic finite automaton, both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.070
<v Speaker 0>these paths would be accepting paths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.000
<v Speaker 0>We can't do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.990
<v Speaker 0>What do we do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.260
<v Speaker 0>in real life.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.820
<v Speaker 0>Regular expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.030
<v Speaker 0>We implement this in what is called the greedy way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.310
<v Speaker 0>When you're trying to match this, you swallow up as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.460
<v Speaker 0>many characters as you can with the star, and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.620
<v Speaker 0>you see if you can find the angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.950
<v Speaker 0>So if you take the greedy approach, you read the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.990
<v Speaker 0>angle left bracket, then you read dot and you keep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.680
<v Speaker 0>going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.960
<v Speaker 0>So actually you keep going all the way to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.940
<v Speaker 0>end and then you say, whoops, I can't find an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.630
<v Speaker 0>angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.930
<v Speaker 0>So I go back one back one back one, back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.400
<v Speaker 0>one until I hit there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.610
<v Speaker 0>And now I've read as many dots as I possibly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.740
<v Speaker 0>can and then find an angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,60,100,95,100]}

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, often this is not actually what you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 0>For example, if I wanted to pull out the tag

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 0>irritating from here, what I want is the opposite of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.950
<v Speaker 0>greedy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.200
<v Speaker 0>I want the thing that swallows up as few things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.100
<v Speaker 0>as possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.000
<v Speaker 0>And in traditional Unix regular expressions, you had to work

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.040
<v Speaker 0>around it by doing things like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 0>Let me look for an angle bracket followed by three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,35]}

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.520
<v Speaker 0>things that are not an angle bracket as often as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 0>possible, and then an angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 0>And this gets very boring very soon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 0>So in modern Perl compatible regular expressions, we can write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.480
<v Speaker 0>star query to mean swallow up as few things as

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.470
<v Speaker 0>possible, and then find an angle bracket so that finds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.110
<v Speaker 0>the tag irritating in the sequel.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, is it obvious that doing this isn't giving you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 0>any more expressive power?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 0>It's maybe not totally obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.700
<v Speaker 0>This particular one doesn't, because you can always work around

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 0>it by doing something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 0>But that's not the only way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.790
<v Speaker 0>Why do I say this is calling backtracking behaviour?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Because what this is saying is we want to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 0>as little backtracking as possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 0>So always look to see if you can find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.610
<v Speaker 0>angle bracket, and if you can then stop swallowing up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.600
<v Speaker 0>with the star.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.930
<v Speaker 0>Whereas the standard implementation says swallow off as much as

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.810
<v Speaker 0>possible and then back off until you can find an

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.680
<v Speaker 0>angle bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, another thing, and actually this is something we do

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:36.780
<v Speaker 0>So the university email system is extremely annoying, right?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:39.930
<v Speaker 0>Do you find it extremely annoying or are you just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.040
<v Speaker 0>There are two standard approaches.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.830
<v Speaker 0>One of them is to say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.780
<v Speaker 0>I will use a magic escape character.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.120
<v Speaker 0>It's called an escape character because it somehow escapes from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.320
<v Speaker 0>the special meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.230
<v Speaker 0>Says this quote is not the end of the string,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.880
<v Speaker 0>it's actually the actual character.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.980
<v Speaker 0>Some languages do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.390
<v Speaker 0>By doubling the character you want, but this is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.000
<v Speaker 0>most common one in languages today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, now JavaScript is a language which allows you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:08.010
<v Speaker 0>quote strings with either single quotes or double quotes as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.830
<v Speaker 0>long as you match them, which is actually quite useful

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 0>because in JavaScript is used for writing web applications and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 0>in web applications, you are putting a lot of text,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 0>and you often want to put quotes or double quotes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 0>in the text.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 0>PHP does the same if you are doing web programming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,81,100,100,100]}

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 0>So if we ignore the matter of escapes, then this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 0>is a match for a JavaScript string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.450
<v Speaker 0>And what it says is the string begins with either

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 0>a double quote or a single quote, and I'm putting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.600
<v Speaker 0>brackets around it to tag that as a single thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 0>that I can talk about later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 0>Then it has anything, any number of times, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.870
<v Speaker 0>want it to be greedy because we don't want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 0>see any, quote, symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 0>And then it has the same kind of quote we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:56.960
<v Speaker 0>saw at the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 0>So in particular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 0>That's a good string because I see a double quote

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.290
<v Speaker 0>and then I swallow anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.230
<v Speaker 0>I swallow anything, as few of anything as possible until

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 0>I see another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:22.060
<v Speaker 0>Whatever I saw first and equally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 0>That's a good string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Speaker 0>Recognise that expression.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100]}

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.110
<v Speaker 0>So that's quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and in this particular case, it's fairly obvious that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.600
<v Speaker 0>you could do it with old fashioned regular expressions too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.920
<v Speaker 0>However, you can also write down something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:50.080
<v Speaker 0>This says I read some number of A's and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.150
<v Speaker 0>I read a B, and then I read the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.430
<v Speaker 0>number of A's as I read before the B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.910
<v Speaker 0>This is not something that can be done with finite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:58.750
<v Speaker 0>automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.010
<v Speaker 0>So you will prove this in inf two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,84]}

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.340
<v Speaker 0>But you might like to think about why you can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.170
<v Speaker 0>do it with finite automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 0>And even worse, this is a thing that says I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 0>read a string and then I read the same string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's also not something that can be done with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 0>finite automata, and it can't even be done with some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 0>more powerful notion of automaton that you will meet next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 0>year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's skip that because you don't know about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 0>So you might ask if you add this stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 0>What is the power of the expressions you get?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 0>It's certainly more than finite automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 0>And it's more than these are called pushdown automata, these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 0>things that let you do more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 0>But what is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.380
<v Speaker 0>And actually, I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 0>And I can't find anybody who's gone to the trouble

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 0>of tying it down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 0>Precisely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is common.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 0>So lots of languages allow you to use back references.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,98]}

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's only the beginning of the stuff Perl does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.100
<v Speaker 0>So it also does things like let me look ahead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.600
<v Speaker 0>without actually doing a match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.360
<v Speaker 0>So this says I want to read a string of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:14.720
<v Speaker 0>digits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.260
<v Speaker 0>So backslash D is a digit at least one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.770
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.770
<v Speaker 0>And when I get to the end look ahead to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.650
<v Speaker 0>check that it's followed by a word but don't actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:26.300
<v Speaker 0>include the word in the match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.420
<v Speaker 0>So this is sort of peering ahead but not actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.410
<v Speaker 0>eating the word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:36.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is something that I wrote down in an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.800
<v Speaker 0>attempt to match a standard floating point number, and later

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.240
<v Speaker 0>realised that I got it wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.410
<v Speaker 0>So I'll put the slides on back on the page

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.580
<v Speaker 0>after tomorrow's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.950
<v Speaker 0>So if you want to do the exercises, you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.790
<v Speaker 0>um, and this kind of thing is quite powerful because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.440
<v Speaker 0>it means you can do intersections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.070
<v Speaker 0>So if I say at the beginning of the string,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.460
<v Speaker 0>look ahead to see if it matches pattern one and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.780
<v Speaker 0>then swallow pattern two, that means that the string matches

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.470
<v Speaker 0>pattern one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.510
<v Speaker 0>Intersection pattern two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:14.360
<v Speaker 0>So suddenly we've got intersection of regexp and therefore intersection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.680
<v Speaker 0>of finite automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.680
<v Speaker 0>And I think that this doesn't have any power, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100]}

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.150
<v Speaker 0>I'm not entirely sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, I think I won't talk about backtracking control because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.820
<v Speaker 0>it's a bit complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, then we get recursive regular expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.130
<v Speaker 0>So one of the most annoying things about regular expressions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.890
<v Speaker 0>is that you can't use them to match brackets, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.110
<v Speaker 0>matching brackets is what you want to do in every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:45.950
<v Speaker 0>programming language you ever write or ever analyse, and also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:48.380
<v Speaker 0>in your English if you want to write, well, decent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:48.980
<v Speaker 0>English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so Perl will let you write a regular expression

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.450
<v Speaker 0>to match a balanced parenthesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,76]}

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.080
<v Speaker 0>So what it says is, well, the parenthesis starts with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100]}

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 0>something that is a bracket followed by An arbitrary number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 0>of things that aren't brackets, either open or close, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Speaker 0>it ends with a closing bracket preceded by an arbitrary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 0>number of things that aren't open or closed brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,85,100]}

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 0>And in the middle it's got the same regular expression

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:19.780
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 0>So this is a recursive call of the same regular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 0>expression, which is quite cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is a famous example of a non regular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,80]}

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 0>string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 0>This can't be matched with finite automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 0>You will prove that next year as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.470
<v Speaker 0>But this very simple recursive regular expression matches it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's pretty bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100]}

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 0>Very useful, but pretty bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 0>But because Perl is Perl, it actually lets you write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 0>an arbitrary program inside the regular expression, which can look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 0>at what has been matched so far and do stuff

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 0>with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have never seen this in practice because I

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 0>don't think I can't imagine why you would want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100]}

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:05.100
<v Speaker 0>do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, it does have a manual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:11.790
<v Speaker 0>Perl has a very good manual for its regular expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.100
<v Speaker 0>Here's a couple of key extracts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:23.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 0>Now let's get back to good old fashioned regular expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 0>Have you ever come across a website that has failed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.190
<v Speaker 0>to validate an email address?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 0>If you have nice, simple email addresses, you won't have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.380
<v Speaker 0>this problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.320
<v Speaker 0>But if you have any slightly sophisticated email address, an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64]}

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.690
<v Speaker 0>email addresses can be a lot more complex than you

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:43.650
<v Speaker 0>think they can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:46.110
<v Speaker 0>And how do people validate them?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.810
<v Speaker 0>They match them against some regular expression, which they dreamed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.400
<v Speaker 0>up because they thought they were clever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you actually want to validate email addresses according

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.840
<v Speaker 0>to the email standard, the right regular expression looks like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.440
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.160
<v Speaker 0>Uh, it goes on a good bit further down the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.720
<v Speaker 0>page, and that doesn't even address the fact that you

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.760
<v Speaker 0>can put comments in regular expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that was regular expressions in everyday life.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.630
<v Speaker 0>And that's today.

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:19.580
<v Speaker 0>So tomorrow is infinity big numbers and some pretty pictures.
