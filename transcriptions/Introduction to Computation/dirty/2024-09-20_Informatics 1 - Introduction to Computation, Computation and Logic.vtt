00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.590

<v Speaker 2>previous lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.290

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And yesterday one of you asked me if I could

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 2>So never feel shy about asking a question.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Um, here's a little thing that some of you might

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.460

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess you watch films on phones or possibly even

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.020

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.020

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>So in order to do that, you need to do

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.980

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.490
<v Speaker 2>tutorial and see how many different answers you get.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.920

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.690
<v Speaker 2>do it right now, and we'll have an answer in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 2>five minutes, but if I have time at the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 2>of the lecture, then I'll take any answers from the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.630

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Now, I don't know what the answer is, I can't

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 2>remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I have a note somewhere, but frankly, who cares?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.140

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to do today is move on

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.980

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 2>in this course and is more fun.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.830

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I said that logic was the language of reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Why do we need a language of reasoning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Because the language we speak and write is often ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.620
<v Speaker 2>It's often imprecise, which is usually often a good thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 2>And it's also very verbose and long winded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 2>It takes us a lot of words to say something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 2>that could be specified precisely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>And this is true even when people are trying really,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.360
<v Speaker 2>really hard not to be any of those things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And this is why we have lawyers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately, lawyers do not get trained in logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And over the last four weeks, I had a very

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.790
<v Speaker 2>painful experience with a lawyer who doesn't understand basic logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 2>So logic is useful if you ever have to argue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Why is logic core to a computer science course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Because informatics is fundamentally mathematics and logic applied to things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Speaker 2>that are going to do computing for us.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we have mathematics and logic is because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.840
<v Speaker 2>they enable us to talk clearly, precisely and concisely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.660
<v Speaker 2>But perhaps more importantly, they require us to talk clearly,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 2>precisely and concisely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>It's quite hard to be imprecise in mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.360
<v Speaker 2>It's possible to write down a precise mathematical statement without

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.490
<v Speaker 2>understanding what you're writing down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>And I imagine that you've had that experience at some

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Speaker 2>stage in your mathematics learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 2>But what you wrote down had a meaning, even if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.560
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the one you intended.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So logic is a language, an artificial language intended to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.630

<v Speaker 2>same way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to be starting with something which most

<v Speaker 2>If you've done computer science at school, you've probably seen

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.450
<v Speaker 2>this before.

<v Speaker 2>If you haven't, you might not.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So if I say propositional logic, Boolean logic, how many

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>How many of you think you should know what I

<v Speaker 2>mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>If you remembered what happened last year or two years

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>ago?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay, so not as many, which could mean computer science

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 2>syllabuses have changed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 2>So yesterday we were talking about reducing our conversation to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>a series of yes no statements or questions.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Well, the question is something that comes from a statement,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to use a technical term proposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's written in purple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,92,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 2>It's something I'm defining for the purposes of this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So a proposition is something that is a statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>It's simple in some way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's either true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So here are some examples of statements that might be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>considered to be either true or false.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>The moon is round.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>It is raining here and now I like mooncakes.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>That book is yellow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Um, so I said that those were simple statements, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>they're not really simple statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Is the moon round?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,96]}

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it's sort of round in much the same

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.340
<v Speaker 2>way that the Earth is sort of round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.320
<v Speaker 2>It depends what you mean by round, doesn't it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.710
<v Speaker 2>In most useful conversations, the moon is round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.770
<v Speaker 2>But if by round you mean perfectly spherical, then of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.730
<v Speaker 2>course it isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.150
<v Speaker 2>So there's an complexity there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100]}

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.110
<v Speaker 2>What do we mean by round the moon?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I suppose we agreed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Is it raining here or now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Well, that depends whether by here and now I mean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.600
<v Speaker 2>inside this lecture theatre or whether I mean up there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.380
<v Speaker 2>outside.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.920
<v Speaker 2>So again, that apparently simple statement has a lot of

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 2>external information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 2>I like mooncakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Well, I'm the one speaking, so presumably I'm the only

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to it is in fact, yes.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Until I ate one too many and then I haven't

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Um, that book is yellow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a quite a complex linguistic statement because it has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of language in there which is

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.270

<v Speaker 2>Is that book yellow?

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Or that book is yellow?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 2>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 2>A true false statement.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Or at least it's not logical in the sense of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 2>logic that we're going to be talking about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It's more to do with linguistics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Semantics is the area of linguistics we might be talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 2>What does a word mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,65,100,100]}

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's not the kind of logic we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 2>assume that we know what we're talking about, and all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 2>our questions have definitive answers about whether they're yes or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 2>no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Um, any questions or challenges about that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 2>So quite often during the course, I'm going to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 2>statements and some of them will be obvious and some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>of them will be obvious and false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So if you think I might have made an obviously

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 2>a statement that is false, do shout because it might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 2>be deliberate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Um, I don't have any plan for this lecture as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 2>far as I know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>So because we're working as mathematicians or logicians or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 2>We're going to introduce symbolic notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of useful convention that we use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>in maths and in logic to save words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:50.530
<v Speaker 2>So conventionally I'm going to use uppercase Letters from about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the alphabet from Pcast.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And those are going to be things that stand for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 2>propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 2>And most of the time, I don't really care what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>propositions they stand for, because I'm going to be reasoning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 2>abstractly about what we can do with propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 2>But occasionally I might want them to talk about a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 2>particular proposition, such as the moon is round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So the key things are propositions or statements that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100]}

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to use letters such as P and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Q to range over them, as we say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we experience in this course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 2>is that Don and I are both both mathematicians, computer

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 2>50 years standing, which means we have forgotten what it

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 2>was like not to be a mathematician or logician.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Speaker 2>So if I use a word and you don't know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.110
<v Speaker 2>what it means, or you don't know what it means

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.100
<v Speaker 2>in the context.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Shout because there will be others, and it will simply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.920
<v Speaker 2>mean that I've forgotten that it wasn't taught in school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.370
<v Speaker 2>So I try to avoid these because every year I

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.060
<v Speaker 2>learn a new one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.820
<v Speaker 2>But please shout as soon as there is anything you

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.930
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay, so what can we do with propositions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.210
<v Speaker 2>The statement that the moon is round is not all

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.470
<v Speaker 2>that interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Well, I suppose it is interesting because it tells us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.700
<v Speaker 2>a lot about the nature of the universe and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.590
<v Speaker 2>solar system and the way it formed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 2>But for more complex forms of reasoning, we usually want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.190
<v Speaker 2>to be able to start with some proposition and end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.090
<v Speaker 2>up with another proposition, because we know something and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.980
<v Speaker 2>want to work something out from it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 2>For example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:55.070
<v Speaker 2>If you get 71% on an assessment, then that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.370
<v Speaker 2>a grade A, so that's a rule that is actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 2>embedded somewhere in the university's regulations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And there's a reasoning process that takes you from Mark

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.780
<v Speaker 2>greater than 71 to grade is a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Um, so much of logic is about combining propositions in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.730
<v Speaker 2>some sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of logic is about combining combining propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.720
<v Speaker 2>So the question is how many ways can we combine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.230
<v Speaker 2>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.150
<v Speaker 2>And this is where things can get a bit confusing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 2>to start with, because we use words in logic with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.430
<v Speaker 2>very specific meanings, although those words are also everyday words,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.530
<v Speaker 2>where they also have a meaning that we think we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 2>understand and that may not be precisely the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.780
<v Speaker 2>So one of the main combinations in logic is, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we all know what and means in most

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.290
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So if I say p and q, I mean that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.320
<v Speaker 2>p is q and q is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And that sounds like a circular definition, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.210
<v Speaker 2>But it is because I have to define logic in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.230
<v Speaker 2>terms of something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Where things get slightly more interesting will be a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.090
<v Speaker 2>in the next operator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.480
<v Speaker 2>But another thing I need to warn you about logic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.060
<v Speaker 2>is that there are lots and lots of different notations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Because it's an old subject.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Modern logic is not so old.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Modern logic is about 150 years old, but it's changed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.800
<v Speaker 2>a great deal over those 150 years.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And people's preferred notations vary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 2>So when I want to write and and I'm talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.230
<v Speaker 2>in logical sense, I will usually use a symbol, because

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Um IDE or curiosity?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,95,100]}

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.440
<v Speaker 2>How many of you know what ampersand means as a

<v Speaker 2>word?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.510
<v Speaker 2>So you know it means this symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.490

<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.340

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.280

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.520
<v Speaker 2>So why is this particular symbol called an ampersand?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.450

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Ampersand is actually a contraction by natural usage for the

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.459
<v Speaker 2>means by itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:20.620
<v Speaker 2>So this means and by itself.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.800

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.830
<v Speaker 2>um, and that also demonstrates interesting linguistics things because we

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.240

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's a process of assimilation which is common in

<v Speaker 2>language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's a nice word useful for both basic phonology

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.830
<v Speaker 2>and is pretty straightforward.

<v Speaker 2>Any questions about and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.500
<v Speaker 2>So who knows.

<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay, so those of you who haven't seen truth tables,

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.320
<v Speaker 2>they're very boring things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I write in the columns the values of P and

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I write in the row, the value of q.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.950
<v Speaker 2>And in the table I just write down what the

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.230
<v Speaker 2>So false and false is false.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.450
<v Speaker 2>False and true is true.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.280
<v Speaker 2>True and false is false.

<v Speaker 2>False.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a tabulation, the logical equivalent of a

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.580

<v Speaker 2>A more interesting conjunction is or.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:03.800
<v Speaker 2>So when I say p or q and the word

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.990

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:19.220
<v Speaker 2>when at least one of p and q is true.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And you'll notice I've already confused matters by saying at

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.320
<v Speaker 2>least one of P and Q when I'm talking about

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:24.800
<v Speaker 2>or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62]}

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.800
<v Speaker 2>But I hope you see what I'm meaning there.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>So P or q is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Speaker 2>If p is true or q is true, or both

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>are true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Does that match with the way you use or in

<v Speaker 2>everyday language?

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.940

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.360

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.190

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>In logical usage, the plain or always means one or

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.530

<v Speaker 2>That might be.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:31.950
<v Speaker 2>You will not get an MSC distinction if you don't

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 2>get a distinction on the coursework, or you don't get

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.740

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>So in the way our MSC works, to get a

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.690

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you fail either of them or both, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a distinction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.400
<v Speaker 2>But frequently in everyday life we mean one or the

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:56.880
<v Speaker 2>other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.950
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody offers you an apple or an orange,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to get one unless you explicitly say,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.630
<v Speaker 2>actually, I'd like both, which may not be what they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.340

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.740
<v Speaker 2>In modern logic, we tend to like this symbol.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.030

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.570

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Really what this is saying is that false and or

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.240

<v Speaker 2>go together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see more of this later on, and eventually

<v Speaker 2>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100]}

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.840
<v Speaker 2>There's another proposition way of combining propositions that we use

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.210

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So not the negation of a proposition is true exactly

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 2>when the proposition is false, which I hope is what

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.920

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.650

<v Speaker 2>it.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.050

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 2>not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 2>It probably has some other name that I don't know.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Older logicians will use the twiddle, and if you want

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 2>to be formal about it, it's called a swung dash.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 2>But twiddle is easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we will use an over bar to say not

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>But our main symbol for negation is this, um, dash

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.330
<v Speaker 2>We can write a truth table for it.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a simpler truth table because there's only P, so

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.360

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Is it generally easier to show that something is true,

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.840

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's easier to show that it's not

<v Speaker 2>All right.

<v Speaker 2>have been.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Is it easier to demonstrate that an alteration has been

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.870
<v Speaker 2>done, or to demonstrate that nothing has been done?

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean, if an alteration has been done, then at

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.210
<v Speaker 2>least you can see it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.890
<v Speaker 2>But how do you look at the whole thing and

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.290
<v Speaker 2>say nothing has been done?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Um, so there is a sense in which this is

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.580
<v Speaker 2>true in logic as well, but that's a more complex

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.510
<v Speaker 2>form of logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So proving something is something is usually easier than proving

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that you can't prove something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.060
<v Speaker 2>But proving something false is a different matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.410
<v Speaker 2>But for most purposes negation is easy because we know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.490
<v Speaker 2>what true and false are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 2>We have possibilities true and false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And if we have the negation, we just flip them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Where it gets complicated is if you have a don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.530
<v Speaker 2>know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:51.040
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know whether something is true, but then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I also don't know whether it's false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880
<v Speaker 2>And so negation becomes more interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.730
<v Speaker 2>There are logics for dealing with that which I might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.430
<v Speaker 2>possibly mention right at the end of the course, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.130
<v Speaker 2>for our purposes logic is very straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:11.110
<v Speaker 2>So I've given you three ways of combining propositions and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.730
<v Speaker 2>or and not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So if we have combinations then we can build up

<v Speaker 2>complex things.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:27.190
<v Speaker 2>In basic arithmetic you have plus minus times divide and

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.190

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.490
<v Speaker 2>You had to do evaluate expressions by hand, whereas now

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you probably use calculators or hopefully not.

<v Speaker 2>ChatGPT.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Um, so I can write down an expression like that.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.960
<v Speaker 2>So if I say, what does that mean?

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I want to go somewhere else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Or not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,78]}

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically reading the statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>What does the statement say?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100]}

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Notice the brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So we use brackets in logic in the same way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.660
<v Speaker 2>that we use them in arithmetic.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.730
<v Speaker 2>This means the sort of main operator here is an

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.450
<v Speaker 2>or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying that either this is true or this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.980
<v Speaker 2>is true or both.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And this thing on the left says that both P

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.540

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.270
<v Speaker 2>And this thing on the left says that it's not

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.570
<v Speaker 2>the case that both R and S are true.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.480
<v Speaker 2>So rather useless statement because you don't know what p,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 2>q, r and s is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.410
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that we can take arbitrary propositions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:50.900
<v Speaker 2>and build them up in the normal mathematical notation with

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.380

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.720
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully that's just familiar notation, maybe with some new

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.650
<v Speaker 2>symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Any questions about it or comments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you think I need to tell you any more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.980
<v Speaker 2>ways of combining propositions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.240
<v Speaker 2>A couple more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100]}

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to or are they just handy?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:40.820
<v Speaker 2>So actually, these four propositions are enough for all the

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.550
<v Speaker 2>possible ways you can combine propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:48.890
<v Speaker 2>And it's a reasonably good exercise to check that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.740
<v Speaker 2>So I mean maybe not check it in detail, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.760
<v Speaker 2>go and convince yourself that every possible way of combining

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.590
<v Speaker 2>two propositions can be written in terms of and or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:07.580
<v Speaker 2>not, but in everyday reasoning, and especially in mathematical everyday

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.390
<v Speaker 2>reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a combination of propositions that we use a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:16.880
<v Speaker 2>more than the others, in fact, and that is if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.770
<v Speaker 2>then implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:25.880
<v Speaker 2>So if I write if P, then q, then what

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean is that if whenever p is true, q

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.690
<v Speaker 2>has to be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.640
<v Speaker 2>If P, then q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.760
<v Speaker 2>That is the combination you use in most of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.980
<v Speaker 2>mathematical reasoning you do, because all mathematical, all mathematical theorems

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.970
<v Speaker 2>have the form.

<v Speaker 2>If something is true, then something else is true.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And again, there are lots and lots and lots of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.940
<v Speaker 2>symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.330
<v Speaker 2>So you will see people using a single arrow.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.790
<v Speaker 2>You will see people using a double arrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>You'll see people using this thing which looks like a

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.730
<v Speaker 2>back, which looks like a superset symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.020
<v Speaker 2>And many others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.080
<v Speaker 2>The one we're going to use is the single arrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And again, this is an operator which can be defined

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.240
<v Speaker 2>with a truth table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.810
<v Speaker 2>It works like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 2>So this is p implies q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 2>False implies true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 2>False implies true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 2>True implies false is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 2>True implies true is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So look carefully at this first row here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Does that actually make sense to you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.250
<v Speaker 2>How many other people find it slightly disturbing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Why is it a bit disturbing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, because he is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76]}

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 2>If P is false, shouldn't you be false as well?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,98,100,100]}

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And this truth table says that if P is false,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.570
<v Speaker 2>then it's okay for Q to be either false or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 2>true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.760
<v Speaker 2>So this is the single biggest difference between logic and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.810
<v Speaker 2>everyday life.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 2>So to give you an example, here is an if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.880
<v Speaker 2>then statement with two propositions in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And I want you to tell me whether the if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.230
<v Speaker 2>then statement is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:50.020
<v Speaker 2>If the moon is made of green cheese, then I

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.010
<v Speaker 2>am a banana.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.160
<v Speaker 2>It's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Which seems a bit odd.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.090
<v Speaker 2>The reason it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Why do we do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Why do we do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally, we do this because things work better if we

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:15.610
<v Speaker 2>do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.100
<v Speaker 2>And the real reason we do it is that we're

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.440
<v Speaker 2>just talking about yes and no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.090
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have any idea of an actual connection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.170
<v Speaker 2>between things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 2>So the statement I just made is absurd, because there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 2>no possible reasonable connection between the moon being made of

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>green cheese and me being a banana.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean, unless maybe you say the only way the

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>moon can be made of green cheese is if an

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.360
<v Speaker 2>evil wizard has done it, and he might turn me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 2>into a banana.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.180
<v Speaker 2>So the kind of logic we're dealing with has no

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>conception of connections between propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 2>It only knows whether they are true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,52,100,100,100]}

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And in that setting, if you don't know anything about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 2>if you know that P is false, then the safest

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 2>thing to do is say, I don't know anything about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 2>It could be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 2>It could be false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 2>So if then is a statement about P being true,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 2>making a positive requirement that Q is true and not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 2>the other way round?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79]}

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Not about the negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a buzzword for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100]}

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 2>It's called the problem of material implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.919
<v Speaker 2>So this kind of implication is called material implication because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:36.290
<v Speaker 2>it only looks at the matter, the content of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.649
<v Speaker 2>proposition, and doesn't think at all about whether there's any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 2>sensible relation between them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 2>So if we look at what P implies, Q says,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.940
<v Speaker 2>if we look at that truth table, consider this statement

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 2>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Either q is true or p is false, q or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 2>not p so Q is true or p is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>If you check this formula against that truth table, you'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.700
<v Speaker 2>see that they're the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100]}

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 2>So we don't actually need the implication operator around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 2>We could always just write it out like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 2>However we tend to think in terms of implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.220
<v Speaker 2>We think in terms of one thing implying another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.950
<v Speaker 2>So this is a very useful operator to have for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.600
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of human reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.510
<v Speaker 2>But it is also important in a lot of cases

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 2>to be able instantly to convert it to this form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So try to get that into your brains now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 2>And again, just a side note going on to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>The reason this first row looks odd is because it

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.640

<v Speaker 2>Whatever you form, whatever you have on the right of

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the arrow, false implies it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.640
<v Speaker 2>At the moment we're only talking about propositions, but later

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 2>in the course we'll get on to proving things, proving

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 2>theorems, taking some assumptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 2>And in normal mathematics, in normal logic, it's also the

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>case that if you can prove false, then you can

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 2>prove everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 2>So the Latin term for that which was popular when

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 2>logic was a philosophical subject, is ex Folsom quarterly bit

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.770
<v Speaker 2>out of falsehood.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 2>You can get anything you like.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that's used a lot is because it's

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.360
<v Speaker 2>what underlies proof by contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 2>So I guess in your school maths you have done

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>how many people have done proof by contradiction at school?

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>So most but not all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You're going to see more of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Proof by contradiction actually relies on force behaving in this

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 2>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 2>There is a more refined branch of reasoning and logic

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.880
<v Speaker 2>where that's no longer true, but that's a harder to

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 2>deal with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay, any questions about if and then.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Was that a question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 2>But.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.740
<v Speaker 2>You have to shout really loud from back there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Or, you know, you almost.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,99,98,93]}

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.060
<v Speaker 4>How is that possible?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,39,41]}

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Well, just so just check the truth tables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.590
<v Speaker 2>So take this expression, write down the truth table for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.740
<v Speaker 2>it, and you'll see that it's the same as that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.710
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about it without looking at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.320
<v Speaker 2>truth table P implies q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.720
<v Speaker 2>That means if p is true, then q has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.500
<v Speaker 2>be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.470
<v Speaker 2>If q is true, then we have nothing to check

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 2>because p can be true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.050
<v Speaker 2>If Q is not true, then P has to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.810
<v Speaker 2>false because otherwise P would be true, which would force

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Q to be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.650
<v Speaker 2>So you can do it by reasoning or you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.000
<v Speaker 2>just check the truth table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's all the logical combinators that we're going to

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.820
<v Speaker 2>use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.220
<v Speaker 2>A little bit later, we'll introduce 1 or 2 more

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.640
<v Speaker 2>that are useful for special purposes, but these are the

<v Speaker 2>Now I want to just make an observation.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.560

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's propositions, simple statements.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.830

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.840
<v Speaker 2>So in everyday life we want to make statements not

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.330
<v Speaker 2>just true or false, but we want to make statements

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.590
<v Speaker 2>about things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.270
<v Speaker 2>So if we look back at the proposition I had

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.240

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.410
<v Speaker 2>the thing I'm saying about it, which is is round.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Speaker 2>if you learned the grammar of your own language or

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>any other language in a traditional style, you may be

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.390
<v Speaker 2>familiar with terms like subject, predicate, and complement.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.900
<v Speaker 2>How many are familiar with that as a grammar term?

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Yep, there isn't enough old fashioned grammar teaching in logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.870
<v Speaker 2>We sometimes talk about such things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 2>So in logic, a predicate is a proposition about things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's the proposition is round about a thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And the point of a predicate is that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.930
<v Speaker 2>apply it to lots of different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.320
<v Speaker 2>So the predicate round can be applied to the moon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.850
<v Speaker 2>to say the moon is round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.430
<v Speaker 2>And I can also apply it to the sun and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.230
<v Speaker 2>say the sun is round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.250
<v Speaker 2>So now I've abstracted away from particular objects, and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.010
<v Speaker 2>have a notion of predicate which is about properties of

<v Speaker 2>objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:19.360
<v Speaker 4>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Is round is something that takes one argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.790
<v Speaker 2>As we say, it takes the object I'm talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.190
<v Speaker 2>the predicate like is something that has two arguments because

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:33.910
<v Speaker 2>the statement I like mooncakes can be plugged in with

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.400
<v Speaker 2>different things for AI and mooncake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Um, I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.490
<v Speaker 2>You like rigatoni.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So like is what we call a two place predicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.450
<v Speaker 2>So individual things might have names like the moon or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.050
<v Speaker 2>eye.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32]}

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And there's a misprint there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:01.630
<v Speaker 2>And we have variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.200
<v Speaker 2>We will use variables x and y lowercase x and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.740
<v Speaker 2>y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is the same kind of variable that you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.770
<v Speaker 2>familiar with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.530
<v Speaker 2>In mathematical usage you use a variable to range over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 2>numbers in a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.930
<v Speaker 2>So x and y refers to some arbitrary thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And we will represent predicates by the same letters as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 2>the propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 2>But we will give them arguments as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 2>So if p is a unary predicate like is round,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 2>then p of x is a proposition, and it means

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 2>that the predicate p is true of the thing x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So for example, is round applied to the moon, likes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 2>is a binary predicate, takes an x and a y,

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.940

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 2>So this would be likes I comma mooncakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,85,100,100]}

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Is that a reasonably comfortable notation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Are there any issues with that notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 2>It should be yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93]}

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Um, there are an awful lot of Latin and Greek

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 2>words floating around in mathematics in the days when everybody

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.200
<v Speaker 2>learned Latin and Greek at school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>That was fine, but that's no longer the case, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 2>many of you are from places where it would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.750
<v Speaker 2>quite reasonable, for you have learned Classical Arabic or Sanskrit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.720
<v Speaker 2>or Middle Chinese instead of Latin or Greek.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.500
<v Speaker 2>So unary means one issue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Binary means two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay, I just want to mention that there is one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.950
<v Speaker 2>very special binary predicate, which is equality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.060
<v Speaker 2>We're going to write equality in the usual way like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:02.420
<v Speaker 2>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.130
<v Speaker 2>So x equals y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.350
<v Speaker 2>This is true if x and y are the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 2>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.740
<v Speaker 2>In this course we won't get into the reasons why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.370
<v Speaker 2>it's special.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So in more advanced logic than it behaves slightly different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:14.000
<v Speaker 2>from others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>But for our purposes It's just a predicate that we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>going to write in a particular way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.240
<v Speaker 2>So I've told you about propositional logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to put up a little bit about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 2>first order logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to do first order logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 2>It makes us sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84]}

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 2>First order logic allows us to make more complex statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 2>So again, let me do a quick check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 2>These are the symbols usually used in modern maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.020
<v Speaker 2>How many of you are familiar with these two symbols?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 2>About one fifth or less.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>So we will introduce them a bit later because they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 2>have their uses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>So this is for all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 2>This says for every x p of x is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 2>And this says there exists an x such that p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 2>of x is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So you make statements like this in mathematics like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:22.380
<v Speaker 2>um, every prime number greater than two is odd or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of an existential statement right now, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you make statements that are true of all things, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.820
<v Speaker 2>you might want to exhibit an example of something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And the thing I want to say now is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.430
<v Speaker 2>this lets you say an awful lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So those of you who are CS math students are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100]}

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 2>probably going to do an analysis course this year, next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.020
<v Speaker 2>year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Third year there is definitely honours analysis, but you probably

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,93,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 2>do some analysis in second year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And in analysis you will see a concept called a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.770
<v Speaker 2>function from the rails to rails being everywhere continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,60,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 2>And you will see it written out defined like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 2>This is a complicated formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 2>It says for all something for all something there exists

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.930
<v Speaker 2>something for all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's an implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.800
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty much about the limit of where normal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.840
<v Speaker 2>humans can understand formulae.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:27.970
<v Speaker 2>So mathematicians have ways of understanding much worse formulae by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 2>breaking them down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 2>But it illustrates that first order logic is quite difficult

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 2>for two reasons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Firstly, it's hard to understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a very short formula, but it's already quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>hard to understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 2>And computers can produce formulae that are thousands of pages

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 2>The other reason first order logic is hard is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 2>if you write down an arbitrary statement in first order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 2>logic about an arbitrary universe, I can't necessarily tell you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 2>whether it's true or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why mathematics is not trivial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 2>If this were not the case, then mathematics would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 2>a trivial subject.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.370
<v Speaker 2>We could just feed it to a computer and get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 2>the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Um, first order logic is what mathematicians use in everyday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 2>life and much other reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a remarkably recent discovery about 140 years old.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 2>But because it's hard in both these ways, we are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 2>not going to teach you first order logic in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 2>course, except a bit right at the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to do in this course is to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 2>teach you something that is a bit more powerful than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 2>propositional logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 2>It lets you say useful things, but it's manageable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not so hideously complex as first order logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.420
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what we will introduce next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>We will introduce the logic that was developed about 2000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 2>years ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll spend a few years going through 1500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,34]}
