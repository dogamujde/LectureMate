00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 0>The show.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100]}

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 0>You'll all be glad to know that I tested negative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.559
<v Speaker 0>this morning, which is why I'm not wearing a mask.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 0>And so this lecture should be a lot more comfortable

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 0>than yesterday's lecture was for all concerned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yesterday I talked largely about contra position and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,69,100]}

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 0>the different ways in which we can apply contra position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,92]}

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 0>Earlier in the week, we applied it to sequence, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 0>now we've been applying it to syllogisms and generating more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 0>And we've been generating existential syllogisms where we say, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 0>aid is not entail C, which means that there is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 0>an A that is not C, so that makes it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 0>existential statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 0>I left you a few things to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 0>Not particularly going to go through them because they were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 0>supposed to be fodder for the tutorials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 0>What I want to do today is wrap up with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 0>So we will go back to categorical propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 0>Think about them a little bit more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 0>Think about how we've derived one syllogism from another, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 0>have a look at the complete set of available valid

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.760
<v Speaker 0>syllogisms that we can use, and finish off with a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 0>comment about the thing that I've mentioned a few times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 0>so far, the existential assumption, and I'll explain a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 0>more about how that works and why it was a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 0>bit of a mess for Aristotle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 0>So any questions from yesterday?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 0>Any questions about this composition stuff?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 0>The syllogisms we introduced yesterday with existential statements in them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 0>So let's go back and think a little bit about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 0>the categorical propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 0>So when I introduced categorical propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 0>I said they had the form every or no is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 0>B or not B, and the reason we've been looking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 0>at them is that they're more general than propositional logic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 0>because they have quantifiers every or no or some, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 0>they are not as powerful as full first full first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 0>order logic, which is too much to cope with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 0>And we've seen several forms of categorical statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 0>We've seen every human is mortal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 0>We've seen the opposite of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 0>No human is immortal, and we've seen existential statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, some human is Greek, some human is not Greek.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 0>And for Aristotle and the tradition that grew up from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 0>Aristotle until the 19th century.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 0>These were considered to be the four canonical forms of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 0>categorical proposition, and they were given English or Greek and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 0>Latin originally Greek, of course, later Latin, and then later

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 0>English terms called universal affirmative because it's a universal statement

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 0>about everything, and it's affirmative because it's saying something positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 0>Every A is B universal negative, which is talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 0>everything and making a negative statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 0>No, A is B, and the traditional terms in English

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 0>here were particular because you're asserting that there is one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 0>particular a that has the property B or here some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 0>particular A that has the property, not B, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 0>represented them in Venn diagrams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,57]}

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 0>So we have the shading here to say where something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 0>is not happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 0>There are no A's that are not B, there are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 0>no A's that are a B and noticed that I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,75,89,100,57,100,100]}

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 0>negating and flipping around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 0>And here we assert the existence of some particular object

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.910
<v Speaker 0>which sits in A and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 0>And here we assert the existence of something that sits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Speaker 0>in A, not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 0>And notice that the diagonal statements contradict each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 0>So if every A is B that contradicts the statement

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 0>that some A is not B, and similarly these contradict.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, the observant amongst you will have seen this bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.620
<v Speaker 0>in small print up here, which says that these are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 0>not exactly Aristotle's categorical propositions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't looked ahead at the next slide,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 0>can you guess why it's not exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh, you see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,68,97]}

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because there's negations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,43]}

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, because there's negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 0>So the negation is Aristotelian.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 0>So on the left side, Aristotle didn't like negation, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 0>on the right side it was okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 0>The existentialism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,74]}

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 0>Well, I said I was going to talk about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 0>existential assumption, didn't I?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 0>So that's why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 0>This is something that some of you have also been

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 0>tempted to assume.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 0>There have been various questions on Piazza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 0>I think too many of them were private questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 0>And let me again discourage private questions unless you're really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 0>revealing your solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.810

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.870

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.400

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.950

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 0>something that is both A and C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 0>If we plug these things together we get a diagram

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 0>that looks like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 0>So this grey shading is carried over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 0>This existential thing has carried over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 0>Now, this is where the diagrams get a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 0>ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 0>Is this central diagram an unambiguous representation of the merge

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 0>of these two diagrams?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 0>Anything where I've been, where there's some imprecision there that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 0>really I ought to tidy up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 0>The order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 0>The, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97]}

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 0>If the order in the order is fine, it doesn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,40,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 0>really matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.250
<v Speaker 0>So are you asking why is he in the middle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 0>C is in the middle because it is the middle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 0>term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 0>It's the term that joins the two premises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.080
<v Speaker 0>That's a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 0>So I think I haven't said that explicitly, but when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 0>you draw these diagrams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 0>The way we draw them, we put on the top

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 0>the variable that is in both the two premises and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 0>here that is C and C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 0>It's not those two, it's the one that is shared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 0>So that's a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.300
<v Speaker 0>But I've done something in the diagram which isn't completely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 0>justified when I merged.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 0>So in here I put an x and that x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 0>is representing an object anywhere in this region okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 0>Whereas down here I've left the x where it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 0>But actually the x could also be in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 0>Now that's okay because this region is shaded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 0>And therefore I know that there isn't an X in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.930
<v Speaker 0>And therefore the x that was in this region must

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 0>actually be in the right hand half of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 0>But that's a little argument that I have to make.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 0>And it's quite a subtle one, so you might miss

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay, what happens when I pull out the C?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64]}

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 0>I'm expecting to get a premise that a diagram that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 0>corresponds to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 0>Well, I do, because if I pull out the C,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 0>then I get left with two partially shaded regions and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 0>the white paint spills over and all the shaded regions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 0>disappear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 0>And the X is still sitting in here somewhere, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 0>now corresponds to this region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 0>And so I get a diagram that corresponds to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 0>conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 0>Some programmer is fallible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 0>Assert the existence of a programmer who is not fallible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 0>Questions about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 0>It's a slightly more sophisticated diagram, proof than than one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100]}

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 0>we've done before because of these little things that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 0>have to think about on the way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 0>So anybody.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>So what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,99]}

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Unknown>Does it mean to be in a if somebody is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,81,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Unknown>not in the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,75]}

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 0>So if where are we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.370
<v Speaker 0>You mean back up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 0>So up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 0>Well X is in a right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 0>So this is some a is C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 0>Remember when you have the the negated thing A does

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 0>not entail not c means some a is C which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 0>is always very hard to remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 0>But if you think of it you can either think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 0>about it each time, which is what I end up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 0>doing, or you can try to learn it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,98,55]}

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 0>How do we compare?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 0>Does not entail to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 0>Or so which.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99]}

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 0>Which thing in Haskell or so or in Haskell is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 0>the or of a list, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,89,88,100,100]}

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 0>So if you are implementing does not entail then yes,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 0>you would be using an Or when you've got lots

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 0>of premises on either side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 0>But we haven't got on to having lots of premises

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 0>on either side yet, so we will get on to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, so more generally that's a comment about duality, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.290
<v Speaker 0>I've mentioned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 0>So, or is the dual of the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 0>And if you take a big and of things and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 0>you apply negation to that, you get the or of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,74]}

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 0>the negation inside.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,89]}

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 0>We will see a lot of that later, but not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 0>yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let me give you one to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 0>So here is a putative syllogism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, and at this point, I like to do another

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 0>of my little linguistic surveys, because this is quite a

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 0>slow lecture and I have plenty of time to do

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 0>random things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 0>So there is this word I'm going to give you

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.950

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 0>uses which pronunciation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.390
<v Speaker 0>So who says fungi?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 0>Who says fungi and who says fungi?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Speaker 0>Good grief.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay, congratulations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 0>A fungi is a very old pronunciation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 0>It's so old that even I don't use it.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 0>So I'm curious where you got it from.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 0>What's your linguistic background?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 0>Dunno.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 0>Maybe you heard some 19th reading of a 1930s book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, why did people say fungi?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, because back in the day, Latin words in English

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 0>were pronounced as if they were English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 0>So in normal English spelling, g before I or e

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 0>is soft, therefore fungi and the letter ie is pronounced

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,94]}

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.070
<v Speaker 0>ie, so hence fungi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100]}

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.150
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 0>After the First World War, when we were Latins, teaching

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 0>in schools was changed and they started trying to use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 0>actual Latin pronunciation, and that kind of permeated its way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 0>through into normal, everyday English, with the result that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 0>are now completely confused about where the Latin words in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,82,100,100,100]}

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 0>English should be pronounced in a Latin way, in English

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,56,100]}

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.140
<v Speaker 0>way, or something horribly in between.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 0>So generally we do something horribly in between, like fungi

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 0>instead of fungi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 0>So here is the alleged syllogism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.890
<v Speaker 0>All plants are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.700
<v Speaker 0>What am I, fungi?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,56,56,95]}

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 0>Some flowers are not plants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 0>Some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 0>Therefore some flowers are not fungi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 0>Is that a valid piece of reasoning?

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.820

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 0>or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.230
<v Speaker 0>I heard an answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 0>I have some more answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.700

<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.390
<v Speaker 0>Any more votes for no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.830
<v Speaker 0>Somebody shouted no.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 0>That leaves an awful lot of people who haven't worked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, it gets tricky, doesn't it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 0>So three short sentences, and we have to think quite

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.990

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 0>or something that you might hear in an election address.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if we can actually work it out from

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 0>the Venn diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to do the merge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 0>And this time I'm going to be more careful about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 0>this x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90]}

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 0>So over here I have a entails b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 0>So that means everything that is A is also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 0>B there's nothing in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 0>Over here I have some C is not a.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 0>So that's asserting the existence of an X in here.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 0>And now when I merged the diagrams I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 0>be more careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.510
<v Speaker 0>I know this x is in here, but I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 0>know whether it's in here or in here.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 0>There might be X's in both places, but all I

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 0>know for certain is that there is at least one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 0>So there could be one in here, or there could

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.940

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 0>So what do I get if I pull out the

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 0>A?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 0>If I pull out the A then what changes the

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 0>white paint spills into here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 0>So this region is now white.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 0>Nothing is empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 0>And what I don't know is that there's an X

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 0>here, because I still only know that there might be

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.040

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 0>It might be over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 0>However this conclusion C does not entail B that says

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 0>some C is not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 0>I don't have a demonstration.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 0>This x might be sitting over here, so I have

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.060

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 0>actual example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 0>So if the x is here in the middle, then

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 0>the conclusion doesn't match what I have here.

<v Speaker 0>this middle region here, and that will satisfy the premise,

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.140

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.990

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 0>a universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 0>So when you're looking for counterexamples, you can invent any

<v Speaker 0>quants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 0>And let's assume that it's a fungus and a flower,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.570

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.330
<v Speaker 0>But that doesn't matter because we can create whatever universe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.800

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:33.350

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.500
<v Speaker 0>So what does the syllogism say?

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 0>All plants are fungi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 0>Well, this universe doesn't have any plants in it, so

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 0>that's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 0>Some flowers are not plants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 0>We have a cancer, which is a flower and not

<v Speaker 0>a plant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 0>So that's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 0>The conclusion claims that some flowers are not fungi, but

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.020
<v Speaker 0>we only have one flower and it is a fungus

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 0>So we've constructed a universe in which this syllogism fails

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.420

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.920

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 0>For.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.370

<v Speaker 0>Eh?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43]}

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.310

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 0>now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 0>Somebody shout a bit louder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 0>Tell me what to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm just an automaton.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 0>Shade this bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.230
<v Speaker 0>B entails a if there's nothing in B that is

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 0>not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 0>So if I do the merge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 0>I have an x that might be here.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.270
<v Speaker 0>Or might be there.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.450

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.790

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.000

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.960

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.720

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.620

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 0>follow that some flowers are not fungi.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.590

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.140

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.410
<v Speaker 0>We said, if you've got A, B and C, you

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.500

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.250
<v Speaker 0>In particular, we could substitute not B for B and

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Unlike Aristotle, we had double negation.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 0>Cancellation goes double, negations cancel.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 0>we had contra position within a sequent.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 0>And we did contra position between the conclusion and one

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.250

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:12.160
<v Speaker 0>Now these processes that we do are all things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 0>So if you substitute one thing for another, you can

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.730

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.660

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.630

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 0>So these are symmetrical processes means they also have the

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.030
<v Speaker 0>conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, a thing that has come up a couple of

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.330
<v Speaker 0>times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.320
<v Speaker 0>Let's repeat it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.870
<v Speaker 0>The way we are looking at syllogisms, it doesn't really

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.420

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, I don't have one written up, but we write

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.610
<v Speaker 0>one premise on the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.800
<v Speaker 0>One on the right makes no difference to us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.200
<v Speaker 0>In the traditional medieval, classical, medieval view, there is a

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.290
<v Speaker 0>It's not important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.500
<v Speaker 0>It was the way they were thinking at the time

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.080
<v Speaker 0>when they tried to systematise it, but it has no

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.400
<v Speaker 0>logical importance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 0>And we can check things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 0>So that sums up what we've done with categorical propositions

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 0>and Venn diagrams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 0>And also some rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.580
<v Speaker 0>So the final thing we did was to say we

00:36:53.580 --> 00:37:01.230

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I said go away, implement syllogisms, implement contra

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.360

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 0>Implement double negation cancellation in Haskell.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 0>Can you do it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 0>So a few people are confident that they can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 0>Who is currently confident that they cannot?

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay, that's a very uncommitted, unusually uncommitted bunch.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 0>Well, you're going to anyway, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 0>So you will find that actually it's quite easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 0>And also it's quite useful because there are a bunch

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.780

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 0>And writing this stuff by hand is horrible.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.380
<v Speaker 0>We have computers to do this stuff, so making sure

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 0>that the examples are correct is much easier to do

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 0>after you've implemented the stuff in Haskell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 0>So this will be coming up in tutorials for your

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, before I get on to the final closing comment

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.100
<v Speaker 0>about the existential assumption, any questions about anything we've done

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 0>in the last couple of weeks about syllogisms and categorical

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.180
<v Speaker 0>propositions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.620
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be pretty bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,62,62,67,63,63]}

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.760
<v Speaker 0>So is there always for you?

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, the question was, will there always be three circle

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.170
<v Speaker 0>Venn diagrams rather than four circle Venn diagrams or five

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.370
<v Speaker 0>circle Venn diagrams?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.620
<v Speaker 0>I realise I've lost the people on line again.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:14.340
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, is that a valid piece of reasoning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it's just a chain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,94,100]}

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.210
<v Speaker 0>But we don't really need to write things like this

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 0>because we can combine That and that using techniques that

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 0>we will currently just treat as normal mathematics.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 0>But we will later in the course, see how you

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.310
<v Speaker 0>can do this kind of thing formally so that you

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 0>can plug together chains of reasoning.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 0>So yes, Aristotle could have gone looking at syllogisms with

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 0>more than two premises, but he never did, and nor

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 0>did anybody else until later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 0>Well, until after we'd stopped doing syllogisms and done more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 0>powerfully and started working in modern logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.770
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, we will be talking about that fairly soon.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let me finish by saying a bit more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 0>about this existential assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 0>So we've told you a lot about Aristotelian logic.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 0>I knew almost nothing about Aristotelian logic before I started

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.330

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.430
<v Speaker 0>It's been an educational experience.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 0>I have even gone back and read some Aristotle, which

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 0>is an even more educational experience, and for good measure.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.520

<v Speaker 0>was something I didn't understand.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.560
<v Speaker 0>I don't actually know ancient Greek, so that was a

<v Speaker 0>pointless activity, but quite fun because you live in a

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 0>look at transcripts of Aristotle's works, whereas in my day

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 0>I would have had to go to the university library

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.450
<v Speaker 0>and navigate the twisty maze of passages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so as I said, he didn't believe in talking

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 0>about non-existent things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 0>When you say when you make a universal statement, you

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 0>are also asserting a particular statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 0>If you make this assumption, then there are more syllogisms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 0>that become valid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 0>So this is the one we've seen before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 0>No reptiles have fur.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.360
<v Speaker 0>All snakes are reptiles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.240
<v Speaker 0>Some snakes have no fur.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:43.180
<v Speaker 0>So that sounds like a reasonable piece of reasoning to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.560
<v Speaker 0>most people because it says, okay, reptiles don't have fur.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 0>Snakes are reptiles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100]}

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.910
<v Speaker 0>Therefore, there are some snakes that don't have fur, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}
