00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.380
<v Speaker 0>that there will be a delay before we tell you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96]}

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.920
<v Speaker 0>If it's this sort of problem, um, so it's better

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 0>out that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.930
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93]}

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.700
<v Speaker 0>So those are the people associated with the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 0>So what are we teaching you in this course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 0>There's two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 0>Two strands, um, that are uh separate but interwoven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.140
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to be teaching you functional programming using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 0>a language called Haskell, which is different from other functions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.970
<v Speaker 0>from other programming languages that you might have encountered before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 0>Has anybody used Haskell here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 0>I see a couple of hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 0>okay, but not very many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92]}

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 0>So many of you will have done programming before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, not all of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 0>So don't worry if you haven't, okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 0>Some of you might have an an awful lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 0>experience with programming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 0>So Haskell is different from what you will have seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 0>if you've done programming before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 0>So Haskell is on functional programming in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 0>Is computing based on calculation using data structures without states?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 0>I'll explain what I mean by states in the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 0>lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so this part of the course is Introduction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 0>to programming uh, also known as coding and algorithmic thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the lectures will be mainly on Monday and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 0>Tuesdays and they'll start, start tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 0>The, the actual content of that strand of the course,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 0>the second strand is logic and computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.240
<v Speaker 0>So this covers two very important topics in computer science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.070
<v Speaker 0>Symbolic logic, which is describing and reasoning about information where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.930
<v Speaker 0>everything is either true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.550
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, or at least the kind of symbolic logic you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.940
<v Speaker 0>going to be learning about is, uh, is a is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.310
<v Speaker 0>a logic where everything is either true or false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.810
<v Speaker 0>And the other part of this is finite automata.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.500
<v Speaker 0>This is computing based on, uh, it's a model of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,99,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.770
<v Speaker 0>computation based on moving between states and response to input.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,98,100,100]}

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.250
<v Speaker 0>It's very different style of computation from functional programming, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.460
<v Speaker 0>it's partly presented to show you that there's more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.800
<v Speaker 0>one, uh, alternative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.410
<v Speaker 0>So the first lecture on this is going to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 0>on Thursday by Julian, um, who will be starting off

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 0>with, I guess, the symbolic logic part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.880
<v Speaker 0>Why do we choose to teach you these topics?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.200
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we want to give you a good basis for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.850
<v Speaker 0>your future studies and informatics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100]}

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.740
<v Speaker 0>Whatever you end up doing here, um, in your studies,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.840
<v Speaker 0>whether it's, you know, AI or theoretical computer science or,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.230
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, robotics or machine learning or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we believe we, the School of Informatics, believes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.520
<v Speaker 0>that this gives you a solid basis for the study

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.050
<v Speaker 0>of all these other topics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.870
<v Speaker 0>And, um, there's interesting connections between these two strands of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.180
<v Speaker 0>the course, the functional programming on one hand and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 0>computational logic on the other hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 0>So that's that's cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.190
<v Speaker 0>We can exploit that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.450
<v Speaker 0>And these things have practical applications that we can refer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:28.900
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.290
<v Speaker 0>You won't be doing the practical applications in these course,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.420
<v Speaker 0>but we can at least talk about them as kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.140
<v Speaker 0>of motivation for why for why you're learning these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, uh, these, uh, this material is accessible to all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.460
<v Speaker 0>students regardless of your previous background.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.370
<v Speaker 0>So there are no prerequisites for this course, except that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.850
<v Speaker 0>we expect you to have a general background in mathematics,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 0>not because we need you to know specific things as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 0>much as we need you to be proficient in, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 0>know, manipulating formulas and things like that without making mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 0>So in particular, the reason we choose to teach you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 0>Haskell rather than something else is that almost none of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Speaker 0>you will have seen it before, which means that the

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay, it will be different from the programming you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 0>And it's also, uh, something whereas you've done no programming.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 0>It's a relatively easy kind of entry point to this

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 0>And finally, it demonstrates the intellectual depth of informatics.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 0>So this is not just technical skills.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.050
<v Speaker 0>So for instance I'm not teaching you how to write.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.660
<v Speaker 0>Well, I'll teach you how to write Haskell programs.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.790
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not just teaching you how to write tactical

<v Speaker 0>programs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to teach you how to think about programming.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.110
<v Speaker 0>Using Haskell as a vehicle for that.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.830

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.220
<v Speaker 0>FP and you get different marks and we throw away

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.560

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.930

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.280
<v Speaker 0>It's an exceptional mark.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:41.500

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.750

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.430

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.710

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.880
