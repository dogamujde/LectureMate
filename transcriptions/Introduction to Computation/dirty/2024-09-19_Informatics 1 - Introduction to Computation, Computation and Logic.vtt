00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.590

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 0>That's a very difficult question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 0>So we like to say treat university as if it's

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.800

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 0>I went to university and suddenly I was about halfway

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.600

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.870

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 0>The point of being university is to be around very

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.600

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 0>So what about lectures?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 0>Lectures are very bad as a means of transmitting information.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 0>So why do I still do lectures?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.479
<v Speaker 0>Because I think lectures can be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:39.229
<v Speaker 0>Not so much to ram information into your brains.

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't work for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 0>It does work for some people, but because they provide

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.920

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.630

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.540

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 0>It's just.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 0>I don't want you to go through what I went

<v Speaker 0>through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 0>But as you can see, I came out of it,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.260

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100]}

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 0>So let me just say a bit about me.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.520

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 0>I'm a mathematician by education.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 0>I'm a theoretical computer scientist by training.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 0>Afterwards, my PhD was in theoretical computer science.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 0>I've been here all my academic career.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 0>I have been a computer scientist until about the early

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 0>And so actually, mostly I do linguistics these days for

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 0>my research.

<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately, I'm in a school of informatics, which takes the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 0>So they're quite happy for me to do linguistics.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 0>Why am I teaching you rather, why am I enabling

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 0>you to learn on this course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 0>Well, obviously, the simple answer is because they needed someone

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 0>to do it, and they looked at me and said,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 0>you can do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 0>And I said, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 0>Great, that will be fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.650
<v Speaker 0>And it has been fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.350
<v Speaker 0>So last year was the most fun I've had in

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.240
<v Speaker 0>my entire teaching career.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.940
<v Speaker 0>And your challenge is to make this year even more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.390
<v Speaker 0>fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Which brings me to the question of why are you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.760
<v Speaker 0>here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.880
<v Speaker 0>So there are lots of reasons for going to university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.890
<v Speaker 0>So this is one of those questions where you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.510
<v Speaker 0>be shy to put up your hand, but if you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 0>not shy, then do so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.380
<v Speaker 0>How many of you are you here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.740
<v Speaker 0>Primarily because it's what you need to get the job

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.730
<v Speaker 0>you want afterwards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.180
<v Speaker 0>Don't ask me for advice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.290
<v Speaker 0>I'm a career academic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.540
<v Speaker 0>Ask the careers service for advice about jobs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, how many of you are here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.340
<v Speaker 0>Basically because you come from a university educated family and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Speaker 0>nobody ever thought it would be anything else than that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,47,94]}

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 0>You go to university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.140
<v Speaker 0>That's good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.350
<v Speaker 0>How many people are first generation university students?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, how many of you here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.910
<v Speaker 0>Because you really think computer science is interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.620
<v Speaker 0>I hope you're all being completely honest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.790
<v Speaker 0>And thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.510
<v Speaker 0>That's good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.980
<v Speaker 0>And how many of you are here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.920
<v Speaker 0>Because fundamentally, university is a place to put off the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.560

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.310
<v Speaker 0>doing so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.990
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.490
<v Speaker 0>I think that's a very good reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.930
<v Speaker 0>But let me emphasise actually university is about having fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Speaker 0>Some of the fun is learning, but there will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,60]}

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.350
<v Speaker 0>There are other sorts of fun, so don't let the

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.330
<v Speaker 0>the need to do the academic stuff get in the

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.050
<v Speaker 0>way of taking advantage of all the other things there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.640
<v Speaker 0>are in universities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.790
<v Speaker 0>Just don't take too much advantage of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that was a kind of general pep talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.950
<v Speaker 0>The other thing I wanted to say was something about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.330
<v Speaker 0>the marks on this course, because there was a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:56.810
<v Speaker 0>of.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.270
<v Speaker 0>Well-intentioned dishonesty in the introductory lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.020
<v Speaker 0>I don't showed you that graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.440
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.610
<v Speaker 0>And if you appreciate what we mean by it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.960
<v Speaker 0>So the point is that a first class result, which

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.230

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.070
<v Speaker 0>be excellent, not just a normal expectation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.120
<v Speaker 0>However, actually in reality the marks for this course look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.020
<v Speaker 0>like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay, that doesn't mean that you should consider it your

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.370
<v Speaker 0>aim to get 100% on the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.990
<v Speaker 0>As Don said, it's possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you want to aim for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 0>Just as something as a bit of fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 0>Do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 0>Nobody matters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 0>43 years ago, I lost one mark on my chemistry

<v Speaker 0>Multiple choice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 0>So don't worry about marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 0>If you do the work and have fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.930

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.040

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.710

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, so why is it 4 p.m. on Saturday rather

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,73,73,100,100,100]}

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.860

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, because students tell us that noon on Saturday is

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 0>not a meaningful time for most of them.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.020
<v Speaker 0>So we get hassle from the teaching office every year

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Speaker 0>about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.959
<v Speaker 0>And every year we do a poll of students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 0>So last year I did a poll of the class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 0>50% of the class responded, which is pretty good for

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.590
<v Speaker 0>a poll.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.240
<v Speaker 0>That's because I put it in one of the tutorial

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:43.500
<v Speaker 0>exercises, and 2% of students didn't like the 4 p.m.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,88]}

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.280

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 0>20% said it's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 0>Not brilliant, but fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 0>2% said they'd rather not in.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.750

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 0>it, I'm sorry, but you're in the very small minority,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.340
<v Speaker 0>so please don't make you go through this thing again.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 0>So let's start talking about some actual content computation and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 0>logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 0>What's the difference between computation and logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.230
<v Speaker 0>So computation we think of as stuff done by computers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.330
<v Speaker 0>But of course you also do computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 0>Once upon a time you were able to arithmetic by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 0>hand and in your heads.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.340
<v Speaker 0>Quite possibly you've forgotten how to do it by now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, but with a bit of luck you will learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.740
<v Speaker 0>it again, because I expect everybody to be able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.820
<v Speaker 0>do mental arithmetic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.790
<v Speaker 0>But what's logic?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100]}

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.970
<v Speaker 0>Anybody get taught logic in school?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.930
<v Speaker 0>A very small number of people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.130
<v Speaker 0>Which is a great pity because logic is useful in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.120
<v Speaker 0>many things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So logic is the language of reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.010
<v Speaker 0>And actually it's not easy to do reasoning about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.550
<v Speaker 0>real world that we live in for many reasons.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.360
<v Speaker 0>So one of those reasons is that the real world

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.440
<v Speaker 0>is not a hard edged place, even if we're simply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.380
<v Speaker 0>trying to talk about things, we have to give them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.510
<v Speaker 0>names and we have to put them into different classes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.320
<v Speaker 0>of object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.080
<v Speaker 0>And almost none of these categories are hard edged at

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.880

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.170
<v Speaker 0>Then they are.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.500
<v Speaker 0>But above that then most things become a bit hard

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 0>Well, again, there's a branch of logic called logics of

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.320

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.660

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so calculating the orbits of things, if you have

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.900

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.180
<v Speaker 0>If you have three, then it's no longer possible.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.360
<v Speaker 0>I mean we can do it numerically to an approximation,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.000

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.400
<v Speaker 0>So we have to do it by the same sort

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 0>or many other things, or some problems are simply so

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.650

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 0>An example of that is timetabling.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.390
<v Speaker 0>Last year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 0>When?

<v Speaker 0>Last year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 0>May.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.550
<v Speaker 0>Any advance on May.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,98,100,100]}

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.600
<v Speaker 0>September of the year before somebody is even more pessimistic.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.660
<v Speaker 0>So it starts in about March, which means we have

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.270

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 0>a right pain, because it means we can't have a

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.660

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.720
<v Speaker 0>And so when I first started here, I was introducing

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.410

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:45.600
<v Speaker 0>that has gone, um, so timetabling is actually an example

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.970
<v Speaker 0>of a problem that is provably very hard.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.520
<v Speaker 0>And the worst example of it is exams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.440
<v Speaker 0>So as you know, you don't have exams on this

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.390

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:03.030

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.200

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.520
<v Speaker 0>computational problem, which is why the exam timetabling also starts

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.540
<v Speaker 0>months early.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 0>Another thing that makes reasoning difficult is us people.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 0>People are very annoying because they're not rational.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 0>So how do you reason about what people are doing

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 0>even if they are rational?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 0>You have to understand what it is that they know

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.780
<v Speaker 0>or maybe what they believe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 0>So there are also branches of logic that are designed

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.440

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.410
<v Speaker 0>And yet again, we're not going to talk about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 0>So what are we going to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 0>We're going to be very, very simple minded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to think only about statements that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 0>So the point of today is to take the complexity

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 0>of the world and reduce it to something manageable for

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 0>the rest of the course, and also for much of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 0>the rest of your degrees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.510

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.000

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.920
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to make some simplifying assumptions about the

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>and computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.210
<v Speaker 0>And this is where we start introducing technical terms.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.850

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.880

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100]}

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.690
<v Speaker 0>This use of the word universe is peculiar to logic.

<v Speaker 0>It doesn't mean the whole world out there.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.740
<v Speaker 0>It means just a set of things.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:38.260

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.570
<v Speaker 0>Now we don't really care what the things are.

<v Speaker 0>If we have a set of cats and a set

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:51.820
<v Speaker 0>dogs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.770
<v Speaker 0>We just need ways to talk about them.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.570
<v Speaker 0>So we're just going to have names for things in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 0>So on the face of it, there are one, two,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.860

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 0>So if I give you a chess piece and ask

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, there are six possible answers and we don't like

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 0>six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Speaker 0>We only like two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.280
<v Speaker 0>So how do we take a question with six answers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.270
<v Speaker 0>and reduce it to a series of questions with two

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.020
<v Speaker 0>answers?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.290
<v Speaker 0>I say, as in the game 20 questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 0>I have always been surprised that not everybody knows that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.270
<v Speaker 0>So if I say the 20 questions game, how many

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.660

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 0>Two thirds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:21.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, so 20 questions is a game popular amongst children

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.880

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.990
<v Speaker 0>probably many others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.230
<v Speaker 0>So the idea is, I say I'm thinking of something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.410
<v Speaker 0>and you have to guess what it is by asking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.990

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.560
<v Speaker 0>no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.330
<v Speaker 0>And it's called 20 questions, because that's a reasonable number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.110
<v Speaker 0>in which to find out with good probability, but not

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.220
<v Speaker 0>too much probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.510
<v Speaker 0>What I'm thinking about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 0>And of course, in the real game my object is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.450
<v Speaker 0>to think of something that is very ambiguous, so that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.880
<v Speaker 0>you will find it very hard to pin down exactly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.960
<v Speaker 0>what I'm thinking of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.490
<v Speaker 0>But we're not doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm going to introduce some questions that will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.620
<v Speaker 0>split these pieces into a series of yes no questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.710
<v Speaker 0>If you are a chess player, then they will probably

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.470
<v Speaker 0>seem almost quite, almost natural.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.180
<v Speaker 0>Not quite, because I'm cheating a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.000
<v Speaker 0>If you are not a chess player, then you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.640
<v Speaker 0>like to go away after this and think about if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.100
<v Speaker 0>you were designing a series of questions along the lines

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.030
<v Speaker 0>that I'm about to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.610
<v Speaker 0>What questions would you ask if you don't know anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 0>about chess and don't care because there are other questions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.320
<v Speaker 0>you could ask.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 0>So in chess, the most important distinction is between these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 0>very weak pieces and the other pieces, which are much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:45.640
<v Speaker 0>stronger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.720
<v Speaker 0>So a natural first question is, is your piece a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61]}

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 0>pawn or is it not a pawn?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.980
<v Speaker 0>So if you get the answer, it's a yes, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 0>a pawn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 0>Then you're done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.170
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, we have to go on and try to distinguish

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 0>these pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 0>So then my next question out of 20 for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 0>chess player might be is it a major piece or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 0>a minor piece.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 0>So these pieces are moderately powerful in chess.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.700
<v Speaker 0>And these pieces, except this one, are very powerful in

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 0>chess.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.940
<v Speaker 0>For a chess player, the king is actually a weak

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 0>piece.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.200
<v Speaker 0>It's the most important piece because if it's captured, you've

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 0>lost.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 0>But it doesn't have very much offensive power of its

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.280
<v Speaker 0>own.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 0>It's the kind of king that hides in a bunker

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:40.900

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.890
<v Speaker 0>the real fighting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, So we could say, let's ask, is your peace

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.880
<v Speaker 0>of mind a peace or a major peace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.710
<v Speaker 0>If it's a minor peace, we've narrowed it down to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.480

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 0>So we simply ask, is it a knight?

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.770

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.030
<v Speaker 0>If it's a major peace, then we can break it

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.720
<v Speaker 0>down further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 0>We could say, for example, is it a rook or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,95]}

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.900
<v Speaker 0>sometimes called a castle, which is why it looks like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.530
<v Speaker 0>a castle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.980
<v Speaker 0>Or is it one of the royal pieces, King or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.520
<v Speaker 0>queen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.250
<v Speaker 0>If we get the answer yes, it's major.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.510
<v Speaker 0>Then we're done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.740
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, we have to break it down further in order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.230
<v Speaker 0>to separate the king and the queen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.160
<v Speaker 0>So we've got a series of questions for questions with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 0>yes no answers, and we can put them in what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.020
<v Speaker 0>we call a decision tree like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.330
<v Speaker 0>So each circle is a question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.030
<v Speaker 0>And then the way I've designed this, the yes answer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.870
<v Speaker 0>goes to the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.420
<v Speaker 0>So I'm saying here, is it not a pawn?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.760
<v Speaker 0>And if the answer is yes, that means it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.120
<v Speaker 0>a pawn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.280
<v Speaker 0>And I go to the right and I say, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.090
<v Speaker 0>it major?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.130
<v Speaker 0>If the answer is yes, I go to the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.110
<v Speaker 0>And then I say, is it royal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.270
<v Speaker 0>And if it's yes, I have to ask, is it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.870
<v Speaker 0>a king?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.610
<v Speaker 0>So the decision tree is a way of laying out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:13.980
<v Speaker 0>a series of questions together with their answers, so that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.160
<v Speaker 0>you can classify any piece.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.320
<v Speaker 0>Any questions about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.520
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to come back to this next time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.270
<v Speaker 0>as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.210
<v Speaker 0>Is the concept clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.060
<v Speaker 0>Just a simple graphical way of laying out a tree

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.870
<v Speaker 0>of questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.480
<v Speaker 0>So if you were actually playing 20 questions, you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.890
<v Speaker 0>even want to think this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 0>Now there's something worth noting about this tree.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 0>What it does is to give us a numerical label

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 0>to every piece.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 0>So if I look at the pawn, I can identify

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 0>it by.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 0>I got the answer zero to the first question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:55.010 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 0>If I look at the bishop, I can identifying it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 0>identify it by saying I got the answer one, followed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.660
<v Speaker 0>by the answer zero, followed by the answer zero or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.100
<v Speaker 0>false or whatever you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 0>So what this is doing is giving us an encoding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.490
<v Speaker 0>into binary digits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 0>For each of the pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 0>The pawn is zero, the bishop is 100, knight is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 0>one, zero one, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.290
<v Speaker 0>And the king is 1111.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 0>So notice that this is a variable length encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 0>As we say, some pieces have a short encoding, some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 0>have longer encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.420
<v Speaker 3>How many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 0>Bits?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 0>So each of these digits is a binary digit 0

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 0>or 1?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 0>We call it a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,68]}

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 0>How many bits do I need to describe the sets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 0>for different kinds of chess pieces?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 0>So I've used up to four here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.420
<v Speaker 0>Do I actually need four?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 0>If you think about how many questions this has taken.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 0>When I ask this question, I start with 16 possible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.690
<v Speaker 0>pieces, and I break it down into eight pawns or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.720
<v Speaker 0>eight major pieces, and I break it down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 0>How many questions do I have to answer?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 0>If you look at every type of piece and every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 0>piece in the chessboard and ask what they are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 0>It takes me 34 questions in total, which is quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 0>a large number, and that number is the number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 0>bits in the encoding that we use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 0>So if we had a complete chess set represented in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:55.460
<v Speaker 0>a computer program by these numerical names for them, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 0>we would have 34 bits worth of storage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 0>Would we care?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 0>Well that depends a bit on the application.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.630
<v Speaker 0>So you've grown up in a world where storage is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 0>essentially free.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 0>A very, very long time ago, storage was a very

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 0>tight resource.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 0>And there are circumstances in which you might care, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 0>we're not going to be going that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.560
<v Speaker 0>So we might wonder, is this the best way to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.160
<v Speaker 0>do it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 0>Do you think it's sensible to have a variable length

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 0>encoding, where some pieces have a label that is one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.000
<v Speaker 0>digit and some have a label that is four?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.660
<v Speaker 0>Would it be just easier if they all had the

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.560
<v Speaker 0>same length?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.950
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it would be easier in some ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.110
<v Speaker 0>It might not be a good reason, but yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.150
<v Speaker 0>So here's another encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.640
<v Speaker 0>Here I've decided to give everything a three bit encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.250
<v Speaker 0>Now ideally I would now stop for ten minutes and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.560
<v Speaker 0>ask you to work out what questions have I asked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.720
<v Speaker 0>in order to produce that encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.940
<v Speaker 0>But we don't have time for that in any way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.590
<v Speaker 0>Making you do things in lectures is mean because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.570
<v Speaker 0>can't think when people are staring at me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.680
<v Speaker 0>Some of you might not like it too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.550
<v Speaker 0>If you go away and think about it, if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.790
<v Speaker 0>could come up with various possibilities, one thing you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.040
<v Speaker 0>like to do after this lecture is to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.150
<v Speaker 0>other possibilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.590
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to show you one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.940
<v Speaker 0>But are there others?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:39.520
<v Speaker 0>So that's the tree that corresponds to this encoding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.290
<v Speaker 0>And those of the questions that I've asked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.900
<v Speaker 0>So I'm using the same questions, but I'm asking them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.040
<v Speaker 0>in a different order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.300
<v Speaker 0>So I'm asking major.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:52.900
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100]}

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.980
<v Speaker 0>That's not the same question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm separating Bishop and King.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.670
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.110
<v Speaker 0>So it is the same questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.570
<v Speaker 0>So the same questions in a different order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:07.180
<v Speaker 0>But there are some dummy questions that don't really apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.520
<v Speaker 0>So if I go back to this tree here, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.450
<v Speaker 0>you look at 011, there is no piece that has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.790
<v Speaker 0>the encoding 011 in my list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.330
<v Speaker 0>So I've left some stuff blank in the decision tree,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.330
<v Speaker 0>which means over here I don't have an answer to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:22.720
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.090
<v Speaker 0>That's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.640
<v Speaker 0>It just means it's a kind of chess piece that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.980
<v Speaker 0>doesn't exist, which means I'm never going to talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.780
<v Speaker 0>it, and it might simply be more convenient to have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.110
<v Speaker 0>three bits per piece, rather than something in between 3

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 0>and 4.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.880
<v Speaker 0>How many bits do I need?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 0>I showed you something that had 1 to 4.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96,96]}

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 0>I showed you something with three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 0>If I have six different types of chess piece, what's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.470
<v Speaker 0>the absolute minimum number of bits I need?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 0>Why three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99]}

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.070
<v Speaker 0>Let me go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.220
<v Speaker 0>So people at the back, I expect you to pipe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.120
<v Speaker 0>up as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 0>Where does three come from?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Log base.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Two of six together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,77,94,37]}

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Six possible pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,95]}

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 4>And then you round it up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,52,82]}

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:34.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, Because the hint is on the slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:39.540
<v Speaker 0>So if I give you four bits, that's four binary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 0>digits which have 16 two to the four possible values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.600
<v Speaker 0>So if I gave you two bits, you would have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.940
<v Speaker 0>four possible values 00011011.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.110
<v Speaker 0>And that's not enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.820
<v Speaker 0>So we need three bits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.520
<v Speaker 0>And then we have a couple of codes left over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:02.010
<v Speaker 0>Um and so you just go back and forward with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.230
<v Speaker 0>log and exponent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:12.030
<v Speaker 0>Um do notice this side bar here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78,78,100]}

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.260
<v Speaker 0>So I put various things in the sidebars of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:16.740
<v Speaker 0>slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.510
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes they're just for fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.480
<v Speaker 0>If they're written in green, they're not just for fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.100
<v Speaker 0>They're part of the slide that I want you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.150
<v Speaker 0>pay attention to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you will find that computer scientists use logarithms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.690
<v Speaker 0>quite a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.080
<v Speaker 0>But we don't like real numbers, so we never deal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.660
<v Speaker 0>with natural logarithms, at least in my bit of computer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.320
<v Speaker 0>science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.050
<v Speaker 0>And we also don't like the number ten, so we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.820
<v Speaker 0>don't deal with the kind of logs that you did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.540
<v Speaker 0>at school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.480
<v Speaker 0>So all our logs are logged to the base two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.230
<v Speaker 0>And so in computer science it's pretty standard that if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,67,100]}

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.020
<v Speaker 0>we write log we mean log to the base ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 0>As in school, if we write ln we mean log

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.510
<v Speaker 0>to the base E as in school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.240
<v Speaker 0>And if we write log we mean log to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.330
<v Speaker 0>base two, which is what you're going to be used

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 0>to for the rest of your degree here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.450
<v Speaker 0>If by any chance you have forgotten the laws of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.320
<v Speaker 0>logs since you were last examined on them, please make

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.660
<v Speaker 0>sure they are firmly back in your brain, because I'm

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 0>going to assume you can do them without thinking along

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.790
<v Speaker 0>with many other things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.130
<v Speaker 0>And we are just approaching time, which is good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.880
<v Speaker 0>So please bear in mind that after this class there

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.720
<v Speaker 0>is another large class, so I can't take questions after

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 0>the lecture in here after this class.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 0>So I can and also please go out that door.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:43.690

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.490
<v Speaker 0>I'll hang around outside if you want to ask questions.
