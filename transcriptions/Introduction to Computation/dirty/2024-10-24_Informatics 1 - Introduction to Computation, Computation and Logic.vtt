00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, the lectures are a little shuffled because there is

<v Speaker 0>Oh well, it should be fun or interesting.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 0>So today we'll finish off what is normally week six.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.940

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 0>And these were this engineer's way of identifying a concise

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 0>formula that describes a particular truth table, if you will,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 0>or part of a universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 0>And we ended up discussing a few techniques.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 0>We ended up discussing a few techniques for making them

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 0>short, which included things like looking for the rectangles that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.290

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 0>for rectangles that overlap and therefore save you one variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 0>Anybody have any questions about all that stuff?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 0>Are you comfortable that you can go and do it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 0>It's pretty easy, so I hope you are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 0>It's really nice if you get it perfectly right, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 0>your tutorials are so much easier to mark when they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 0>all correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 0>And this one of course is not easy to auto

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 0>mark.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 0>So like most of the CL tutorials, the tutors actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 0>have to look at it and what they will do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 0>is pattern match against the sample answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 0>So if you can get the sample answers something similar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 0>to that, that's great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 0>But in many of the cases there may be 1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 0>or 2 different possible correct answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 0>And then the tutors have to think which they don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 0>like, but it's good for them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 0>So what have we been doing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 0>If you look at the formulae we've been producing through

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 0>the whole string of exercises, they have something in common.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 0>They all have the property that they are taking, a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.030
<v Speaker 0>So there's the union, the or, and the even rectangle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.200
<v Speaker 0>is being described by filtering it down by which rows

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 0>and columns it's true at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100]}

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 0>So each rectangle is described by an and of things,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 0>sometimes positive things and sometimes negative things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 0>And then we are oring together a bunch of rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 0>This is a type of formula, a way of representing

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 0>formulae, which turns out to be very useful in many

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 0>ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 0>So they are all ORS of ands, and the technical

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 0>Why is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 0>How many of you know what a normal form means?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 0>So normally this is a mathematician use of the word

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 0>You will see a lot of normal forms.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, you are doing linear algebra at the moment.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 0>Have you not had any normal forms for matrices yet?

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.700
<v Speaker 0>Are you expecting to get normal forms?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 0>I think you probably will later in linear algebra, or

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.470

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, a normal form means a particular form of matrix

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.730

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 0>So it has a particular pattern it has to match.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.210

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, for example, if you're looking at matrices, there are

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 0>normal form to mean putting it into a particular shape

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 0>that is easy to deal with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 0>In some ways, it's not the case that a particular

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 0>normal form is always the best way to describe a

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 0>formula in every situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 0>We'll see that in some cases, some normal forms are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 0>better than others, but there are many applications where you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 0>want to massage the formula into a shape that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 0>nice to deal with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 0>So this is disjunctive normal form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 0>I have always found this hard to remember its disjunctive

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 0>normal form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 0>It's disjunctive because the outermost combinator is an or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 0>We'll building an all of an and or is disjunction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,55,100,100,99,100,100,100,97]}

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 0>So this is called disjunctive normal form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.830
<v Speaker 0>If you want to put it in more mathematical, traditional

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 0>notation, you can say that formally we have some formula

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 0>is in DNF.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 0>If it has a bunch of what we call literals.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.700
<v Speaker 0>So these are either variables or negated variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 0>Um so I've got that wrong haven't I?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,81,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 0>A literal is a boolean variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 0>And we allow literals or negated literals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 0>We take an and of those and then each of

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 0>those gives us an and and then we build up

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.620
<v Speaker 0>an or so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100]}

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.020
<v Speaker 0>These are the rectangles and this is the union of

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.720
<v Speaker 0>the rectangles in your formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 0>So any questions about this as a definition of notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 0>Is everybody now completely happy with the use of big

<v Speaker 0>V and big wedge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 0>A multi-way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,84]}

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 0>And just like the sum notation, I index over whatever

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 0>is convenient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 0>So I'm indexing over j goes from one to however

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 0>many things I have in each clause.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:04.920
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.840
<v Speaker 0>Is anybody pedantic enough to notice an error in this

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.680
<v Speaker 0>definition?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.340
<v Speaker 0>To do with the indexes.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.500
<v Speaker 0>Index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.790
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's because I'm intentionally not saying what the

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.870

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 0>I can make it range over anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.110
<v Speaker 0>A bit more subtle than that.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:41.219
<v Speaker 1>That equals two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,69]}

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:44.010

<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 0>So that's not the case because I've written Ige in

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, some people like to put commas between indexes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.120
<v Speaker 0>I don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.850
<v Speaker 0>So, um, applied mathematicians tend not to put commas between

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.230

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95]}

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.950
<v Speaker 0>Does my definition of DNF say that all these ans

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 0>bit debateable really, given how sloppy I'm being, but kind

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.890

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.500

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 0>different I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56]}

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.660
<v Speaker 0>So P one might have J going from 0 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.800

<v Speaker 0>a and b and D.

<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you might see a truth table or part of

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.570
<v Speaker 0>it's easier for you as a human to look at

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.970
<v Speaker 0>the places where the thing is zero, rather than where

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 0>the thing is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.100
<v Speaker 0>So here is a map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, if we do what we've done so far, what

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.710
<v Speaker 0>is the right way?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.640
<v Speaker 0>What is the correct cono map description to pull out?

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.730
<v Speaker 0>So think about that for a minute or two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.790
<v Speaker 0>I shouldn't need to think too hard about this because

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.000
<v Speaker 0>this is about human intuition, but remembering some of the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.970
<v Speaker 0>slightly odd things that we've done in getting here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, so how many rectangles do you find when you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.510
<v Speaker 0>do what we've done so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.420
<v Speaker 0>Who has four or more?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.550
<v Speaker 0>Who has three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Speaker 0>Who has two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.110
<v Speaker 0>Who has one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73]}

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.990
<v Speaker 0>So I think that if we do what we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.240
<v Speaker 0>before, we will get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.900
<v Speaker 0>So this is using both of the slightly tricky features

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.290
<v Speaker 0>that we've done before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.680
<v Speaker 0>Firstly remembering that this thing is on a Taurus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 0>So the rows wrap round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,55]}

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.160
<v Speaker 0>So the pink area is just described by one rectangle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.740
<v Speaker 0>where b is false, and the green area is described

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.440
<v Speaker 0>by one rectangle where d is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.670
<v Speaker 0>And it's also taking advantage of overlapping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.940
<v Speaker 0>We can overlap the corners which lets us break it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:37.430
<v Speaker 0>down into just two rectangles, each of which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.750
<v Speaker 0>nice big rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 0>Each of these rectangles covers half the grid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 0>So we have a very short formula describing it not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Speaker 0>be or not D, which is perhaps not totally obvious,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.360
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.640
<v Speaker 0>It certainly wasn't totally obvious to me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.340
<v Speaker 0>So those of you with two rectangles presumably got that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.260
<v Speaker 0>because I think that's the only way to do it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.640
<v Speaker 0>with two rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.280
<v Speaker 0>If you had 3 or 4, then you weren't being

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 0>quite efficient enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.570
<v Speaker 0>However, if I look at that thing, let's forget the

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.440
<v Speaker 0>rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.220
<v Speaker 0>What's the pattern that obviously stands out to us as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.000
<v Speaker 0>humans?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.580
<v Speaker 0>What we see at first sight, or at least what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.220
<v Speaker 0>I see at first sight, is the square of zeros

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.620
<v Speaker 0>in the middle, which is one rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.640
<v Speaker 0>So why can't I describe it by one rectangle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.900
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's because it's zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.910
<v Speaker 0>It's not one, But surely we shouldn't be hung up

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.770
<v Speaker 0>on whether things are true or false or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 0>We're just trying to describe the universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.190
<v Speaker 0>So if we look at the zeros, if we describe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.480
<v Speaker 0>the zero rectangle, this pink thing, then doing what we

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 0>did before that is b and d, is that right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.080
<v Speaker 0>B d is true here, D is true here, B

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.790

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.110
<v Speaker 0>So the pink rectangle is described by b and d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.010
<v Speaker 0>And therefore we can say that the universe is described

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.670

<v Speaker 0>The Morgan.

<v Speaker 0>Okay, I told you some weeks ago that you need

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.380
<v Speaker 0>to have the Morgan in your head and ready to

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.730
<v Speaker 0>apply instantly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.570
<v Speaker 0>So if I do the Morgan to this, I get.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.300

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:23.720

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.500
<v Speaker 0>which is talking about positives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, before I do a more complex example, any questions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.770
<v Speaker 0>about this example?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.830
<v Speaker 0>So here's a more complex example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is another thing which has lots of ones

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.530
<v Speaker 0>in a rather unhelpfully scattered way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.120
<v Speaker 0>So we'll do the same little exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.740
<v Speaker 0>So take a moment to analyse that as we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 0>last week, and see how many distinct rectangles you end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.970
<v Speaker 0>up using to describe that by looking at the ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 0>So again, who has four or more rectangles?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 0>Who has three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 0>Who has two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,99]}

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, would you like to say how you got to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Aha.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 0>So these and those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 0>Now that doesn't count for us because it's not an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 0>even rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.990
<v Speaker 0>It has length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 0>Side length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.250
<v Speaker 0>Three rectangles have to have side length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.870
<v Speaker 0>That is a power of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 0>So 248 because that's the only way we can describe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.340
<v Speaker 0>them in terms of variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:00.690
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.910
<v Speaker 0>So this is what I believe is the most efficient

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.780
<v Speaker 0>way to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.520
<v Speaker 0>We take the centre thing, take this square and this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.130
<v Speaker 0>square, and again we do the overlapping technique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.980
<v Speaker 0>And then that gives us a couple of squares which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.230
<v Speaker 0>are described by two variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.630
<v Speaker 0>And actually they're nice symmetrical things because this is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.130
<v Speaker 0>nice symmetrical diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.170
<v Speaker 0>And the central area is where B is won.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,41]}

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, but that was a bit of work, and on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.960
<v Speaker 0>the face of it, it's much easier to look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.190
<v Speaker 0>this thing as a bunch of zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.090
<v Speaker 0>So if I look at it as zeros, then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:58.280
<v Speaker 0>just see the two simple rectangles here, and I end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.260
<v Speaker 0>up with a formula that looks like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.330
<v Speaker 0>Now this is where life is getting a bit complicated,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.690
<v Speaker 0>because what I have here is something that is definitely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.590
<v Speaker 0>not in disjunctive normal form, because it's a negation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 0>If I do the Morgan on this, am I going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 0>to get a formula in DNF?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 0>When I do to Morgan.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,97]}

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 0>What happens?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.250
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't internalised the Morgan yet, then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,93,84,100,100]}

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.700
<v Speaker 0>Go back and think about what happens if I take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.640
<v Speaker 0>a negation and do the Morgan on it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,85,100,100,100]}

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.140
<v Speaker 0>What does the Morgan say to Morgan?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.480
<v Speaker 0>Says the not of the or is the end of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.520
<v Speaker 0>the nots and the not of the and is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.720
<v Speaker 0>not of the ORS.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,43]}

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.160
<v Speaker 0>What that ultimately means is if you take this negation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160
<v Speaker 0>and you do Morgan all the way inside, what you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.210
<v Speaker 0>end up doing is simply changing Ands into ORS and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:08.130
<v Speaker 0>vice versa, and changing the negation of the inside things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.850
<v Speaker 0>So if I have the Morgan internally in my head,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.440
<v Speaker 0>I can simply say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.880
<v Speaker 0>It looks like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.370
<v Speaker 0>And I did not do that by laboriously applying to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.830
<v Speaker 0>Morgan twice to the outside and the inside.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.460
<v Speaker 0>I just used the shortcut of saying if I negate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.820
<v Speaker 0>something and push all the negations inward using the Morgan

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.350
<v Speaker 0>High chain exchange, and ignore and flip the polarity of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.980
<v Speaker 0>all the literals here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.710
<v Speaker 0>If they were positive, they become negative and vice versa.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:03.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what I've now got is something that has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.620
<v Speaker 0>an and on the outside I don't need these anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:16.860
<v Speaker 0>And the and is joining together two formulae that have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.000
<v Speaker 0>alls in them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100]}

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 0>That's not what we wanted for disjunctive normal form, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 0>it looks kind of similar, but opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 0>Do you think there might be a name for this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it might possibly be conjunctive normal form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 0>So disjunctive normal form is the and or of ands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,68]}

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 0>And conjunctive normal form is an and of ors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.510
<v Speaker 0>So we can do it like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.530
<v Speaker 0>And then what can we do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 0>How much am I going to say before I go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 0>on and say a little bit more about conjunctive normal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 0>form?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:10.340
<v Speaker 0>Then those of you who've been reading the book will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 0>have seen that the book treats examples like this differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 0>Has anybody noticed that I'm doing it differently from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 0>book?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.660
<v Speaker 0>If you read what the book says.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.370
<v Speaker 0>The book does this in using that magic word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.400
<v Speaker 0>Again, the dual way to what we did last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.010
<v Speaker 0>So when we were looking at things, looking at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.970
<v Speaker 0>ones in a corner map, we looked for rectangles, even

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.330
<v Speaker 0>to find all the ones in the diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.350
<v Speaker 0>The book says that if you're looking at a table

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.020
<v Speaker 0>and you're trying to find the zeros and describe them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,98,100]}

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:59.290
<v Speaker 0>by rectangles, you should be looking for intersecting rectangles that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.970
<v Speaker 0>cover all the zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.310
<v Speaker 0>I've tried.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.900
<v Speaker 0>I simply cannot do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.160
<v Speaker 0>My head will not let me calculate with intersecting rectangles

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.410
<v Speaker 0>on a diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.040
<v Speaker 0>And I suspect I'm probably not the only person who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.390
<v Speaker 0>finds that difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.740
<v Speaker 0>So for me, it's much easier to do it this

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Speaker 0>way to build up the zeros, as in the same

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 0>way that we did for ones as a union of

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 0>rectangles, and then say, we're taking the negation of that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 0>and then just apply the negation using the Morgan, which

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.930

<v Speaker 0>If you read the book and you find that your

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 0>Because I tutored this course for a couple of years

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.570

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.060

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.100

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.240

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 0>it that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Um, why are we so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,93,95,100]}

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.220
<v Speaker 0>I've just shown you a formula in conjunctive normal form,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 0>which is the obvious opposite of DNF.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 0>Suppose I take a formula in DNF and I negate

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 0>it then, as I showed you just now, completely automatically

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 0>the negation is easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 0>So if I take an Or of ans of something,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 0>the not of an or of ans and something is

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.800

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.860

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.800

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 0>So who thinks that's obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100]}

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34]}

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:38.210
<v Speaker 0>So if maybe anybody think it's so completely unobvious that

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.710

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.660

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:55.790

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.580
<v Speaker 0>any formula can be turned into DNF, how would you

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.300
<v Speaker 0>it mathematically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.970
<v Speaker 0>But this is not just a course about logic.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.750

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.460

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.020

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.880

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 0>any formula into DNF, would that be significantly less intimidating?

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 0>Haskell, you do recursive functions which break things down and

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 0>If I give you some random formula in DNF and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.760

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 0>So I still can't hear two to the n exponential

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 0>growth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 0>Genuine exponential growth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 0>Um any other ideas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:19.780
<v Speaker 0>So exponential growth is the right answer.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.790

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.730
<v Speaker 0>and it's in DNF and you convert it to CNF,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.040
<v Speaker 0>you might end up with a formula that has two

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.450
<v Speaker 0>Is this bad news?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:40.899
<v Speaker 0>So for the kind of formulae we deal with, they

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:45.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.399
<v Speaker 0>So even for that two to the n is not

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:54.970

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.260
<v Speaker 0>However, where is all this stuff actually used?

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:04.960

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.060
<v Speaker 0>And there the formulae might be thousands or tens of
