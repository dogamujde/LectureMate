00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.790

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 3>So hi, guys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about my exchange currently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>In this overview about CMU, um, called Carnegie Mellon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,43,62,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Which I only found out after I came here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Didn't realise that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.480
<v Speaker 3>And then the whole campus is very Scottish theme.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Our mascot is a Scottish terrier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.660
<v Speaker 3>And then there are people playing bagpipes on campus, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.200
<v Speaker 3>is very much a shock to me because I did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.010
<v Speaker 3>not expect that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 3>So, um, about its academic background, it's ranked number one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.460
<v Speaker 3>in computer science title MIT in the US.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,88]}

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's good for AI, cybersecurity, computer systems, programming languages,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.470
<v Speaker 3>and basically almost every computer science field.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 3>And the academic year is from August to May.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.100
<v Speaker 3>So during the start of the year, um, the freshmen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.320
<v Speaker 3>would like kind of make this whole CMU photo.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.750
<v Speaker 3>And then this is our statue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not very it's just a it's called walking towards

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.510
<v Speaker 3>the sky, I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.180
<v Speaker 3>And then this was actually last week when there was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 3>like Northern Lights, this was taken over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Or over the campus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[29,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.540
<v Speaker 2>You're you're, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,77]}

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.970
<v Speaker 3>So in general, I sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,93]}

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying the audio is not great, but carry

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.580
<v Speaker 2>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Um, do you need me to repeat anything?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 2>No, I think that's okay so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 1>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 3>For life in Pittsburgh, I'd say costs and accommodation wise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100]}

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Um, it's more expensive than Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Buying groceries is more expensive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:12.139
<v Speaker 3>Um, eating out is usually also more expensive because you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 3>have to tip.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't manage to get on campus housing because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 3>of a whole fiasco.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Like over registered there for years or something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,35,49,84,100,100]}

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 3>But I'd say for campus housing, they're all double rooms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.409
<v Speaker 3>So if you do manage to get, um, accommodation, you'd

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 3>have to share with a stranger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 3>And then for campus food, it's decent, but I would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.620
<v Speaker 3>not recommend buying meal blocks because you can actually buy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.440
<v Speaker 3>them for cheaper off the freshman or other people who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,88,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 3>bought too many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 3>And exchange blocks with other people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,93,93,100,100]}

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.889
<v Speaker 3>Far away from campus because the nearest Aldi was like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:56.110
<v Speaker 3>is 25 minutes walk away from for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.710
<v Speaker 3>And um, there's also a huge target, but then you'd

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.330
<v Speaker 3>have to take the bus to get there, so it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.850
<v Speaker 3>not very walkable in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Um, with our CMU student ID, you can get free

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.110
<v Speaker 3>bus just like the young Scot card.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.260
<v Speaker 3>But, um, it's also better to just be friends, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.170
<v Speaker 3>with someone with a car, because although the bus is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:18.340
<v Speaker 3>free, it doesn't come very, like, frequently or on time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.370
<v Speaker 3>So I'd recommend just befriending someone with the car and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100]}

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.300

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Um, so for things to do in Pittsburgh, there are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.370

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.330
<v Speaker 3>You have baseball.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.270
<v Speaker 3>The team in Pittsburgh is Pirates football, the team of

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.940

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a baseball game once, didn't really know

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.530
<v Speaker 3>what was going on, but it was worth the experience.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.470

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Something is right off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,63,54,89]}

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 3>And look at this table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 3>There's the Botanic Garden, and it's really pretty.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really near campus as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 3>You can just walk there and show them your ID

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 3>and they'll let you in for free.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.270

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.700

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 3>courses to choose from, like basically everything within C is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,92]}

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>that you can think of, there probably is a course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100]}

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 3>because, um, there are courses within and outside the School

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.480

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Um, apart from there's also like information that working institute,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,98]}

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 3>there's like cybersecurity institute, there's um electrical engineering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,51,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.370
<v Speaker 3>They all offer like CSE related courses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,100,100]}

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.460
<v Speaker 3>So there's just really a lot of courses to choose

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:46.910
<v Speaker 3>from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Um, and we can also take undergrad or post-grad courses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Adding on to the options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Um, there's also this really thing called student.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 3>And they're also usually really fun and really chill.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not one of the main courses that you would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.510
<v Speaker 3>take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.770
<v Speaker 3>It's something you add on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's a really interesting experience because the courses are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.750
<v Speaker 3>taught by students and they're all usually on a fun

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.350
<v Speaker 3>topic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Currently, I'm taking one on like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, so that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.010
<v Speaker 3>pretty fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Um, for my workload, I'd say it really depends on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 3>the course, but most of the undergrad CSE courses are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.290
<v Speaker 3>very intensive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Um, my friends are also doing like other CSE, like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.770
<v Speaker 3>postgrad courses, and there's still a lot of, like, projects

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.370
<v Speaker 3>to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh, for undergrad courses, it's roughly one homework per week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.700
<v Speaker 3>per course that take around like 6 to 8 hours

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.510
<v Speaker 3>to complete.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd say one homework is kind of like a coursework

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.720
<v Speaker 3>from, let's say, Iads or something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.930
<v Speaker 3>And then for each course, it varies by course obviously,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 3>but usually there are two midterms and one final.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.470
<v Speaker 3>And my my culture shock was like when there are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.420
<v Speaker 3>no assignment like there are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Completing the assignments and studying for the midterm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.010
<v Speaker 3>But office hours are basically, um, we have them in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,97,97,98,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Edinburgh too, but I think it's not as big as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.100
<v Speaker 3>a big other thing like here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.950
<v Speaker 3>People line up to go to office hours, and usually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a really long line, and people ask about homework

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.630
<v Speaker 3>or things about the courses that they don't understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a really big culture among them, and the Tas

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,100,100,100,89,97,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.860
<v Speaker 3>are also students, so it's a bonding experience, I guess.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.850
<v Speaker 3>So for research, you can contact professors and ask them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.920

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Um, so CMU offers independent study credits that you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.910
<v Speaker 3>take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to do research and you want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.430
<v Speaker 3>them to count towards your degree, you can speak with

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.350
<v Speaker 3>the academic advisor, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88]}

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.360
<v Speaker 3>And then you can turn that into a course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Um, it's easier to just, um, reach out to a

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.880
<v Speaker 3>professor that you're taking a course in, because usually if

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.580
<v Speaker 3>you just call the email, they won't respond because they

<v Speaker 3>to CMU.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:31.620

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.790

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100]}

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.530
<v Speaker 4>So Hong Kong was great for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:53.240

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh, Hong Kong is well known for its hiking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a really dense city, but actually there's a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 4>of hiking in nature around as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.670
<v Speaker 4>Just 20 minutes ferry can get you to really peaceful

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.750
<v Speaker 4>island getaways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.610
<v Speaker 4>Um, so it can be a very bustling city, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.680
<v Speaker 4>it's also lots of nature around as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.300
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the parks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.160

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Um, so for accommodation, I would say, um, University accommodation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 4>is definitely recommended.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I'll see if I can move the.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 7>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Um, so, uh, yeah, I would say it's very difficult

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.290

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.600

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.190

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.550

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I think this is also a good point to mention

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.740

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.530

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.480

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.390

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.900

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Um, I found because we, uh, courses are a bit

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.650

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.260

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Normal students are supposed to take 1 to 2 Common

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:40.990
<v Speaker 4>Core courses each year, which is like courses that anyone

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.100

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.830
<v Speaker 4>a bit less intense than the higher level CS courses.

00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:49.690
<v Speaker 4>So I did one of those as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Um, which was quite interesting, went a bit deeper in

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.320
<v Speaker 4>So I found that quite fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Um, most of the CSE courses I was on had

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.410

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 4>a bit more than I'm used to here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.560

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I would recommend also waking up for that, because some

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.870

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:20.190

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 4>You can have them already in your basket before the

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.320
<v Speaker 4>opens, and if you put that in as soon as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.030
<v Speaker 4>it opens, that's your best chance to get the course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.660
<v Speaker 4>you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.870
<v Speaker 4>But the normal students are still prioritised above the exchange

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.600

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.860

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.650
<v Speaker 4>pretty good choices, so that was fine for me, I

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:37.980
<v Speaker 4>think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not as intense as some of the other places

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.510
<v Speaker 4>I would also say there's a lot of international students

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.380
<v Speaker 4>at HKU.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.570
<v Speaker 4>It's well known for being very international.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.270
<v Speaker 4>It can be a bit harder to make friends with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.330
<v Speaker 4>local students if you don't speak any Cantonese.

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:56.310
<v Speaker 4>But in general, there's lots of international students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a huge amount of exchange students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Um, there were, I think 15 exchange students from Edinburgh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.790

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100,66,100,100,100]}

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Um, and I made friends with some of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.170
<v Speaker 4>I think we try not to stick together too much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:10.880
<v Speaker 4>because you don't leave at home or just make friends

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,57,41,92,100,100,100]}

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.880
<v Speaker 4>with only Adam or people, but, um, it's very fun.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.280
<v Speaker 4>Like a huge, like, group people to hang out with,

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.140
<v Speaker 4>um, costs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.200
<v Speaker 4>So one thing I haven't mentioned here, actually, is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.790
<v Speaker 4>I am a, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:25.160
<v Speaker 4>It depends what kind of fee paying student you are,

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.860
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a rest of UK like English fee paying

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:31.640

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.330
<v Speaker 4>exchange.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.090
<v Speaker 4>So instead of paying 9000 something, I only paid 4000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.580
<v Speaker 4>something, which also adds into how much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.800
<v Speaker 4>And I think you can get slightly more maintenance loan

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.450

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:45.050
<v Speaker 4>Um, the flights were obviously the one like big one

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Um, that is quite expensive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.050
<v Speaker 4>If you you're going to have to try and wait

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:52.640

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.870
<v Speaker 4>But as long as you can do it will save

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,66,87,100,99,73,63,100,100]}

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Um, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.390
<v Speaker 2>This is being very sluggish.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's you okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,31,85,98]}

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:12.700
<v Speaker 8>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.030
<v Speaker 8>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:13.300
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:13.690
<v Speaker 9>Hi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:14.560
<v Speaker 9>My name is Selena.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54]}

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.440
<v Speaker 9>I went to the University of Pennsylvania last year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.740
<v Speaker 9>Um, so my presentation is quite short, so I'm just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.600
<v Speaker 9>going to go over some of the key points, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.690
<v Speaker 9>like my motivations for going and some of the things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.220
<v Speaker 9>I wish I knew before going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.080
<v Speaker 9>Um, so, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.330
<v Speaker 9>Why the University of Pennsylvania?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,90,100,100,100]}

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:34.450
<v Speaker 9>So, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:38.200
<v Speaker 9>So my main reason for going was that academic reasons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.560
<v Speaker 9>So University of Pennsylvania has a wide range of courses

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.520
<v Speaker 9>you can choose from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:46.300
<v Speaker 9>Um, one of the things that was particularly, um, appealing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.970
<v Speaker 9>to me was that the the idea that you could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:50.460
<v Speaker 9>take courses at a higher level.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.180
<v Speaker 9>So it was quite flexible to choose courses that were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 9>postgraduate or upper undergraduate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,47,100]}

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 9>The requirements are quite flexible as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 9>Um, so you can email the professor explaining, say that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 9>you have these requirements from the University of Edinburgh and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.240
<v Speaker 9>how they translate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 9>And generally it's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 9>There are a couple of courses which have more stricter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.720
<v Speaker 9>requirements, but that's on a case by case basis and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.360
<v Speaker 9>those are generally more specialised, specialised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,39,60]}

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 9>Um, so generally um it's expected that you take four

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 9>courses per semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 9>So this is equivalent to fourth course units.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.070
<v Speaker 9>You have a maximum of 5.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.460
<v Speaker 9>But it's generally not recommended to take 5.5 units worth

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 9>of courses, as these courses are a lot more intense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.500
<v Speaker 9>than the ones from this university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.880
<v Speaker 9>Um, so the courses are on the first come, first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 9>serve basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100]}

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 9>So before you arrive at the University of Pennsylvania, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.610
<v Speaker 9>need to manually apply yourself for these courses through their

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:52.100
<v Speaker 9>application portal called Penn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,45]}

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.690
<v Speaker 9>Um, what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.810
<v Speaker 9>One thing I wish I knew before going is that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:00.470
<v Speaker 9>um, we do not get access to advanced registration before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100]}

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.830
<v Speaker 9>for the first semester, so most of the other students

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:05.960
<v Speaker 9>for the first semester would have already registered.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.440
<v Speaker 9>So it's a lot more, um, intensive, you know, sign

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,98,100,100,100]}

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.570
<v Speaker 9>on for your the courses you're interested in for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:12.470
<v Speaker 9>first semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:15.440
<v Speaker 9>But it generally worked out fine because you have two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.560
<v Speaker 9>weeks at the start of the semester to change courses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.200
<v Speaker 9>Um, it's there add drop or swap period.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.220
<v Speaker 9>Um, one other good thing about University of Pennsylvania is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.360
<v Speaker 9>that it really enables you to, um, study courses outside

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.920
<v Speaker 9>of the scope of computer science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.080
<v Speaker 9>So I know a lot of people in the past

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.620
<v Speaker 9>have studied, um, taking courses from the business school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.130
<v Speaker 9>So Wharton School of Business, which is quite famous, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:43.760
<v Speaker 9>personally went and took a couple of computational biology courses,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 9>um, which I had an interest in at the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 9>So one of the reasons I highly recommend going on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:54.100
<v Speaker 9>a stage in the University of Pennsylvania is it really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 9>provides you with a different perspectives perspective on learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.450
<v Speaker 9>So I found that the courses were extremely well taught

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 9>and emphasised engagement from the students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 9>So there were a lot more interactive office hours and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.130
<v Speaker 9>recitations in order to ensure that you actually know the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 9>content.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:16.750
<v Speaker 9>The assignments were also a lot more intensive, so I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 9>think I had either weekly or bi weekly assignments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,55,100]}

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 9>So often you have multiple up to 3 to 4

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 9>deadlines in a week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 9>You also have midterms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 9>And these assignments are normally built up built on each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,41,100,100,100]}

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:30.370
<v Speaker 9>other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:34.210
<v Speaker 9>So at the end you get something that is, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 9>very applicable and you can put on your CV.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.930
<v Speaker 9>Um, one thing to note is that UPenn puts a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 9>lot of emphasis on group assignments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.660
<v Speaker 9>So if you really don't like working in a group,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.490
<v Speaker 9>it might not be something for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 9>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:53.220
<v Speaker 9>So besides academic reasons, um, I also had some personal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100,100,98,100,100]}

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.890
<v Speaker 9>reasons for travelling from going on exchange.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.100
<v Speaker 9>So these involved getting to new to know a new

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.160
<v Speaker 9>culture, um, travel and the social aspect of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.690
<v Speaker 9>So yeah, travel.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.500
<v Speaker 9>So, um, the UPenn is located in Philadelphia, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.850
<v Speaker 9>one of the largest cities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.570
<v Speaker 9>Um, it has a really interesting culture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.300
<v Speaker 9>It's also about two hours away from New York, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.680
<v Speaker 9>I highly recommend visiting, and Washington, DC, which I regret

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 9>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.700

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.170
<v Speaker 9>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:59.069
<v Speaker 9>So accommodation, you it's mandatory for you to get accommodation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.140
<v Speaker 9>with the university itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.779
<v Speaker 9>Um, it is actually quite expensive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:06.720
<v Speaker 9>Um, so I think I paid around 12 K for

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.049
<v Speaker 9>mine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.259
<v Speaker 9>The higher limit is around 15 K.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.000
<v Speaker 9>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.420
<v Speaker 9>Generally these are in what they call apartment style.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.930
<v Speaker 9>So it's, um, you would generally be sharing a room

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:21.870

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.640
<v Speaker 9>and a shared bathroom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:09:24.089 --> 01:09:28.140
<v Speaker 9>Um, so most of these accommodations are quite old and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.390

01:09:32.549 --> 01:09:38.029
<v Speaker 9>a high rise, and, um, the facilities are a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.350

<v Speaker 9>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.000
<v Speaker 9>So if you are applying, I recommend doing a research

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.230

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:52.160

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:52.940
<v Speaker 9>what you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.460

<v Speaker 9>a shot.

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 9>Um, I generally recommend going for the least expensive one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.770

<v S11>Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.370

01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:32.040

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.150
<v S11>But in my second semester I did a 16 week

01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:39.270

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.940
<v S11>There's an entirely separate process for exchange students to undertake

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:51.930
<v S11>Um, you get a grade for it, you get mentorship,

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:53.700

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:56.760
<v S11>If you're interested in academia or CSE, research in, again,

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.820
<v S11>any field possible within the umbrella of CSE.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.640
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you could comment on the funding and what

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.550
<v Speaker 2>you know, what sort of proportion of your costs that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,97,100,100,100,83,94]}

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.970
<v Speaker 2>covered.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:11.780
<v S11>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:16.130
<v S11>So we both got access to the scholarship, um, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:18.620
<v S11>yes, and the Swiss Exchange mobility program.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,89]}

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.870
<v S11>And that gave us a yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:21.800
<v S11>No, 1900.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.330
<v S12>It was more than that, I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.470
<v S11>It was it was 19.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:28.310
<v S11>It was 1900 francs a semester, which helped basically with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:30.110
<v S11>both rent and lunch in my case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:32.150
<v S11>And the funny part about this is they pay out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,80]}

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:33.260
<v S11>the scholarship in cash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,87,100]}

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.400
<v S11>So you're going to have to figure out how to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.140
<v S11>get that cash into your bank account if you don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.570
<v S11>make a Swiss account, which I personally didn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.990
<v S11>But otherwise you have that avenue available to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.800
<v S11>Uh, beyond that, I would say my costs for Zurich

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:52.100
<v S11>were maybe 1.31.4 x compared to Edinburgh, but I know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.960
<v S11>I was spending more money in Edinburgh than I should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.320
<v S11>have been.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.910
<v S11>So again, grain of salt?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:58.250
<v Unknown>Um, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:02.030
<v Unknown>I was wondering what it's like, obviously, since.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,55,38,57,100,68]}

01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:07.930
<v S11>Um, so that so that really depends on the courses

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:08.530
<v S11>you take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.800
<v S11>Um, there is definitely a selection of courses where you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.260
<v S11>can do you can have a much easier time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:16.930
<v S11>Um, but for the most part I would take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,90]}

01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:19.810
<v S11>So I'm particular personally, I'm very interested in systems and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:23.050
<v S11>security, which something is not for around the world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:26.410
<v S11>So I was taking some particularly intense courses just because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:27.820
<v S11>I didn't know if I would have the chance to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:28.480
<v S11>do them again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.630
<v S11>So if that's your right, I would say working more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:33.430
<v S11>than Edinburgh by a fair amount.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:36.490
<v S11>But I think I know Ross was especially good at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:37.570
<v S11>this and I tried when I could.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.370

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:23.610

01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:36.870

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:49.140
<v S11>And, um, another important thing is, uh, they are very

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.660

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:55.360

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.130

<v S15>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:19.660

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.670

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:22.960
<v S15>Yeah, that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:25.810
<v S15>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v S15>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:30.100

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.490

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.650

01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:42.280

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:42.910

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:46.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:53.040

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:53.730

01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:06.570
<v S15>EPFL.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:08.610
<v S15>A very small portion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:14.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:16.110

01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:25.470

01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:26.970

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:28.080
<v S15>So yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.990
<v S14>So this is my course selection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:32.460
<v S14>I do maths and CSS, so I have a bit

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.240

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:35.130
<v S14>I also had a little French course despite being half

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:38.100
<v S14>French, I took a sort of slightly higher level and

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.050

01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:41.820
<v S14>So a little bit of potential to mix some things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:44.250

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:47.250

01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:49.680

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.780

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:57.710
<v S14>at Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.870

01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:01.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:03.320
<v S14>And then the bachelors was a mix of masters and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.910
<v S14>and and bachelors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100]}

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:07.880
<v S15>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.640

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.960
<v S15>like fundamental courses that I thought, um, since I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,94]}

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.000

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:17.570
<v S15>know about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:19.550
<v S15>So this is kind of like the courses I took.

01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:24.140
<v S15>It's mostly software related, um, construction courses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:26.540
<v S15>Um, there is one course that I would recommend if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.350
<v S15>you are, um, if you like, uh, building apps and

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:32.210

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:33:32.210 --> 01:33:33.680
<v S15>I think I learned a lot from there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:37.340
<v S15>Um, and yeah, other than that, there's a mixture of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:40.580
<v S15>bachelor and master level courses and just like shortage as

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:41.000
<v S15>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.460
<v S15>I think I got better grades than the Masters one

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.360
<v S15>for some reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.920
<v S15>Um, but yeah, sometimes the bachelors ones, I think they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.470
<v S15>drill you a lot in the concepts, so it's very

01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:51.220
<v S15>assignment heavy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.880
<v S15>Whereas some of the master's courses, um, aren't as assignment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,95,100,100,100]}

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.000

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.910

<v S18>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:30.320

<v S18>all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.640
<v S18>Um, the Caltech is really small, and I cannot emphasise

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.450

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:43.190
<v S18>It has roughly 2000 something total students across undergraduate, post-grad,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:47.570
<v S18>Um, I know people just before me, and, uh, well,

01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:50.120
<v S18>I think almost everyone before me was like, oh, large

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:50.750
<v S18>class sizes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:51.950
<v S18>I know there will be a question on that at

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:52.610
<v S18>some point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:55.760
<v S18>My class sizes were about 20 to 30 max for

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.790
<v S18>everything, and that's like a heavy course when it reaches

01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:59.330
<v S18>30.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:01.610
<v S18>So super small class sizes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:03.290
<v S18>And the benefit of that is of course, you get

01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:04.550

01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:05.750
<v S18>You can ask more questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.270
<v S18>Um, you feel less bad about holding of the class

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100]}

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:11.300

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.260

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:14.300

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:15.320

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.810
<v S18>Uh, another big part about Caltech is its honour code

01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:21.380

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.810
<v S18>why I bring this up is it's super integral to

01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:34.090

01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:38.140

01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:43.030
<v S18>And one of the best things that comes from this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:46.030

01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.600
<v S18>and all that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:50.080
<v S18>It's also that they're nice to you outside of classes

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.090
<v S18>or in general on campus or around.

01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:56.380
<v S18>It's sort of like, um, well, it creates this really,

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:59.800

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.360

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.200
<v S18>anyone, um, and not be afraid of, like, I don't

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.790
<v S18>know, them stealing your ideas and such because that's, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.670
<v S18>apparently there have been stories from Caltech where that has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:14.980

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.070

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.390
<v S18>so that that never happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55]}

01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:21.280
<v S18>So it's it's super nice that that is the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:21.730 --> 01:44:23.890
<v S18>Um, another big reason to go to Caltech is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:26.580
<v S18>there are many conferences that are either held there or

01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:27.630
<v S18>somewhere in California.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:31.950
<v S18>Um, a lot of the ones are just at least

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:33.960
<v S18>the ones that I went to were just at Caltech.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.440
<v S18>So around any of those topics up there, and if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:37.710 --> 01:44:41.010
<v S18>one of them is not there, probably somewhere, uh, near,

01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:43.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:45.240
<v S18>So that's a good reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.600
<v S18>Uh, if you're interested in aerospace, um, if you didn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.250
<v S18>know, um, Caltech sort of doesn't own, uh, the Jet

01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:56.880

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.880
<v S18>So if you're interested in that type of stuff, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:03.420
<v S18>unless you're American, you can't really go in the Jet

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:06.600

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.250
<v S18>meet the folk there and sort of talk to them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:10.800
<v S18>and go like, oh, you know, I'm interested in maybe

01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:12.150
<v S18>you'll get something out of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

01:45:12.630 --> 01:45:14.370
<v S18>Um, the other last point that I really want to

01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:16.950
<v S18>mention, especially because the weather today was not so nice,

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.350

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:35.050

01:49:35.050 --> 01:49:37.030

01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:43.540

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:54.220

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:22.400

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.940

01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:40.100

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.210

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.180
<v S18>Um, another thing that I want to quickly mention is,

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:49.880
<v S18>unlike most other universities, Caltech works on a timely basis

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.110

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,48]}

01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:56.330
<v S18>So there's three terms, um, and you'll roughly be taking

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:59.240
<v S18>4 to 6 courses, depending on sort of the, the

01:51:03.650 --> 01:51:07.130
<v S18>So I did roughly 13 courses in total while I

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:07.730

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

01:51:08.210 --> 01:51:11.990
<v S18>Um, and you can also, uh, as I said before,

01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:13.690
<v S18>when I said you can do research, you can also

01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:15.400
<v S18>turn that into a course for you to do so

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.630

01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:20.290

01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:25.660
<v S18>So as I said, my, uh, slides were not very

01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:26.050

<v S18>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.330

<v S18>Caltech.

01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:23.670

01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:29.040
<v S18>very unsurprisingly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73]}

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:33.180
<v S18>Um, one of the professors there, uh, was head of

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:46.860
