<v Speaker 1>How many of you cycle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Not very many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting time of year for cyclists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Um, so I said we were beginning to move away

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>We're still doing one more week of logic, but we're

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.060

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually possible that some of you already know

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>this stuff, so who knows.

<v Speaker 1>Corner maps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,97]}

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay, you can go to sleep for the week if

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Or you might learn something new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>You never know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>As you can see from the slide, we're reaching into

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century in terms of the work done, which

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>means that we're at the sad stage of the course

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>where every week I have to go and check whether

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>the people on my cover slides are still alive or

<v Speaker 1>not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And sadly, Maurice Connor died in my second year of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>teaching the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I never met him.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>He looks as if he was a lovely guy, but

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually know that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So the topic of today and to Thursday is Connor

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>maps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>What are coronal maps?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,35,99]}

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>They're a way of extracting a formula from a picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So we've been using Venn diagrams to try to understand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>formulae and kernel maps without going the other way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you have the picture or the truth

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>table and you want to get a formula out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that engineers want to do because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>engineers work in pictures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be stereotyping vigorously for the next week,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>but you need to program informally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So to set up the context, suppose we have two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>predicates that we're thinking about called a and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>How many different universes are there with A and B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>predicates?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>For I'm seeing a lot of some hands saying for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>any want to choose anything other than four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's how many different regions there are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Now, is that the same as the number of universes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.450
<v Speaker 1>we can distinguish?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100]}

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.180
<v Speaker 1>So because two predicates lets us to separate the universe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>into four bits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 1>So in principle, we could construct a universe with different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.100
<v Speaker 1>things in each of those four bits, which might give

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Speaker 1>us a new idea about how many distinct universes there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.820
<v Speaker 1>are, which have just two predicates in them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So the people who have four, do you feel inclined

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.930
<v Speaker 1>to change your mind?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You've got four by going two to the two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.250
<v Speaker 1>So if I have A and B, I can describe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 1>four regions of the universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Um, what does it mean for two universes to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.180
<v Speaker 1>distinguishable?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Basically, it's whether they're inhabited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100]}

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Each region is inhabited or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Could be empty, could be inhabited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So if I have four regions and each of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 1>can be either inhabited or empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>How many different universes does that give me?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:17.959
<v Speaker 1>16.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.049
<v Speaker 1>So yeah, they look like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a lot of different universes with predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>And you can obviously see what happens as you add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 1>predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Um, if we do the calculation, the numbers grow up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Um, how many of you get extremely annoyed every time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>some non-technical person talks about something increasing exponentially?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully by the end of this course, that will be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 1>99.8% of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>This is a case of exponential growth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact, it's worse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a case of doubly exponential gross growth, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful concept with four predicates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>There are 65,000 different universes that we could be talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the questions we might ask is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>given a universe with these predicates, can we write down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>the formula that describes it uniquely amongst all the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>universes?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>So by example, if we're looking at this very simple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>universe here, this is what we had as the syllogism,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>as the categorical proposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Every B is A right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>So every B is a was our syllogism or categorical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>proposition statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>But can we just describe it in terms of Boolean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>logic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Well we look at it and say which regions are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>inhabited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>The outside is that is, that is and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.480
<v Speaker 1>So we can just describe each region in term in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.750
<v Speaker 1>turn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.110
<v Speaker 1>We can say not A or B, um, whereas not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,86,51,100]}

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.680
<v Speaker 1>A or B that's the outside or a or not,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>b or not B is there or a and B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.510
<v Speaker 1>or the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay for any of those to be inhabited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's a brute force way of describing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at every inhabited region and saying that they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>can all be inhabited, but this one isn't mentioned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.760
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 1>But that's certainly not the shortest formula we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And if we're going to describe this universe for circuit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.600
<v Speaker 1>layout tool or whatever it is we're doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>So these were electronic engineers that did this or electrical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.520
<v Speaker 1>engineers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.130
<v Speaker 1>The difference was less well defined in those days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,88,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.590
<v Speaker 1>If we look at that formula, there are a bunch

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100]}

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>of things we can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It can be simplified in various ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 1>So it can be simplified like that by pulling out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>A, not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,94]}

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Um, we could alternatively think about describing the places that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>are empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So this region here is what region is this B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and not a b and not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And that must be false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So we could describe this universe by saying that B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and not A must be false negating it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And then we could apply to Morgan's law if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>want it and say it's A or not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,98]}

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So a bunch of formulae, all of which are equivalent,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 1>all of which describe this universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And the question is, if I give you something that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 1>is not just a two predicate picture where you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 1>16 choices, but a four for a picture where you

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>have 65,000 choices, how can you go from the picture

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.060
<v Speaker 1>which you can't understand, or the truth table To a

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.060
<v Speaker 1>formula that uniquely characterises the universe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you get what we're trying to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Extract here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,50]}

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Um, I can increase it by one tiny notch, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.560
<v Speaker 1>otherwise I can try putting this closer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Does that help?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay, thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Um, so the idea here is getting a logical description

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.750
<v Speaker 1>from something that is either a picture or just the

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.669
<v Speaker 1>truth table, because these pictures are our graphical way of

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.770
<v Speaker 1>representing truth tables in one way.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a little side issue here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.340
<v Speaker 1>This is actually a relevant side issue for computer scientists.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Um, back in the olden days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>And actually, still, you probably don't need to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>But back in the olden days, discs were expensive, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>when you bought a 200 gigabyte disk, you expected to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>be able to fit 200GB of files on it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was very annoying to find out that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>could only fit 195GB or whatever it is on it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was because disk manufacturers use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the C prefix giga, which means multiply by ten to

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.840

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 1>binary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I hope that computer's not about to explode.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Most things in computer science use the binary prefix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>We say giga, but usually we don't mean multiply by

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>ten to the minus nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Usually we mean multiply by ten to the 30, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>is 1074 Around 74 million, roughly, instead of a thousand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>million.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So this was a great source of annoyance for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>large portion of my life.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And eventually somebody, although not the people who define.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So I decided that the computing industry really needed binary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>prefixes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So some of you may have seen these, some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you may know them, but some of you may have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>seen them without knowing them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 1>They are actually a useful thing to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>So you will see people in computer science and the

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 1>other binary oriented subjects talking about Chip, maybe, and Gibby,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>meaning multiply by two to the 10,024.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So when we say kilobyte in computer science, we always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>mean KiB byte.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,42,100]}

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever means a thousand bytes when they say kilobyte.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Likewise megabytes, likewise gigabytes when you're talking about memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 1>But as I said, the disk manufacturers and also the

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.070
<v Speaker 1>tape manufacturers used to talk about gigabytes in the sense

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.720

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a little side issue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Um, incidentally, this is another completely random thing I said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Which surprised me because even when I was a student

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.620

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.810

<v Speaker 1>later.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.540
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to cover this L shape by

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.080

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you going to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I could cover it by three, one by one squares.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.850

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.010

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 1>For others it isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.290
<v Speaker 1>So what's an alternative?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.880
<v Speaker 1>One square off, one square on top and a rectangle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Now bear in mind that these are boolean values, so

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if I overlap them.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.680

<v Speaker 1>L.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.010

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Which one is nice?

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.360

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Um, now I claim that that is something that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.170
<v Speaker 1>particularly short because it gives you a nice short description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 1>In particular, it gives me the description of the L

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the things that are a so where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.080
<v Speaker 1>is A1 there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,67]}

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And together with the things that are not B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50]}

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So if I cover the L by two rectangles, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I get a formula coming out which is of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>form A or not B, which I claim is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.560
<v Speaker 1>nice short formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.829
<v Speaker 1>If I did that division, which was one of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.730
<v Speaker 1>earlier suggestions, the square at the top and the rectangle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.370
<v Speaker 1>along the bottom, what formula would I get out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean, eventually I would.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,68]}

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.710
<v Speaker 1>So how would I get that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean, let's not do anything clever yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's just describe the picture in front of us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to describe a single square on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 1>the top, which is defined as not a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm trying to describe the rectangle on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 1>bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Which is um a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100]}

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Um, now if you simplify that formula, of course you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 1>get back to the one that we found by covering

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it with two rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But the nice thing about looking for the biggest rectangles

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 1>that cover the shape is that you get the short

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>formula out by staring at that, rather than by having

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 1>to do simplification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Notice by the way, that when I try to describe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 1>a single square in this diagram, I have to talk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 1>about two variables because I'm identifying one cell in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>two dimensional array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.690
<v Speaker 1>When I talk about a row, then I only need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 1>to mention one variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So the bigger the rectangle I'm describing, the fewer variables

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I have to specify to say what it is, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 1>that makes for short formulae.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's why we look for the largest even rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I said I'd tell you what I mean by an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 1>even rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually mean that it has an even number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 1>of cells in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100]}

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean that its width and height are powers of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>two so that it divides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It's either half a table or quarter of a table,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 1>or an eighth of a table, so that it covers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>one particular variable value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.380
<v Speaker 1>We should, uh, make sure that we've got this two

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 1>variable case sorted out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So do you see what we're doing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Should we do another example?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's call.

<v Speaker 1>Sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

<v Speaker 1>Um, what truth table shall we do?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Something could do.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Something perverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 1>Somebody give me one.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Now, that's a nasty one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Why is it a nasty one?

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So if we tediously do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.730
<v Speaker 1>What formula do we get out?

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.610
<v Speaker 1>So people at the front sort of keep quiet for

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.830
<v Speaker 1>a moment, because the other people need to think for

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.400
<v Speaker 1>a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Can anybody at least halfway back shout out a formula?

<v Speaker 1>For.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Not P and not Q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:27.650
<v Speaker 1>That describes that single cell there or P and Q

<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:50.990

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 1>But this is back in the old days of manual

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.080
<v Speaker 1>circuit design.

<v Speaker 1>So just before I go on, any immediate questions about

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.230
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.830

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 1>In fact, they extended it up to six or even

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to stick to four variables.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.060
<v Speaker 1>How can we write down a truth table for four

<v Speaker 1>variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about what a truth table for

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So what I've done here is write down a four

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.850

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.300
<v Speaker 1>So I've got A and B, and I'm writing down

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.380
<v Speaker 1>combined values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100]}

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So A is zero, B is zero, a is zero,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>b is one as b as one, b is one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Similarly, along the top I've written down combined values of

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.040

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll notice that I have not written these values

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.170
<v Speaker 1>in the natural order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So I've gone in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Normally you would expect to go 00011011 because that's how

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.170
<v Speaker 1>we count.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>At least it's how we count when we've mastered binary,

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.480
<v Speaker 1>which hopefully you all did many years ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Instead, I've written them in this order, and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.500
<v Speaker 1>a very clever and nice little trick.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So the phrase for writing things in this order is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.010
<v Speaker 1>writing them as a grey code, which Wikipedia will tell

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Um, the nice thing about it is that as you

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.270
<v Speaker 1>move from one column to another, only one variable is

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.260

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90]}

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So when I move from zero to 0 to 0,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.100
<v Speaker 1>one d is changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100]}

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.950
<v Speaker 1>When I move from zero 1 to 1 one, then

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.060
<v Speaker 1>C is changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.510
<v Speaker 1>When I move from one 1 to 1 zero, then

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.650
<v Speaker 1>D is changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Um, why is that nice?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It partly makes the extraction of rectangles easier, and also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.510
<v Speaker 1>it avoids a problem that is important in circuit design,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 1>which is race conditions.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.150
<v Speaker 1>to come across race conditions and we will see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We will mention briefly at the end of this section

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 1>how this grey code stuff helps you with that.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Um, so what am I going to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Well, I can do things like identify a region.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>So here is a rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's an even rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And this is characterised by the variable a being one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the rows here, it's the

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 1>rows where a is one and c and d or

00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 1>anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I want to look at the region

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>where b is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So again if I look at the region where B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 1>is one, I get a nice contiguous rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And this wouldn't happen if I wrote these combined values

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 1>in the usual order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 1>So something you should do after the lecture is convince

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>yourself of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Write out the truth table in the usual order and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>see how you wouldn't get nice rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So this describes the region where b is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And similarly this is the region where c is one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 1>and this is the region where d is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 1>So any place where one variable takes on A a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,83]}

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>true value is nicely described by a two by four

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 1>rectangle in the table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 1>But of course we also want to think about what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 1>happens when variables are false, because we might need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 1>describe a universe in which variables take false values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And at first sight, it might look as if this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.800

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So if I look at.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.890
<v Speaker 2>The.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Places where A is zero light pink, then I get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 1>this nice two by four rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 1>But if I want to look at the places where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 1>B is zero, I get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And at first sight that's not a two by four

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 1>rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Last time we had a discussion about geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 1>So here's some geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100]}

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 1>The keyword is in the title of the slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 1>On what surface?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 1>If we do this to this truth table on a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.730
<v Speaker 1>suitable surface, we could make this thing be actually a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 1>rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Um, and now I get to the question who remembers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 1>what a torus is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay, who thinks they should remember what a torus is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 1>and who is quite sure they've never heard the word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay, a torus is a ring doughnut.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Um, I don't know why mathematicians can't call it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I suppose because doughnut is an ambiguous word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.590
<v Speaker 1>There are wing doughnuts, and there are proper doughnuts with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,58,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.230
<v Speaker 1>a hole in the middle and jam that squirts out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.960
<v Speaker 1>But if we draw the truth table on a torus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.800
<v Speaker 1>on a ring doughnut, then both the zero values and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.750
<v Speaker 1>the one values are rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.940
<v Speaker 1>So the same happens with c and d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Um, this is where c is zero and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.970
<v Speaker 1>where d is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And the way we think about it is like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So values wrap around from the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,51,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.970
<v Speaker 1>They wrap around from the right to the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So if I go right from here I end up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:59.210
<v Speaker 1>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.090
<v Speaker 1>If I go up from here I end up at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and so on and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And there is a picture which I googled up because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any graphics package well enough to draw

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.690
<v Speaker 1>a coloured torus, but fortunately somebody else does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Um, So this is a picture of the truth table

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.820
<v Speaker 1>with slightly different colours drawn on a torus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,71,100,100,100,86]}

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So I've got red and blue and green and yellow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.090
<v Speaker 1>instead of my colours, but roughly it matches.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.070
<v Speaker 1>So this is strictly speaking it's due to a two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,93,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.670
<v Speaker 1>dimensional geometry, but it's two dimensional geometry on an interestingly

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.960
<v Speaker 1>curved surface.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And many of us are not very good at thinking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>about these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Um, I have lousy geometrical visualisation capacities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Um, in fact, the other day I found a courier's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.410
<v Speaker 1>report from when I was 16, which said I had

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.020
<v Speaker 1>lousy spatial visualisation capacities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100]}

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It's still true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.220
<v Speaker 1>But fortunately, we can look at it, look at truth

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.150
<v Speaker 1>tables and do it more diagrammatically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Um, any questions at this point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I think examples are what we need to see how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.830
<v Speaker 1>to do this successfully, what I need it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51,100,100,100,97]}

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I, by the way, knew none of this before I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.140

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.540
<v Speaker 1>scientist by origin, I managed to avoid this bit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.410
<v Speaker 1>electronics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Um, so here's a four dimensional truth table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It has a bunch of zeros and it has a

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.560
<v Speaker 1>bunch of ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.840
<v Speaker 1>This is an easy one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.340
<v Speaker 1>What's the easiest rectangle that describes it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.450
<v Speaker 1>The simplest possible thing, the square in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And somebody said that's B and D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Why is it B and D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Because this is where B is one and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.440
<v Speaker 1>where d is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So far so good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 1>That was what we got that everybody see that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Anybody worried about it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Not quite sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100]}

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Also straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Be a Nazi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,57]}

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So just look at the rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Look at the rows that describe it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the rose where B is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,67,100,100]}

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Look at the columns that describe is the rose where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,46,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.950
<v Speaker 1>c is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100]}

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Um so that's a nice easy case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.170
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do another couple of easy cases before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.320
<v Speaker 1>getting on to slightly more challenging ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.730
<v Speaker 1>What about this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.730
<v Speaker 1>This is also something where there are four true souls,

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but now they're laid out all in a row instead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 1>of in a nice little square.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Does that make a difference to how complex the formula

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.450
<v Speaker 1>is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Not really.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Um, that's my rectangle I'm trying to cover.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And if I try to describe it, it's this row,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.590
<v Speaker 1>which is where A is zero and B is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So this is described by not A and not be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Any questions so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Anybody not follow any of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And is willing to admit it which is always the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.960
<v Speaker 1>hard part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.850
<v Speaker 1>What about this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.139
<v Speaker 1>So again, looking looking at the people a few rows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:28.990
<v Speaker 1>back, how many rectangles are there to cover?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay, lots of people are getting it good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:39.399
<v Speaker 1>So this is the tricky one where we say looks

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 1>like there are two rectangles, but there's only one because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.629
<v Speaker 1>this can wrap around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90]}

00:34:43.629 --> 00:34:45.790
<v Speaker 1>And actually we just have a square again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.639
<v Speaker 1>And this is the cute bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So this is just a and sorry not A and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>not D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:55.659
<v Speaker 1>By the same principle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:01.030
<v Speaker 1>This rectangle here which wraps round is uh where a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,88,100,100]}

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.360
<v Speaker 1>is zero and d is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's more or less it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of other cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So everybody see that one now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Because if you see this one then essentially you're done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81]}

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Anybody.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Not yet see it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to say so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:29.550
<v Speaker 1>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,27]}

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be done with week six, but maybe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:32.340
<v Speaker 1>not quite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so here's a slightly more complex example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Now we have two rectangles apparently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Can we do anything about this or do we just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.750
<v Speaker 1>have to say we have two rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And if we have two rectangles what's the formula that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.150
<v Speaker 1>comes out of it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Well, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100]}

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So if we have two things to deal with, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 1>we need to all them together, as we did with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 1>that example there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>We had two one by one cells and we ored

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,99]}

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.530
<v Speaker 1>them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Here we can't do anything clever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>We just have to recognise that there's a two by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 1>two cell and a two by two cell here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't overlap, they're just completely distinct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So the shortest sensible description or the shortest description we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 1>can obviously extract of this table is the red cells

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 1>or the green cells which are not A and not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.520
<v Speaker 1>C or A and C.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Everybody happy with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So here's the one that sometimes catches people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.270
<v Speaker 1>How many rectangles?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.160
<v Speaker 1>One.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at some people to see if they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 1>going to change their minds as they hear other people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100]}

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have quite a lot of votes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 1>for one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have quite a lot of votes for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:36.810
<v Speaker 1>one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Because this is the tricky thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.210
<v Speaker 1>The torus bends meets itself both ways that way and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 1>So the four corners are actually all next to each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 1>other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>So this is a single two by two cell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the description of it then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you can see that it's where um in fact where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.430
<v Speaker 1>is it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 1>It's where.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 1>C d is zero and d is zero because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:18.170
<v Speaker 1>those two columns and um, b is zero because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.520
<v Speaker 1>those two rows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So not b and not d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.690
<v Speaker 1>That's probably quite tricky.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And notice again we've found in this diagram we found

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.660
<v Speaker 1>a single two by two cell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a nice short formula with just two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.530
<v Speaker 1>variables in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.830
<v Speaker 1>So of course this is a general thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.810
<v Speaker 1>If we see a one by one cell we get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.510
<v Speaker 1>a variable with four things anded together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.760
<v Speaker 1>If we saw a one by two cell, we would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.920
<v Speaker 1>have three variables added together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100]}

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.710
<v Speaker 1>When we see a two by two cell, we get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.780
<v Speaker 1>two variables and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's the complex toroidal one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,81]}

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Anybody not see what we're doing there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Willie, I should come in with a flotation aid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,98]}

<v Speaker 1>Appropriately coloured.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Um, what about this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So now things are getting a little bit more complex,

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.110
<v Speaker 1>and you might need to ponder this one for a

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.550
<v Speaker 1>What a natural ways to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.580
<v Speaker 1>There are quite a few different ways we could cover

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.690
<v Speaker 1>this with rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.450
<v Speaker 1>The question is, which one is a good one or

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.890
<v Speaker 1>which ones might we try?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 1>You have several possibilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Um, was anybody thinking of this one?

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.510
<v Speaker 1>So this looks pretty straightforward, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.540
<v Speaker 1>We're looking for even rectangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.830
<v Speaker 1>We've got a column of two there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.270
<v Speaker 1>We've got a column of two there.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.290
<v Speaker 1>And if we describe each of them in turn we

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.370
<v Speaker 1>get not a not c, not d, b, not c,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.590

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 1>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Um, in this particular case, there isn't anything better we

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 1>can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.260
<v Speaker 1>We could cover it with a different assortment of rectangles,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.360
<v Speaker 1>perhaps, but it wouldn't make any difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.420
<v Speaker 1>So now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about something a little bit more complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And think about what's the obvious thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Who thinks this is the obvious thing to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the obvious thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Anybody think it's not the obvious thing to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 1>What's the obvious thing to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Ah, but we can't do that because three is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.510
<v Speaker 1>an even rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>So we can't go that and that because that would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.890
<v Speaker 1>give us a three by one which isn't allowed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So rectangles with sides that are powers of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.910
<v Speaker 1>This seems like the obvious thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.620
<v Speaker 1>What happens if we do that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.760
<v Speaker 1>We get a nasty long formula because it's describing a

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.350

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So this cell is described by A and B and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.990
<v Speaker 1>not c and d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And then this square is described by a and c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So we all them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,100,100]}

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.640
<v Speaker 1>And if we get a formula with six symbols in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it could we do any better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Could we be a little bit sneaky and make the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Speaker 1>formula slightly shorter?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.420
<v Speaker 4>The one in the middle who just had it be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,16,100,86,81,100]}

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.080
<v Speaker 4>a rectangle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if anybody else further back can come up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.170
<v Speaker 1>with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:55.150
<v Speaker 1>If we overlap things we can do a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.780
<v Speaker 1>better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.920
<v Speaker 1>So this is legitimate, perfectly fine for things to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.890
<v Speaker 1>overlapping because we're oring all these things together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter if we cover a particular cell

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.100
<v Speaker 1>twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And by having this redundant cell here, we have saved

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.330

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you're doing

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.910

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:29.230

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.280

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.490
