So we got some technical problems.
Just hang on and we'll we'll get there.

Ha!
It's a little bit long.
We've got.
Are academics no academic children?
Oh.
Check it.
Oh, I know they're doing it, but I don't know
whether parents are important.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
This is longer than mine.
It's just coming to an end now.
Yeah, yeah.
And so we're playing the.
Just my drumroll comes.
Just for.
Yeah, just for first place.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
So some technical issues there.
And, , that that was, , singing Away the Cold
and Edinburgh jazz piece by Digby Fairweather, , which I
thought would be appropriate.
It's not that cold today, but, .
Yeah.
, so, yeah, we've had some technical troubles, so, ,
let's see.
I guess we'll use this laptop.
And this is Alice Graham, who is your Ta for
this course?
, she's been doing all the work for the the
tutorial exercises and things that.
So, , and also managing the, , the competition.
So take it away, Alice.
So we've got, , we've got some videos here.
So I'll do a little intro first.
So yeah.
Thanks everyone for coming.
I know it's week 11, everyone's tired and they have
loads of coursework.
I really appreciate you being here.
, so as Don said, I'm the teaching assistant for
this course, which means a lot of things.
But most excitingly, I've been marking the RP competition.
So if you don't know what that is, every year
we have the same competition.
It's sponsored by Galois, and basically everyone has the same
challenge.
You have to create some sort of visualisation or graphics
using Haskell.
And this year we had 26 entries, which is the
most ever by a really, really long way.
So you guys have done really well and the quality
of the entries was really amazing as well and had
such a good time looking through all the projects.
So the way this is going to work is I've
got a video to show all the runners up, and
then after that we're going to do an award for
the best Piazza contributor and then third, second and first
place.
So yeah, I just play the video to show the
projects.
Yeah.
Oh.
All right.
So let's let's give applause.
Those are the runners up.
Under the piazza.
Yeah.
So before we go to the the prize winners, I
have another award here.
And this is for the, , the best Piazza contributor.
, and if if you've been active at all on
Piazza, you probably know who's going to win this.
Because this person always gets there before Julian and me
and answers the question most of the time.
, better than we can.
So, yeah.
So the winner of this of this prize and this
comes with a little, , Amazon gift voucher, , which
is, by the way, sponsored by the authors of the
textbook.
, there's some, some of the royal portion of the
royalties goes to a to a prize fund for this
and for and for other things.
, yeah.
Shlok Gupta is are you here?
Yes, yes.
So come on up.
Get your prize.
Yep.
So thank you.
So you get a certificate as well.
Okay.
So thank you very much.
, yeah.
So, , yeah.
Very helpful.
, very helpful contributions.
Okay.
So, yeah, on.
To the prize winners.
, we have actually two people in third place, but
before I announce them, I just wanted to say well
done again for everyone who submitted.
But as you saw, the projects were so varied and
I thought they were all really cool.
So well done and still definitely put it on your
CV you'll have runner up.
And I just think, even doing a project alongside
uni is really impressive.
Yeah.
.
I'm going to turn off the lights because these things
are better seen in darkness, I think.
Okay.
Or at least semi semi.
So the first person in third place is I'm sorry
if I mispronounce anyone's names for an Iskander of the
hydrogen wavefunction.
Are you here?
Yeah.
Should we do we want to do.
.
So I just thought this was a really great visualisation
of a topic, which I know I found conceptually very
difficult at school.
It's basically the probability of finding an electron anywhere within
a hydrogen atom as the energy levels go up.
So I can show you.
Is this is there something gone wrong with the.
I think your computer just turned off.
Oh.
We're back.
Okay.
It's there.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah, so well done.
And.
Just one of the other B.
And C on.
Okay.
Yeah.
So congratulations.
Yeah.
So there's your certificate okay.
Thank you.
Yeah.
By the way, all the winners will get an email
from me with, , , Amazon gift voucher.
Okay.
Not not a lot of, , don't get too excited,
but it's the it's the fame that counts, I think.
Nice and in joint third place was Zhang Yan for
a fluid simulation project.
.
, so basically, Zhang did a smooth particle hydrodynamics,
which I'm not even sure I understand what that means.
To simulate fluid motion in 2D.
And the reason I love this one so much is
because it's so interactive.
You can turn gravity on, turn gravity off, and it's
just a really good way, I think, to teach people
about particles.
So I thought it was really cool.
I'll show you what it looked .
Oh.
Your computer is.
Crashed.
No.
My computer has crashed.
, okay.
That doesn't happen very much.
What do I do?
Command Q.
Try quit.
huh.
Okay.
Let's see.
I don't know what to do.
, so I suggest you use yours without music.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, , my computer is crashed.
I don't know if that was to do to the
last due to the last simulation or what.
Some somehow that's come back up.
I don't understand this.
Anyway.
We can use mine.
Yeah.
So this will be without music, unfortunately.
But, .
Because we couldn't get the music to work on Alice's
laptop top.
Shut this up so people don't see one.
Okay.
Okay.
It's not.
Gonna work.
It's not working.
.
I'll just turn the sound off.
Can you play it for my computer?
Right.
Thanks.
So is Zhang here?
All right.
Yes.
Whoops.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
There you go.
Okay.
Okay, onto second place now.
, this one was really cool because I liked that
it took artistic influence instead of mathematical influence, most
of the other projects.
So the winner of second place is Jiang Zhang.
Yes.
, yeah.
So this project was really cool.
It took inspiration from the Pink Floyd album cover, you
know, with the prism and the light shining through, and
it's basically an interactive simulation of that, which I thought
was really cool and a cool place to decide to
do a house school project on us.
And we love the interactivity again.
I'll show you the video.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, come on up.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Great.
Great work.
.
So now we need to get ready for this next
one?
Yeah.
Are you.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, because I've got to switch.
I've got to do some switching here.
So, .
, okay, so the winner of the first prize is.
There's no sound.
Oh.
It's on my running bag.
, okay.
Yeah.
This one, we were just, again, really impressed by the
interactivity and again, that it was quite artistic.
, basically, what you can do is you can draw
any image you want, and it will kind of simulate
that image using the Fourier series and show all the
vectors that add up to make your image.
And it's a really cool animation.
, and yeah, you can choose your own path or
there are some built in ones too.
I thought it was really cool.
Nice.
Congratulations.
And just a second.
I've got a special some special music for this year.
Oh, and there's advertising beforehand.
Japanese chef's.
Knife.
Thousand.
Dollar trap.
Why is this not louder?
So congratulations.
Great.
Great work.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm really impressed by the work of everybody who
submitted, , who submitted something.
, so those of you who didn't submit be inspired
by what your classmates have managed to do.
Okay.
And, , I think that's the end.
Right.
So, , that's it for, , functional programming this year.
, hope you enjoyed it.
And, , maybe some of you want to come back
next year and be teachers or demonstrators.
Okay, look out for the advert.
, towards the end of the year for, , for
people to help out.
Okay.
Thanks, everybody.
Yeah, yeah.
And thanks.
Yeah.
No technical problems?
Yeah.
It's a shame.
Last year.
I had.
What happened?
I think it was, , the machine decided to reboot
itself.
For a.
Night just before my lecture started, and it took.
15 minutes, you know?
That's really hard as well, because you only had your
15 minutes long.
It's not you can.
Yeah.
You can.
Exactly.
And it started doing this.
And I have no idea how long.
It's going to take.
It just it just.
Okay.
B c.
Disclaimer.
What's the sound will go through that as well?
Do do do do do do do.
So what am I going to do?
Is so.
