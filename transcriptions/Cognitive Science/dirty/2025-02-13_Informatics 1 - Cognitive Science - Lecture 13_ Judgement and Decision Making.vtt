00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.640
<v Speaker 0>So, um, here's the barcode for work lab.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,98,100,100,94,100,52,72]}

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's the same deal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 0>I can't connect my laptop with a different laptop, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,93,100,100,58]}

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 0>it still doesn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100]}

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you won't be able to see the lab

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 0>results, but you'll be able to take part anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, so go to this URL or scan the code,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 0>please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh, really?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,93]}

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100]}

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 0>Is it not working?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 0>I don't see any participants yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 0>Have you tried the barcode or the URL up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,52]}

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 0>Know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so it must be a problem on my side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think you can get rid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,44,50,50,50,56,56,56,52]}

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>This.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35]}

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,42]}

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 0>Can you try now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 0>I can see 29 people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 0>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 0>All right, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 0>So today's lecture is going to be a bit different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 0>in the sense it's not about language or anything like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 0>Not even about categories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 0>It's about decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 0>So the question is, you know, why would you be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 0>interested in decision making and how does it relate to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 0>the rest of the course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 0>Well, there's two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.229
<v Speaker 0>So one of them is that decision making obviously is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 0>a, um, a cognitive task that we face every day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 0>We get up, we decide whether to have tea or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 0>coffee for breakfast and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 0>So there's decisions, lots of decisions every day for all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 0>of us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 0>And it's not even just humans, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 0>Animals make decisions all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 0>Should they, should they run away or should they fight

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 0>And so that obviously is an interesting object of study.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 0>How do these decisions get made?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 0>What are the factors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 0>What are the mechanisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 0>And so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 0>So we look at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, decisions also have traditionally played a big role in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 0>economics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 0>So where classical economics has assumed that humans are rational

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 0>agents and they behave in an optimal way to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.680
<v Speaker 0>with, I don't know, maximising the benefit for themselves or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 0>maximising their profit and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 0>And then in the in the 60s and 70s, psychologists

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.040
<v Speaker 0>actually started to look at economic decisions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 0>Should I invest or not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, and they found that people aren't rational in, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 0>many ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually a new, relatively new branch of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 0>economics called behavioural economics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 0>And we'll actually meet a bunch of psychologists who who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 0>were involved in starting this, in particular Daniel Kahneman, who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 0>you might have heard of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 0>He was a behavioural scientist studying human decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 0>And actually, he died last year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 0>He's also he was a Nobel Prize winner in economics,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 0>actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 0>And people like Herbert Simon, who is an AI pioneer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,72,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 0>but who was also interested in decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 0>So that's the one thing decisions are interested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 0>Interesting decisions have an important effect in economics, for example,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 0>where economic outcomes are the sum of lots of individual

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 0>decisions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 0>But there's this other aspect that sometimes humans behave in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 0>a way that is maybe not expected, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 0>So far we talked about rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.930
<v Speaker 0>These might be logical rules or might be grammatical rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 0>We talked about probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 0>This is Bayes rule or this is conditional probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 0>And probability obviously tells you how to behave in some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 0>some sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 0>Bayes rule is a rule for decision making ultimately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 0>But it turns out that in many ways humans do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 0>not behave in this optimal, rational, ideal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 0>And that, again, is something that is an interesting thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 0>to study.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 0>And so we'll talk about that as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.490
<v Speaker 0>And that goes under the moniker of cognitive biases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.970
<v Speaker 0>And you might have heard about I don't know, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 0>framing effect or the confirmation bias and stuff like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 0>So we'll talk about biases like this, which people have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 0>also studied quite extensively.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.110
<v Speaker 0>But let's start with some simple examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 0>So judgement is sort of judgement is the process that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 0>leads to decision making right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.800
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's because of uncertainty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Maybe it's because of limited memory and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.360
<v Speaker 0>So we can explain that divergence then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 0>So this is the overall approach.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.440
<v Speaker 0>This is a framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 0>If you remember the first was it the first or

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.360
<v Speaker 0>the second lecture?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 0>I think the second lecture where we talked about um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.700
<v Speaker 0>the taxonomy of cognitive analysis Uh, that was due to,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.020
<v Speaker 0>uh, Andrea and land.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,87]}

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 0>If I remember correctly, where they had a framework, they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 0>had a theory, they had implementation and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.340
<v Speaker 0>So what we're talking about in terms of rational analysis,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 0>this is a framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.580
<v Speaker 0>This is a meta theory in which you can develop

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 0>theories okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.460
<v Speaker 0>And this was the wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.660
<v Speaker 0>So rational analysis goes back to John Anderson who developed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.860
<v Speaker 0>this in the 90s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 0>And he spelled it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,100,100]}

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 0>But also he actually developed a computational, um, it's sort

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.700
<v Speaker 0>of a platform, a computational platform in which you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 0>build, uh, cognitive models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100]}

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.780
<v Speaker 0>This platform is called actor.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 0>You won't this won't be covered in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 0>But if you take a computational modelling course, say in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.790

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 0>So it is both a theoretical framework, but also there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.390
<v Speaker 0>is actually a computational modelling environment behind it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 0>So as I said the the starting assumption is assume

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.470
<v Speaker 0>what's the optimal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.270
<v Speaker 0>What's the rational way of of solving a problem.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 0>So for example we minimise our errors in decision making

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 0>or we maximise some form of reward or utility.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 0>It could be just financial gain right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.150
<v Speaker 0>If it's if it's a financial decision okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 0>So we specify these goals that our cognitive system is

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.190
<v Speaker 0>Then we need to talk about the environment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.990
<v Speaker 0>As I mentioned often these decisions that happen in an

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 0>or is incomplete, um, and then we can figure out

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.200

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if we're interested in the frequency of

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.240
<v Speaker 0>diseases, then maybe sickness is more frequently caused by by

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 0>food.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 0>or social interaction, can lead to transmission of viruses and

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 0>so on can also lead to sickness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.040
<v Speaker 0>In perception we might make assumptions like light comes from

<v Speaker 0>above.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 0>That's almost always the case for humans, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.560
<v Speaker 0>And for example, in face perception, there's studies that show

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 0>if you light a face from from below and from

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.840
<v Speaker 0>above, um, face perception becomes much more difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 0>So that seems to be an inbuilt assumption in communication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 0>People normally do say things in order to be informative

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 0>rather than to deceive or to mislead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.000
<v Speaker 0>And then we also need to think about computational limitations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.080
<v Speaker 0>So we started with this sort of rational assumption here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,47,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.020

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100]}

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.780
<v Speaker 0>Then we looked at the environment, which limits how rational

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.300
<v Speaker 0>we can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.140
<v Speaker 0>We can be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 0>And we also need to look at computational limitations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.300
<v Speaker 0>So we can probably not consider all possible hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.540
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 0>In particular, if it's a very large hypothesis space we

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.340
<v Speaker 0>have limited memory as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.140
<v Speaker 0>We forget stuff all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.940
<v Speaker 0>Perception comes with inaccuracies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.100
<v Speaker 0>We don't always perceive things correctly and so on.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.620
<v Speaker 0>So there is that additional problem that we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.020
<v Speaker 0>take into account, which again might explain that sometimes our

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 0>decisions are not 100% rational.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 0>And as I said, Herb Simon is one of the

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 0>other pioneers here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.940
<v Speaker 0>And he says that rational behaviour is compatible with access

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.300
<v Speaker 0>And he calls this bounded rationality.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:39.900
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.060
<v Speaker 0>So we are rational within reason, right within the bounds

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.990

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.750
<v Speaker 0>And so now we have made all these assumptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.670
<v Speaker 0>And now we can start to formalise this.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.870
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 0>We can, for example, say okay we'll apply Bayes rule

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.430

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we can see whether this behaviour, the

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:17.230

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.470
<v Speaker 0>we study humans.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 0>some sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 0>And then once you have worked this out and you've

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.950

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.750

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.840
<v Speaker 0>How do we build a computational model then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,72]}

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.080
<v Speaker 0>And, um, yeah, as I said, Russian analysis itself is

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.960
<v Speaker 0>not constrained enough to, to, uh, to be a theory.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.200
<v Speaker 0>And often also there's limitations that are not being made

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 0>explicit, in particular computational limitations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 0>Most people don't talk about memory limitations and things like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.800
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.880
<v Speaker 0>And then yeah, we based on that, we can now

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.040

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 0>and the behaviour we see in real, uh, experimental participants.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.120
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there's other things that can go wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.760
<v Speaker 0>People might make assumptions or have tacit expectations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 0>They might solve a different problem from what the experimenter

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.720

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100]}

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.280
<v Speaker 0>The optimal solution might exist, but it might not be

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 0>computational feasible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.520
<v Speaker 0>So that's again the limitations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.500
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, some tasks maybe people are just not adapted

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.580
<v Speaker 0>to because they're, uh, it's not a task that they

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 0>have encountered before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.460
<v Speaker 0>So now with that in mind, we look at some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:04.140
<v Speaker 0>of these, uh, supposed deviations from rational behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 0>And these are often called heuristics or biases in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 0>literature.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, so and they defined as departures from, uh, normative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100]}

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 0>rational theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76]}

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.340
<v Speaker 0>So you say, you're saying, for example, according to Bayes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.820
<v Speaker 0>rule, you should behave like this according to conditional probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.540
<v Speaker 0>You should do this according to I don't know, minimum

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.020
<v Speaker 0>description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.860
<v Speaker 0>Length is something else we've encountered.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 0>This should be the optimal solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.300
<v Speaker 0>But people behave differently, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86]}

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.540
<v Speaker 0>So that would be something we need to explain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.940
<v Speaker 0>And biases are a deviation from rational behaviour for example

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,54,52,33,86,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.380
<v Speaker 0>from probability theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 0>And heuristics are simple strategies that give you fast solutions,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.310
<v Speaker 0>maybe without considering all, all possible or relevant evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so both types of things can exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 0>So there is unfortunately a slight overloading of the term

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 0>bias here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.670
<v Speaker 0>So we've talked about cognitive biases so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:09.790
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember we talked about word acquisition and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 0>the I don't know mutual exclusivity bias or the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:19.150
<v Speaker 0>world whole word bias that helps children acquire words in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.230
<v Speaker 0>an uncertain environment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.870
<v Speaker 0>So this is a different type of bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.430
<v Speaker 0>It's more like a heuristic that allows you to prioritise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.070
<v Speaker 0>certain certain hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 0>So in this case, for example, the hypothesis that a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 0>new word refers to a new object rather than being

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.590
<v Speaker 0>a synonym for another object you know already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 0>So, um, the, the biases that we've talked about so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 0>far, they're sometimes called inductive biases, a bit like in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.640
<v Speaker 0>machine learning where algorithms have inductive biases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 0>Now we're going to talk about the cognitive biases by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,45,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 0>which we mean the deviations from optimal or rational behaviour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:03.640
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.720
<v Speaker 0>So there's an ambiguity in the term here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.400
<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately the the inductive biases are a bit related to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,93,100,100,98,98,93,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.800
<v Speaker 0>heuristics but not exactly the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.200
<v Speaker 0>So with that in mind here are some some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 0>these cognitive biases framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.520
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about that today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 0>And then tomorrow we'll talk about the representative representativeness bias,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.320
<v Speaker 0>the availability bias and the base rate neglect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.480
<v Speaker 0>And um we look at how these have informed models

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.400
<v Speaker 0>of decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.160
<v Speaker 0>And today we're looking at one particular model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.900
<v Speaker 0>This is the model called prospect theory, which goes back

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.260
<v Speaker 0>And let's start with an example.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 0>Anyone chosen option two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 1>The expectation value is higher.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.460
<v Speaker 0>So if you just compute the expectation value, which is

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 0>maybe something you remember from, uh, when when you did

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.580

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.420

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.260

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.620
<v Speaker 0>So if you go in terms of expected value.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.700

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 0>with this bet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 0>Then bet two is better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.820
<v Speaker 0>But most people choose bet one anyway, as your colleague

<v Speaker 0>win.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.180
<v Speaker 0>So that's already an indication that people are maybe not

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.870

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.310
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at another similar one.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.230
<v Speaker 0>So now the option one is 25% chance of winning

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:50.870

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.710

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 0>1 or 2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 0>So no more certain wins in this example.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:32.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37]}

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.530
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:39.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:45.130

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.050

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.130

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,100,65]}

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.570
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly the same as the first question.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 1>It's still 20% plus likelihood one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,97,100,89]}

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.050
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:06.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.890

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.690
<v Speaker 1>So people are biased in this situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,99,97,99,99,66]}

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:14.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.970
<v Speaker 0>That's the that's the that's a good explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,74,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.170
<v Speaker 0>So now if we compute the expected value right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:25.050
<v Speaker 0>Just multiply the probability times the the gain then that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.610
<v Speaker 0>is 7.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 0>In option one and nine in option two.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.140

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.700
<v Speaker 0>better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 0>And because there isn't this bias towards going for the

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.180
<v Speaker 0>certain option, which we had in the previous example, people

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.980

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.820
<v Speaker 0>I mean, also maybe because I explained it after the

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.500
<v Speaker 0>first example that you can you can think about this

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.220
<v Speaker 0>in terms of expected gain or expected utility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.220
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.100
<v Speaker 0>So that was a really simple example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.740
<v Speaker 0>And now let's look at slightly more complicated ones in

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 0>order to talk about the framing effect.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.220
<v Speaker 0>So for this we're using what's called the conjoint bet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60,89,100]}

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.100
<v Speaker 0>And this is Kahneman who invented this or well at

<v Speaker 0>So now we have two beds together and things become

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.980
<v Speaker 0>more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 0>Because okay, one of them might be certain, but the

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.380
<v Speaker 0>And in this example, the problem is also that the

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.900
<v Speaker 0>first bet is about wins, and the other bet is

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.940
<v Speaker 0>about losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 0>So now we can use this to study how people

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.830
<v Speaker 0>trade off wins and losses.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.150

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 0>25%.

<v Speaker 0>Chance of winning £1,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,47]}

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.670
<v Speaker 0>And of course, 75% chance of winning nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.670
<v Speaker 0>And in conjunction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Speaker 0>So you need to bet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.270
<v Speaker 0>In both cases, the second bet is you have a

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 0>sure loss of £750, or you have 25% chance of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.710
<v Speaker 0>losing nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.430
<v Speaker 0>And 75% chance of losing £1,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is, as I said, joint bet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,94]}

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.670
<v Speaker 0>You need to make both beds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.710
<v Speaker 0>And the first one is about wins and the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.870
<v Speaker 0>one's is about losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.910
<v Speaker 0>Again we have a certain win and a certain loss.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, and uh, people then they have four outcomes, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.650
<v Speaker 0>They can do a and c a and d b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.730
<v Speaker 0>and c or b and d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 0>So these are the possible choices here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 0>The possible combined bets or joint bets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.170
<v Speaker 0>And now the question is what do people do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.330
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.610
<v Speaker 0>This is a more complicated situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 0>And maybe people find it harder to work out the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.170
<v Speaker 0>expected value and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.130
<v Speaker 0>So this is an example that is taken from this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.410
<v Speaker 0>paper by by Trotsky and Kahneman, which I've already said

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.050
<v Speaker 0>as a reading for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.410
<v Speaker 0>This is a fun paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 0>So have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.490
<v Speaker 0>It's really old right from the 80s, but it's the

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.130
<v Speaker 0>definition of a classical paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.810
<v Speaker 0>And it's what started prospect theory, which is still a,

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 0>you know, an important and influential theory in behavioural economics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 0>And it's also what won them the Nobel Prize.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.010
<v Speaker 0>Well, Trotsky had already died, unfortunately, when Kahneman got the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Nobel Prize.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, okay, so let's look at this scenario here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.300
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, let's think about what we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.900
<v Speaker 0>expect people to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.780
<v Speaker 0>So maybe they're computing expected values, just like we discussed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 0>in the simple example of a single bed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.460
<v Speaker 0>But maybe they're using something simpler, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.020
<v Speaker 0>They take the best, best case and the least bad

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.980
<v Speaker 0>worst case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 0>So what would that mean here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.100
<v Speaker 0>So the best best case would be you win £1,000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.300
<v Speaker 0>So that's a lot of money.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 0>So maybe people go for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 0>And then the least worst worst case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.500
<v Speaker 0>So here the worst case is you lose a £1,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So maybe then you go for this lose 750 because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 0>this is certain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 0>But at least it's not the worst case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.060
<v Speaker 0>That would be a possible heuristic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,87,100]}

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, and uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.580
<v Speaker 0>Of course we can just ask people and see what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 0>pattern we get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.900
<v Speaker 0>But let's quickly look at expected utility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.380
<v Speaker 0>First.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 0>That's the the third option here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.390
<v Speaker 0>For both cases, they people choose the, uh the outcome

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 0>with the best expected value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 0>And just to formalise this with informally already talked about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 0>this, let's have a bet that has a number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.670
<v Speaker 0>outcomes or 1 or 2 to o n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,68,69,77]}

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.550
<v Speaker 0>And then the expected utility is the sum over all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.230
<v Speaker 0>the outcomes of the probability of the outcome times the

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.790
<v Speaker 0>utility of that outcome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:05.710
<v Speaker 0>And utility is a function that um, we can basically

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.630
<v Speaker 0>that's a parameter, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 0>We don't have to define utility as, you know, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.350
<v Speaker 0>direct monetary value initially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.590
<v Speaker 0>That's what we're going to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.670
<v Speaker 0>But it turns out that's actually not a not the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 0>correct definition okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77]}

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 0>So always the utility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,100,100]}

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.470
<v Speaker 0>So the important question is how do we define, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.710
<v Speaker 0>the utility of all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,47]}

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.610
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let's assume it's simply the monetary value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.130
<v Speaker 0>So the utility of losing £750 would be -750.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.530
<v Speaker 0>The utility of winning £240 would be 240.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 0>And so if we have 25% chance of winning 1,075%

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 0>chance of winning nothing, then the utility would be 0.25

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,93,100,98]}

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 0>times 1000 plus zero point plus 0.75 times zero 250.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,60,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 0>So that would be the expected utility of.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.690
<v Speaker 0>Option B here, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85]}

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 0>And so we can compute this for all the for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.370
<v Speaker 0>all the possible options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, but we already saw that people maybe don't always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.410
<v Speaker 0>look at uh utility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100]}

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.970
<v Speaker 0>So for example, they like certainty even if it might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.410
<v Speaker 0>not be optimal in terms of expected utility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh, also, if we are assuming this, then we're assuming

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 0>that, uh, it's sort of a linear function, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 0>The utility grows linearly with the amount of money.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.940
<v Speaker 0>So that would mean a win of 1000 of £100

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,17,100,94]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.210
<v Speaker 0>a number of assumptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 0>So there's three key ideas that you need to need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 0>to assume.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.570
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, uh, we need to forget this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:49.050
<v Speaker 0>assumption that gains and losses are equally bad, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.450
<v Speaker 0>So, um, this sorry, I'm getting ahead of my time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 0>So this is called loss aversion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, gains diminish more quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100]}

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.890
<v Speaker 0>Uh, losses are more important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 0>So if we draw this as a graph where we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 0>have the outcome here on the x axis and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.010
<v Speaker 0>value on the y axis, then first of all, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.370
<v Speaker 0>see it's not linear, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.730
<v Speaker 0>So the more we gain the less uh value we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.380
<v Speaker 0>attach to it, the less important it becomes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 0>This is the example of if if you have, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,94]}

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 0>if you have 100 million, then, uh, gaining another 10

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,44,96,100,100]}

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.940
<v Speaker 0>million, it's not going to be a big difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 0>So this flattens out rather than being linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.660
<v Speaker 0>If it was just expected utility then this would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.540
<v Speaker 0>a straight line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 0>And on the other hand the losses also flatten out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.660
<v Speaker 0>but less quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:44.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.780
<v Speaker 0>So it's more linear here at least initially for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.500
<v Speaker 0>losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 0>So you can caricature this and say losses hurt more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.220
<v Speaker 0>than gains make you happy right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.860
<v Speaker 0>If you lose the same amount then this hurts more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 0>than winning the same amount makes you happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.260
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume, I don't know, £10 somewhere here, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 0>that makes you happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.300
<v Speaker 0>But uh, it's similar in terms of loss, but £100

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 0>is somewhere here, and the loss of £100 is worse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 0>than the gain of £100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.880
<v Speaker 0>And this is something that's called loss aversion, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,40,100,100,100,95]}

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.240
<v Speaker 0>You try to avoid losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.680
<v Speaker 0>Losses hurt more than than gains make you happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.120
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there's the the fact that they're not not linear,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 0>neither gains or losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise this would be a straight line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.400
<v Speaker 0>So instead it's a curve here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.920
<v Speaker 0>The more you gain or the more you lose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.240
<v Speaker 0>It loses its potency.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100]}

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.000
<v Speaker 0>And then a third assumption that you can't read off

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 0>the the function here is that we overvalue improbable events.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.200
<v Speaker 0>And that's something we will come back to next time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.880 --> 00:38:00.160
<v Speaker 0>that things that are very probable but somehow memorable, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,47,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.560
<v Speaker 0>assign them a higher probability than we actually should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 0>Like plane crashes or winning the lottery?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 0>Really unlikely, but also very shocking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.320
<v Speaker 0>So it's our memory that is playing a role here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 0>and is giving us a and making us overestimate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 0>probability of improbable events.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so how does this work in practice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 0>So first assumption diminishes diminishing value to gains and losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.970
<v Speaker 0>So if U is our utility function and u of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:38.450
<v Speaker 0>X is A is now not the expected value but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 0>the subjective value right for us as human beings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:46.610
<v Speaker 0>Then according to this, a win of £120 minus a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:54.530
<v Speaker 0>loss of £110 is a less a has lower utility

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,67,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:38:55.090 --> 00:39:00.050
<v Speaker 0>than a gain of 20, minus a loss of ten,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.170
<v Speaker 0>a gain of ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.850
<v Speaker 0>This is because these are larger amounts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:05.450
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 0>The difference is £10 in both cases here and here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.530
<v Speaker 0>But here is larger amounts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 0>And if we go back to our curve here then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 0>that means we are somewhere here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 0>So the extra £10 don't make a big difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 0>But if we're looking at the right side of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.540
<v Speaker 0>inequality, then we're somewhere here and the extra £10 make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.380
<v Speaker 0>a difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.820
<v Speaker 0>Because it's not a linear function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 0>So that's one thing that prospect theory assumes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.860
<v Speaker 0>And the other thing is that, as I said, loss

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.980
<v Speaker 0>aversion losses hurt more than gains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.620
<v Speaker 0>So the utility of winning £100 is not the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.300
<v Speaker 0>as the negative utility of losing £100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:47.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.820
<v Speaker 0>So because with a £100 gain, we're somewhere here, let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,79,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.260
<v Speaker 0>say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.540
<v Speaker 0>And with a £100 loss we're somewhere here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,77,100,100]}

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 0>So it's a bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:01.220
<v Speaker 0>Utility than the £100 gain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,100,85,100]}

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.460
<v Speaker 0>And then the improbable events I already mentioned that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.100
<v Speaker 0>So this is why people play lotteries, which is why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 0>people take risky opportunities to avoid losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.160
<v Speaker 0>This is also gamblers have the tendency they've they've lost

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.720
<v Speaker 0>a lot of money and then they take a really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 0>high risk bet to win the money back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.600
<v Speaker 0>Because the losses are the losses hurt much more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.920
<v Speaker 0>than the gains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.520

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Number one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 0>So this is this idea that, um.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.520

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.000
<v Speaker 0>So this is why our function here is not a

<v Speaker 0>linear function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.400
<v Speaker 0>So we will be somewhere up here where we've already

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.000

<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.280
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't make a big difference in terms of our

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.240
<v Speaker 0>So that's correct.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.080
<v Speaker 0>Number two.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.570

<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.010

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.410
<v Speaker 0>you go down from 20 to 10.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.330

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.290

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.450
<v Speaker 0>So that's not correct according to prospect theory.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it is a big deal if you're starting

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:42.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:43.970
<v Speaker 0>So that's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Then the next one.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 0>96%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.690
<v Speaker 0>So losing £200 has a bigger effect than winning to

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 0>£100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 0>This is the loss loss aversion right.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume the £200 are somewhere here then losing

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 0>£200 or somewhere here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100]}

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:05.930
<v Speaker 0>It's it can still get a lot worse right.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 0>So losses hurt more than, than gains.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.700
<v Speaker 0>So that's also true according to prospect theory.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.700
<v Speaker 0>Then number four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you have £1,000, then you are prone to

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.460

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.660
<v Speaker 0>you're prone to take a gamble to to win it

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:33.860
<v Speaker 0>But is this assumption that people overweight improbable events and

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.380
<v Speaker 0>because losses hurt a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.580
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.740
<v Speaker 0>So we've lost £1,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81]}

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, then we're willing to take this gamble even though

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.780
<v Speaker 0>it's it might have a low probability.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.740

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, I'm in a casino, and I play

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.260

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.880

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.080

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.480
<v Speaker 0>So that's also explained by prospect theory and the final

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, that also predicts that people should find sure

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.080
<v Speaker 0>losses even more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.960
<v Speaker 0>Effective than short gains okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,48,100,69]}

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.720
<v Speaker 0>Because first of all, both things, let's assume both things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 0>are certain then, given that losses hurt more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,82,87]}

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 0>Sure, losses are even even worse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.840
<v Speaker 0>So that also follows from prospect theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 0>That was it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 0>So I have a short summary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.690
<v Speaker 0>We looked at rational analysis as a framework for modelling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:16.290
<v Speaker 0>cognition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.490
<v Speaker 0>The idea was basically you work out what would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:20.570
<v Speaker 0>the rational behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.450
<v Speaker 0>So for example in the examples we've seen, the rational

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:27.850
<v Speaker 0>behaviour would be to compute the expected value based on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 0>probability theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:33.330
<v Speaker 0>It turns out that people don't behave in that way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 0>if we give them actual decisions to make.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.250
<v Speaker 0>So rational analysis can be applied to human decision making

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 0>and shows where the two diverge, the actual behaviour and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.050
<v Speaker 0>the the supposed optimal behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.330
<v Speaker 0>And we've looked at some classic experiments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:57.050
<v Speaker 0>So for example, the joint bets that we saw and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.090
<v Speaker 0>the way the problem is framed makes it makes a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 0>big difference, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.650
<v Speaker 0>Whether I give people the expected value or I just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.210
<v Speaker 0>give them the probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.980
<v Speaker 0>We've seen that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.220
<v Speaker 0>Losses and gains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.660
<v Speaker 0>They don't grow linearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 0>They flatten out after a while as the gains get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 0>bigger or the losses get bigger, you care less.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:23.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, losses hurt more than than gains benefit you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.980
<v Speaker 0>So they have a bigger effect than gains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.380
<v Speaker 0>And we tend to overestimate the probability of rare events,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.300
<v Speaker 0>things like train crashes and lottery wins and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 0>And we've seen prospect theory, which I've not made mathematically

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.700
<v Speaker 0>precise, but given you an intuition of how prospect theory

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.460
<v Speaker 0>accounts for that sort of behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 0>And if you look at the article by Trotsky and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,39,92]}

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.900

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.620
<v Speaker 0>They give a lot more examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.820

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.620
<v Speaker 0>any questions.
