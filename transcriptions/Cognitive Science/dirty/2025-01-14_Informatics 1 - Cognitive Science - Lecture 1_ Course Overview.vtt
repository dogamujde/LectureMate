<v Speaker 0>modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 0>But we also introduce all the cognitive material that you

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing research in computational neuroscience.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>So we are, uh, constructing models of brain function, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.310
<v Speaker 2>we're also analysing neural data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100]}

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 2>And I'll be teaching the second half of this course,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.550
<v Speaker 2>which is more leaning towards neuroscience.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 2>So we'll be exploring, um, how the brain works and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 2>what that means for computer science from a neuroscientific perspective.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So for instance, I'm going to teach you how we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 2>see things, how vision works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see how, um, activity in the brain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 2>of neurones relates to artificial neural networks and whether these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 2>are different or similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.030
<v Speaker 2>And some of these are interesting questions which range all

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 2>the way into philosophy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot to discuss there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing you in.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.130
<v Speaker 2>When?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll be starting my part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.890
<v Speaker 0>I'll introduce myself as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 0>Quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.250
<v Speaker 0>So I'm Frank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.330
<v Speaker 0>I'll do the non-euro part of the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.050
<v Speaker 0>That part deals with high level cognitive function, in particular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.170
<v Speaker 0>with language, but also with things like decision making or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.050
<v Speaker 0>categories and concepts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 0>And I'll introduce some of the computational techniques.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 0>Starting actually with neural networks, but also things like Bayesian

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.370
<v Speaker 0>modelling that Mathias will also then pick up in his

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 0>half of the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.330
<v Speaker 0>There's also two teaching assistants, Robin Green and Jordan Schwartz,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,71,100,100,47]}

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.370
<v Speaker 0>who are not here, but who do a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.570
<v Speaker 0>the work behind the scenes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 0>In particular to do with the labs and and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.930
<v Speaker 0>assignment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 0>Let's start with what is cognitive science?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 0>So you might have seen this hexagon before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.980
<v Speaker 0>It's supposed to illustrate the different component disciplines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 0>Things like philosophy and psychology contribute to cognitive science, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 0>also AI, neuroscience, anthropology and linguistics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 0>And they all interact in mysterious ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 0>So that's why there's all these connecting lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.140
<v Speaker 0>In this course, we can't cover all of this, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 0>we can't cover all possible subject areas and all possible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 0>cognitive functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.540
<v Speaker 0>We will focus mostly on this part here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 0>Well, some linguistics as well, and a little bit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,41,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 0>anthropology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 0>Not a lot of philosophy, but the methods are often

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 0>shared with AI and with neuroscience in particular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 0>Matthias part and the experimental aspects that we'll touch upon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.140
<v Speaker 0>are mostly from cognitive psychology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 0>Personally, I think it's better to think in terms of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 0>cognitive functions rather than in terms of disciplines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 0>So the cognitive functions we're going to deal with are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 0>vision, language, memory, decision making, these kind of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 0>And then all the different disciplines, they have aspects to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 0>contribute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 0>For example linguistics obviously if you study language then linguistics

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.720
<v Speaker 0>has a lot to contribute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 0>If you want to model cognitive functions, and AI is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.240
<v Speaker 0>useful because of all the machine learning techniques and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.440
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.480
<v Speaker 0>So as a discipline, you can define cognitive science as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 0>the science of mental representation and processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 0>So representation a representation is a description of information in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.840
<v Speaker 0>the mind in your brain ultimately in biology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 0>And the process is something that goes on in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.599
<v Speaker 0>brain that works with that information without representation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 0>For example, sensory information comes in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.960
<v Speaker 0>It could be auditory information or visual information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.850
<v Speaker 0>And you translate it into some sort of representation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 0>Ultimately an activation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 0>Patterns of neurones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100]}

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.130
<v Speaker 0>And then this representation underpins behaviour in some sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 0>So for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 0>You see something and then you speak for example you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.770
<v Speaker 0>describe what you've seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 0>So there's an action.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.330
<v Speaker 0>There's motor control.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 0>There's an output that's being generated by the cognitive system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.570
<v Speaker 0>And we basically have sensory information being translated to representations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.570
<v Speaker 0>or the other way around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 0>And sometimes we have internal representation for example verbal representations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 0>being translated to numerical representations stuff like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.650
<v Speaker 0>So it's all about representations and the processes that operate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 0>on them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 0>And in this course we're going to look at cognitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.890
<v Speaker 0>science from various angles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.090
<v Speaker 0>So we will see what kind of questions cognitive scientists

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.130
<v Speaker 0>normally ask about representations and cognitive processes what kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 0>data they collect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.380
<v Speaker 0>And this can go from behavioural data, brain imaging data,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.940
<v Speaker 0>neuroscientific data, questionnaires, um, data for models where you generate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,48,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 0>simulations and use those simulations as data, what kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.580
<v Speaker 0>theories they build.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61]}

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 0>And these can be verbal theories, but they can also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.820
<v Speaker 0>be mathematical or numerical.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.460
<v Speaker 0>And then ultimately computational models, algorithms and implementations of algorithms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 0>that simulate cognitive processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 0>So we'll encounter all of this in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 0>And as I said there is an emphasis on computational

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 0>modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about that a lot more on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 0>Why computational modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 0>Why is it not enough to just measure things and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.940
<v Speaker 0>gather data?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.700
<v Speaker 0>I will argue that you can use modelling to evaluate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 0>theories, to generate new hypotheses, and ultimately guide the collection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 0>of new data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.460
<v Speaker 0>So your model predicts something, and then you can gather

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 0>new data to to test that prediction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 0>This will all become a lot less abstract and more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.960
<v Speaker 0>concrete, with lots of examples starting on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay, but let's look at a few examples.

<v Speaker 0>And lots of people have already voted, so let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.690
<v Speaker 0>Well, there's actually evidence that it does get bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.490
<v Speaker 0>In particular, there's a study we'll look at in the

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.450

<v Speaker 0>in navigation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.810
<v Speaker 0>And they found that this is bigger in people who

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
<v Speaker 0>Namely taxi drivers who, you know, navigate for a living

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.250

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 0>Next question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume we're in a culture where we don't

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 0>Can we still deal with quantities.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 0>What do you think.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Well.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.230
<v Speaker 0>Almost everyone is convinced that that's the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.750
<v Speaker 0>And that's the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 0>And again, we'll look at this in more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 0>Uh, in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,99]}

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.870
<v Speaker 0>Think end of towards the end of next week, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 0>where we'll, uh, look at people in a culture called,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 0>uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:27.030
<v Speaker 0>Well, uh, Piranha and the speakers and the members of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 0>this culture, they speak a language that doesn't have a

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 0>number of words, but you can run experiments that show

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.030
<v Speaker 0>that they're still able to count in the sense that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.870
<v Speaker 0>they're able to deal with quantities that can match quantities,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.630
<v Speaker 0>same quantities on each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.830
<v Speaker 0>And so this can be shown experimentally and is a

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:50.040

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 0>other cultures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 0>They learn this counting procedure even though they don't have

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 0>number words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.560
<v Speaker 0>So that's an interesting anthropological fact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.520
<v Speaker 0>And then final questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.520
<v Speaker 0>So a lot of hype at the moment about AI

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.280

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.080
<v Speaker 0>Surely they can learn anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 0>We can learn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.640
<v Speaker 0>What do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.640
<v Speaker 0>Just need a big enough neural network.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>There isn't a clear answer.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.760
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.520
<v Speaker 0>Not surprising.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 0>But if you could tell me in a word or

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.350

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.690
<v Speaker 0>also fun, but obviously you're more interested in the second

<v Speaker 0>Interdisciplinary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 0>It will be very interdisciplinary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.329
<v Speaker 0>There will be some programming of cognitive models.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.330
<v Speaker 0>Next question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.650
<v Speaker 0>this course?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.330
<v Speaker 0>Anything that could be problematic that you're scared of?

<v Speaker 0>There's no essay writing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Okay, cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 0>And, yeah, too much philosophy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100]}

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:21.580
<v Speaker 0>No.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.500
<v Speaker 0>Let's see, what else is there?

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 0>Moving on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.630
<v Speaker 0>So this course, as I've already said, is a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 0>computational.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.110
<v Speaker 0>It's not, you know, it's gentle in terms of the

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.430
<v Speaker 0>computational content.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.750
<v Speaker 0>And I'll talk about that in a moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.150
<v Speaker 0>But it would be useful to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 0>Have you ever used Python before?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.470
<v Speaker 0>You can say lots a fair amount a bit, never.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, most of you have had some exposure to Python.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 0>This is great to make things a bit easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.670
<v Speaker 0>But we'll also provide lots of support for those who

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.830

<v Speaker 0>before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 0>This is actually the next question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.550
<v Speaker 0>Do you have experience with any other programming languages?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.270
<v Speaker 0>Haskell, for example?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.590
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't I don't know why anyone would, but Haskell

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.070

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 0>Any other Experiences?

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.410
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.730
<v Speaker 0>Fantastic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.770
<v Speaker 0>Just Python.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 0>No programming at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.210
<v Speaker 0>5%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.130
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.050
<v Speaker 0>And how about maths?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 0>So there won't be huge amounts of maths in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.170
<v Speaker 0>course, but some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.810
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's say high school level maths is there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 0>So have you done higher or A-level maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.970
<v Speaker 0>Maybe even some maths courses at university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.810
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe not so keen on maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:16.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.450
<v Speaker 0>So most people have seen some math before so that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 0>going to be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.890
<v Speaker 0>As I said it's not going to be super complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 0>And that was it in terms of questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Now I'll tell you a little bit more about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.620
<v Speaker 0>course and about the content, but also about how the

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.540
<v Speaker 0>course will be run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.060
<v Speaker 0>As I said, it's an introduction to cognitive science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 0>Starting from scratch has a computational focus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.660
<v Speaker 0>And why does it say three main parts, two main

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 0>parts?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.980
<v Speaker 0>So the first part is the one before Flexible Learning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.340
<v Speaker 0>week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.660
<v Speaker 0>We're going to talk about language categories which are sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.940

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.820
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if people have to decide between various

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.180
<v Speaker 0>options and they know about the probability of these options,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.900
<v Speaker 0>how do they make a decision under uncertainty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.700
<v Speaker 0>So we'll talk about that as well, which is not

<v Speaker 0>science, for example, in the introduction to cognitive science, which

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.600
<v Speaker 0>then you will recognise some of these things.

<v Speaker 0>the labs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 0>So these are the practical parts of the of the

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.120
<v Speaker 0>So let me briefly try to convince you why modelling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.920
<v Speaker 0>is a good thing and what kind of models you

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 0>will encounter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 0>So sometimes people use model and theory interchangeably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.600
<v Speaker 0>They will talk about, I don't know, a model of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.200
<v Speaker 0>sensory perception or a model of eye movements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 0>And what they actually mean is a theory, a precise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.650
<v Speaker 0>theory that's either written down in mathematical terms or in

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.570
<v Speaker 0>verbal terms, but is precise enough to make testable predictions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.970
<v Speaker 0>This is not what we're going to mean by model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.370
<v Speaker 0>When we say model, we mean something that's actually implemented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:48.530
<v Speaker 0>There's an algorithm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.770
<v Speaker 0>There's an implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.970
<v Speaker 0>It's something you can run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 0>It's simulates the behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,79]}

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.570
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't just describe it, albeit uh, some theories are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,65,100,100,100]}

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.250
<v Speaker 0>very precise and mathematical, but they don't simulate the behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.090
<v Speaker 0>And models can have physical, mathematical and computational aspects to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 0>We'll deal with the computational aspects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 0>So um, I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,60,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 0>This is a robot for example is a type of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.610
<v Speaker 0>model, is a physical model that implements certain interactive behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.410
<v Speaker 0>The robot, of course, needs to interact with its environment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is one of these mathematical models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 0>This is illustrating Stephen's law, uh, which tells you how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.630
<v Speaker 0>the perceived magnitude of the stimulus Um, relates to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.830
<v Speaker 0>physical magnitude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.910
<v Speaker 0>So you have the the perceived magnitude, the magnitude estimate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.670
<v Speaker 0>here on the y axis and the stimulus magnitude, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.790
<v Speaker 0>physical intensity on the y axis and depending on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.430
<v Speaker 0>modality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if you just ask participants to estimate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.070
<v Speaker 0>the length of a line, then the actual length and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 0>the perceived length, they are linearly related.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:59.030 --> 00:23:59.230
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.870
<v Speaker 0>So we have a straight line coefficient of one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.110
<v Speaker 0>But other things like for example estimating the brightness of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:10.590
<v Speaker 0>a light flash, uh, people systematically overestimate the brightness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 0>So the coefficient is smaller than one or an electric

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 0>shock.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, you underestimate the strength.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:23.430
<v Speaker 0>And so the intensity the coefficient is, uh, more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 0>So this tells us basically that there's a clear mathematical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.030
<v Speaker 0>relationship which you can actually write as this simple exponential

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.640
<v Speaker 0>equation here where k is the constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.760
<v Speaker 0>P is the perceived magnitude and s is the intensity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.800
<v Speaker 0>And then there's a modality specific exponent n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 0>So that would be one for line length smaller than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 0>one for brightness and bigger than one for electric shock.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.600
<v Speaker 0>And this is a type of model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.720
<v Speaker 0>And you can easily imagine how to implement this and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.040
<v Speaker 0>simulate the behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88]}

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 0>But in this, at this form, in this form it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.240
<v Speaker 0>just an equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.360
<v Speaker 0>So it can be an artefact like a robot can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.440
<v Speaker 0>be a mathematical equation like Stephen's Law.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,98,100,100,95,100]}

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 0>It can be something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.840
<v Speaker 0>This is the um, the model of eye movement behaviour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,84,100,97]}

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.680
<v Speaker 0>called easy Reader, which takes visual input here and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.880
<v Speaker 0>decides, um, whether to make a saccade, whether to move

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 0>to the next word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040
<v Speaker 0>So this is for reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, and it controls the eye movements in reading and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,56,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:33.900
<v Speaker 0>reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 0>You move from word to word in little jumps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.540
<v Speaker 0>Basically, these are called saccades.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 0>And it tells you here in the motor control part,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.540
<v Speaker 0>whether to make a saccade and jump to the next

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 0>word, or whether to process the next word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 0>So pay attention to the next word, or go to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 0>the word after whether to initiate an attention shift and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:54.980
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 0>So this is sometimes called a box and arrow model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,85,100]}

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to understand the details, but you need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.300
<v Speaker 0>to understand that if people say model they sometimes mean

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.140
<v Speaker 0>something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So in this case there is actually a computational implementation

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.900

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 0>model, which you can run and which will produce a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.740
<v Speaker 0>sequence of fixations and saccades on the page as you

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.580
<v Speaker 0>read write, which you can then compare to human to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 0>human behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86]}

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 0>But the diagram here is this is a model just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 0>as a sequence of boxes and arrows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so these are three different types of models that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 0>we encounter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 0>Then there's models like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 0>There's a neural network of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.790
<v Speaker 0>And you have an input layer a hidden layer, an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 0>output layer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.910
<v Speaker 0>And basically you have a vector of data that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.470
<v Speaker 0>transform into another vector of outputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.710
<v Speaker 0>And there is no theory in the same sense as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.870
<v Speaker 0>there's a theory that's encapsulated here in the, in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 0>boxes in error or in the mathematical formulation like here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.190
<v Speaker 0>But it's really just a mechanism, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.710
<v Speaker 0>It's an architecture, a mechanism that transforms transforms an input

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:12.670
<v Speaker 0>into an output.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 0>So this is also something that people call a model

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.470
<v Speaker 0>and we'll encounter in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.110
<v Speaker 0>In terms of the material that we'll see in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.890
<v Speaker 0>first part of the course, we'll start with an introduction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 0>to language, some facts about words and sentences that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.250
<v Speaker 0>need to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 0>Then we'll talk about language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 0>How do children learn language?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.490
<v Speaker 0>We'll introduce a neural network model of a particular part

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.770
<v Speaker 0>of language acquisition in particular past tense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.890
<v Speaker 0>It's a model of past tense acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.810
<v Speaker 0>Then we talk about speech a little bit in particular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:53.170
<v Speaker 0>works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37]}

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 0>Word segmentation introduce another modelling paradigm and apply that to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:58.850
<v Speaker 0>speech segmentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.130
<v Speaker 0>It's called Bayesian modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,96]}

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.050
<v Speaker 0>It's a form of probabilistic modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about word learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.970
<v Speaker 0>We'll also look at a Bayesian model there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.210
<v Speaker 0>We'll introduce another concept.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.010
<v Speaker 0>Communication efficiency which stems from information theory which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.570
<v Speaker 0>part of computer science, which has also been used as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 0>a tool for modelling cognitive processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about semantics, the meaning of words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 0>In particular, I'll introduce something called vector semantics or word

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:28.810
<v Speaker 0>embeddings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.140
<v Speaker 0>These are essentially derived from neural networks as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Speaker 0>So this goes back to the to the earlier part

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 0>of the course here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.820
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll talk about categories and decision making and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.020
<v Speaker 0>biases in decision making in particular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 0>And also about how to model these computationally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 0>We'll go back to actually the Bayesian modelling paradigm here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.500
<v Speaker 0>So as you can see it's a mixture of topics,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.980
<v Speaker 0>in this case mostly in the realm of language and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.180
<v Speaker 0>modelling paradigms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 0>In the literature there's a bunch of different modelling paradigms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.700
<v Speaker 0>and they're suitable in different situations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.500
<v Speaker 0>And this is something you hopefully will get out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 0>the course that there's an array of tools, and you'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.380
<v Speaker 0>learn how to how to use these tools and when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:20.540
<v Speaker 0>they are applicable, then in Mathias part, it's more about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,49,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 0>the neural foundations of cognition, particularly talking about memory, vision,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.020
<v Speaker 0>and neural computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.670
<v Speaker 0>Starting a little bit with brain anatomy and brain function,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.950
<v Speaker 0>talking about individual neurones, how you would model at that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 0>level.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:37.150
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.550
<v Speaker 0>So there's different modelling paradigms that are appropriate at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.350
<v Speaker 0>neural level.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.430
<v Speaker 0>How you record data, how you record neural activity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.670
<v Speaker 0>This is quite different from when you're studying language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.550
<v Speaker 0>And you can, uh, you know, get people to produce

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 0>sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.590
<v Speaker 0>And this is your data here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 0>You can record from the brain or you can use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:00.510
<v Speaker 0>brain imaging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, he will talk quite a lot about vision and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.950
<v Speaker 0>the relationship between vision and memory, uh, looking at various

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 0>modelling paradigms again, for example, hope filled networks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.510
<v Speaker 0>So this is also called auto associative memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.710
<v Speaker 0>It's a paradigm that in particular is used to model

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:23.190
<v Speaker 0>visual memory and reinforcement learning, which is another modelling paradigm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 0>will also be be touched upon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.010
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, let's talk a little bit about how the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.810
<v Speaker 0>course is run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Speaker 0>So this course is suitable for outside students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 0>And most of you are at least half of you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.770
<v Speaker 0>are not Informatics students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.370
<v Speaker 0>There will be some programming in Python, in the assignments

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 0>and in the labs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you've taken the introduction to cognitive science, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.730
<v Speaker 0>will have had some programming exposure informatics one day as

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.050
<v Speaker 0>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.730
<v Speaker 0>Some maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 0>But as I said, don't be.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.570
<v Speaker 0>Don't be scared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.090
<v Speaker 0>The maths will not be very difficult.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.810
<v Speaker 0>year before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>This particular incarnation didn't have an exam last year.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.220

<v Speaker 0>changed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.380
<v Speaker 0>And so the the questions are still relevant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.740

<v Speaker 3>Neuroscience focus or coding focus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,95,83]}

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:52.060

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.420

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.340
<v Speaker 0>The coding is assessed through through the assignment.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.940

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 0>So it will be multiple choice questions and short answer

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,61,35]}

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, so for each lecture, I'm setting between 1 or

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.000

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.440

<v Speaker 0>Uh, no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.840

<v Speaker 0>the lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.040
<v Speaker 0>But if you want more background, if you want additional

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.590
<v Speaker 0>For example, if you formulate this in terms of the

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.110
<v Speaker 0>area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:46.270
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:50.150
<v Speaker 0>So you should go for more pizza in the sense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 0>of more area of pizza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.150
<v Speaker 0>And of course, we can work this out because we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.670
<v Speaker 0>know the diameter of the pizza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 0>And then we know that the area of the 12

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:06.950
<v Speaker 0>inch pizzas is 226in², and the area of the single

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:11.320
<v Speaker 0>large pizza is 154 inch squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,90,90]}

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 0>So the large pizza is actually the better deal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.920
<v Speaker 0>If all you care about is area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.840
<v Speaker 0>And so what's going on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Most people probably will have thought the two small pizzas

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.720
<v Speaker 0>are are better, but what's going on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.920
<v Speaker 0>Why is um, you know, is your pizza place trying

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.880
<v Speaker 0>to deceive you or what's going on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.440
<v Speaker 0>Why are you trying to sell you these two small

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.960
<v Speaker 0>pizzas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.400
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, why do people think that it's a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.840
<v Speaker 0>better deal most of the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Speaker 0>And that's something we will talk about next time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 0>And, um, the answer behaviourally the answer is simply that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,71,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 0>people are bad at estimating areas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.200
<v Speaker 0>They're good at estimating lengths and linear quantities, but they're

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.920
<v Speaker 0>bad at estimating areas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.200
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but that's obviously just an observation and description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.560
<v Speaker 0>This is not an explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.690
<v Speaker 0>So why are they bad at estimating areas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.090
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, would building a computational model be useful

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 0>in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.050
<v Speaker 0>And that's one of the things we're going to talk

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 0>about on Thursday.

<v Speaker 0>more.
