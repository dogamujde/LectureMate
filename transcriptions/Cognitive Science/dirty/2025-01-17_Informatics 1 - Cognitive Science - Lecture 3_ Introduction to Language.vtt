WEBVTT

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, don't forget to sign up for book club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,48,100]}

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 0>Uh, it's a different barcode every time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 0>So if you could just scan the barcode for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 0>interactive elements of the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 0>While you do that, I can tell you roughly what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 0>today's lecture will be about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 0>It will be about language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so, as I said, there will be several large

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 0>themes in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 0>So that includes language, but later on also vision, memory,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 0>Various aspects of neural cognition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 0>And we'll start with the language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 0>So we saw yesterday a sort of general introduction to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 0>various themes in cognitive science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 0>In particular we talked about modelling, but then we also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 0>talked about this question of whether our cognitive faculties are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 0>innate or to what extent they are innate rather than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 0>acquired or learned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 0>And this is a question that looms large when it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 0>comes to language as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 0>We saw yesterday a bit of evidence about a critical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 0>period for language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 0>That would be evidence that the maintenance camp normally sites

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 0>as an argument for maintenance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 0>But we'll see other evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 0>And today we'll talk about language as a system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 0>If you if you're studying linguistics or you've taken a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 0>linguistics class already, then this will all seem very familiar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 0>But obviously I'm not assuming that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 0>So I'm introducing some basic concepts, in particular words and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 0>rules and how they interact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 0>And then in the next lecture on Tuesday, we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 0>to talk about language acquisition specifically and what kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 0>aspects of language acquisition acquisition we would like to model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 0>So there we're going to talk about things like regular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 0>versus irregular verbs and how this sort of system can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 0>be acquired during acquisition and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 0>And after that we'll look at modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 0>This is the first modelling part which will be about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 0>neural network modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 0>That will take us 2 or 3 lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll apply this to language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 0>So we'll introduce a neural network model of language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 0>That will not be until lecture three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 0>But that's sort of the overall game plan for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 0>first part of the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.710
<v Speaker 0>So let's get started with language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 0>Words and rules are the most important components I'll talk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 0>about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 0>And then I'll talk about anatomy of language more generally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 0>And also how this relates to the anatomy of cognition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.040
<v Speaker 0>and in wider terms, just beyond language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what is the word?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 0>This is a fairly intuitive thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 0>And you have seen written words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 0>Heard spoken words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, a linguist would define it abstractly as an association

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.840
<v Speaker 0>between, uh, form and meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,49,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 0>So typically a spoken form such as rose would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,99,100]}

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 0>associated with the certain meaning referring to objects that look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,44,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.880
<v Speaker 0>roughly like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay, we'll come back to meaning actually later in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.760
<v Speaker 0>course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 0>At the moment, let's just say there's this arbitrary association.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 0>Typically you would have other properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 0>You would know that it's a noun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920
<v Speaker 0>For example, you know, the part of speech.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 0>You would know, for example, that it's um, a concrete

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 0>object rather than an abstract noun, like, I don't know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 0>democracy or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, so somehow the language community, in this case, speakers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 0>of English, they have agreed on mapping this particular set

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 0>of phonemes rose onto this particular object, and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.940
<v Speaker 0>conventional.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 0>This is arbitrary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.940
<v Speaker 0>The rose doesn't really.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 0>The word rose doesn't really smell like a rose, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 0>looks like a rose, or have thorns and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 0>It's a conventional pairing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.660
<v Speaker 0>And you might say, well, but what about words like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 0>oink and crash that sound a bit like the thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.300
<v Speaker 0>that they're describing or sound symbolism?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.500
<v Speaker 0>Things like mellifluous or rancorous, which also symbolise a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,100,100,95,100,98]}

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 0>bit what they are denoting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 0>Sure, these pockets exist in the lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 0>There are some, uh, omnium onomatopoeia, as it's called, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,100,83,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 0>some sound symbolism, but most words are not like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we'll ignore this for the for the purposes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 0>of this, this lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 0>This all goes back to the sorcerer, who was a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,30,27,100,100,98]}

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 0>Swiss linguist and who came up with this idea of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 0>the arbitrary sine, the arbitrary pairing between a sequence of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 0>letters or a sequence of phonemes and, uh, a concept,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.550
<v Speaker 0>a meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 0>And if we look at the overall set of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 0>these pairings, then this is called the mental lexicon.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 0>It's a bit like a dictionary, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,100,100]}

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 0>It lists words and meanings, but we're talking about the

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 0>way this is stored in the cognitive system ultimately in

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.110

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 0>So this is called the mental lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.830
<v Speaker 0>And we'll talk a little bit about how this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 0>different or similar compared to a dictionary.

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 0>Something that a linguist would come up with.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.890
<v Speaker 0>Often the structure is actually assumed to be a hierarchy

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.970

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.370
<v Speaker 0>Alphabetical list of words or something like that.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.730
<v Speaker 0>And also you can then define a language as.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 0>A system where two speakers can understand each other because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 0>the lexical entries are the same or at least intelligible

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.610
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 0>Obviously you have different dialects, different accents, different variants of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 0>of of a language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 0>But if there's enough lexical overlap, then the speakers can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.290
<v Speaker 0>understand each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay, here's here's an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually taken from the AI literature.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100]}

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.090
<v Speaker 0>This is something called WordNet which is a lexical hierarchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.730
<v Speaker 0>So it's a type of a lexicon not necessarily a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.370
<v Speaker 0>mental lexicon, but something that is not just a list

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 0>of words like in the dictionary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,60,100]}

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 0>And you can see certain interesting things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.380
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, it's organised as a tree Essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 0>And you have general concepts here like animal or artefact

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 0>up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.900
<v Speaker 0>And then animal will be subdivided into, uh, vertebrate, aquatic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,63,79,100]}

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 0>vertebrate, aquatic invertebrate and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 0>Vertebrate would be bird, mammal and mammal with the human,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,85,100]}

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 0>mouse and sperm whale and a lot of other mammals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 0>And actually a group of linguists have sat down and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.740
<v Speaker 0>painfully constructed this hierarchy for basically all the nouns and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 0>verbs of English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.860
<v Speaker 0>So it contains tens of thousands of words ordered in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.700
<v Speaker 0>this hierarchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 0>And you can see various interesting things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, it's not really a tree.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 0>It's multiple trees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 0>So the artefact hierarchy is different from the animal hierarchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 0>And they're not connected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, you can have ambiguity for example here mouse this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.060
<v Speaker 0>is the mammal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100]}

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 0>And this is another mouse which is the device computer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 0>mouse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 0>And so that is a feature of the mental lexicon,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 0>of course, as well that there's ambiguities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 0>What kind of more than one meaning you can have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 0>cross classification here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 0>The whale here is both a fish and a mammal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's actually a graph rather than tree, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 0>structure that's underlying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 0>And a lot of the cognitive literature assumes that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.760
<v Speaker 0>mental lexicon is organised into something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 0>Either a graph or a tree or a hierarchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.920
<v Speaker 0>It's not just a list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, words that are similar in meaning are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 0>close together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.919
<v Speaker 0>So here are all the all the mammals are close

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 0>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 0>Then all the fish are close together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.360
<v Speaker 0>Here are the artefacts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,58,100,94]}

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.880
<v Speaker 0>They sit in a similar part of the hierarchy and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.280
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually a very important observation because it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 0>influences, for example, how we access the lexicon, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 0>If we access car, then we can access aircraft as

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 0>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 0>Because they're both vehicles, they're both artefacts and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.610
<v Speaker 0>They're semantically similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100]}

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come back to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.010
<v Speaker 0>We'll come back to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:08.530
<v Speaker 0>When we talk about semantic similarity in, I think it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 0>week four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.490
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come back to that in the second part

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.250
<v Speaker 0>of the course, where we'll actually see an example of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.210
<v Speaker 0>how the mental lexicon maps onto the organisation of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.890
<v Speaker 0>cortex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 0>The the neural structure of the brain turns out to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 0>be mapped in a similar way, where words that have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.250
<v Speaker 0>a similar meaning are close together also in terms of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.770
<v Speaker 0>which neurones they're stored in, in the brain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.730
<v Speaker 0>So the the way things are organised matters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 0>This is just an example of how this can be

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.490
<v Speaker 0>conceptualised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 0>There's other interesting things about the mental lexicon if we

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.770
<v Speaker 0>think now, not about the structure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is about the structure of the mental lexicon,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 0>how it's organised, which was a close together, which was

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.140

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.460
<v Speaker 0>But now how do we use the mental lexicon?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.420
<v Speaker 0>How do we use it to recognise words, to produce

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.380
<v Speaker 0>words, to put them together into sentences and so on.

<v Speaker 0>So first of all, we need to learn these words,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.700
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 0>So even if we're Chomsky and we believe that language

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 0>But it's clear that the lexicon is different and it's

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.860

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.840

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.720

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.400

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 0>but initially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.160
<v Speaker 0>So for the first 12 months, babies don't speak right.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.640

<v Speaker 0>to speak.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.000
<v Speaker 0>So they start speaking between 12 and 18 months, and

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 0>then once they reach a milestone of about two years,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 0>then they suddenly start learning lots and lots and lots

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.320

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 0>This is sometimes called the vocabulary explosion or the vocabulary

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 0>growth spurt.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.960
<v Speaker 0>And that's something we'll come back to next week.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, and after that, language acquisition slows down, or at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.280

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.320
<v Speaker 0>While these growth spurt happens, though, often a single exposure

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.960

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 0>So somehow we have a very efficient mechanism for learning

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.690
<v Speaker 0>words, at least at this particular age, and we end

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.290
<v Speaker 0>up learning lots of words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.010
<v Speaker 0>40,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 0>That's what the estimate is here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:58.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.370
<v Speaker 0>This is what I've just said, this vocabulary explosion that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,47,100,100,100]}

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 0>happens during the second year after birth, roughly between, let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 0>say, 18 and 30 months, something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.850
<v Speaker 0>Then if we think about how we use words, right,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.610
<v Speaker 0>we we hear a word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.090
<v Speaker 0>If someone speaks to us or several words or we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.730
<v Speaker 0>read a word on the page, then we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 0>access it in the mental lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise we don't know the meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 0>We don't know what part of speech we're dealing with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.930
<v Speaker 0>We don't know how to fit this in in the

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 0>rest of the sentence and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.090
<v Speaker 0>So we need to access the mental lexicon somehow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 0>And here the estimate is that this happens really quickly.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 0>It takes about 200 milliseconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.530
<v Speaker 0>So this is, you know, a fifth of a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.570

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:55.710
<v Speaker 0>And then the estimate is if you, um, if you

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.790
<v Speaker 0>retrieve, if you read or hear a word and then

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 0>retrieve that meaning, and then also you're asked to name

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 0>This is a common task that psycho linguists use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,58,100,100]}

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.270
<v Speaker 0>They show you a word and they ask you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.790
<v Speaker 0>name it, or they show you a picture and name

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.710
<v Speaker 0>And so you take about a quarter of a second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 0>to name the object, and then a quarter, another quarter

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.550

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.430
<v Speaker 0>Because speaking of course, means that you need to send

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of other stuff going on when you

<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.310
<v Speaker 0>And cognitive scientists are, of course, interested in studying all

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.470
<v Speaker 0>these different phases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.190
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.750

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100]}

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 0>And then, if you're supposed to speak it.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.000

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.560
<v Speaker 0>to measure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 0>or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 0>But then things accelerate pretty quickly and then by the

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 0>time they're two years old here, they already produce just

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.540
<v Speaker 0>over 300 words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.340
<v Speaker 0>And then by, uh, by the time they're two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.500

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.980

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.660

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.420
<v Speaker 0>So what we can see is that this is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.540
<v Speaker 0>process that basically if you look at the blue curve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.100
<v Speaker 0>or here, the green curve accelerates really, really quickly.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.460
<v Speaker 0>And this is why we end up with the 40,000

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 0>words that we we learn ultimately.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.340
<v Speaker 0>And later in the course we'll talk about the mechanisms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 0>that underlie this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 0>How is it possible to learn so quickly?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.910
<v Speaker 0>It's a tremendous feat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.790
<v Speaker 0>Children in this age, they you know, they also learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.230
<v Speaker 0>other stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.270
<v Speaker 0>For example, they learn how to how to walk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 0>At about 12 months, they learn social interaction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 0>They learn things like gaze following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.430
<v Speaker 0>How do all of these things interact, uh, to produce

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100]}

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.830
<v Speaker 0>this vocabulary, uh, vocabulary explosion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,100,100]}

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.390
<v Speaker 0>So this is something we'll come back to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 0>So but words are of course, not everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.990
<v Speaker 0>We don't talk in isolated words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 0>I mean, obviously we can have utterances like stop or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 0>no that are just a single word, but most utterances

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.430
<v Speaker 0>are not like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.910
<v Speaker 0>They're long and complicated and contain multiple phrases that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 0>nested with each other and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.270
<v Speaker 0>So most speech is is not isolated words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,92,70,100,100,100]}

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 0>So we can combine them into phrases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.810
<v Speaker 0>So a phrase would be something like the blue dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 0>Or, uh, learning to fly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so combinations of words that belong together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.770
<v Speaker 0>And then we combine those phrases into sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 0>A sentence normally has at least a noun phrase and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.210
<v Speaker 0>a verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.490
<v Speaker 0>So something like Peter and Mary, where Peter is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 0>noun phrase and Mary would be a verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.569
<v Speaker 0>And the question is how do these combinations work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, then how do we compute the meaning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.850
<v Speaker 0>of a sentence based on the words and their combination,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 0>the way they are arranged?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,70,100]}

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.810
<v Speaker 0>And if we think about this for a moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 0>So here are three different sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.170
<v Speaker 0>The boy saw the girl with a telescope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 0>The girl saw the telescope with the boy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.730
<v Speaker 0>The boy with the telescope saw the girl.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.970
<v Speaker 0>These all contain the same words, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 0>They are arranged in a different order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.500
<v Speaker 0>Do they mean the same thing or do they mean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100]}

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.220
<v Speaker 0>different things?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.500
<v Speaker 0>What is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,93,100]}

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.420
<v Speaker 0>They all mean different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:49.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 0>So here the boy sees the girl.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,96,100]}

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 0>Here the girl sees the telescope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.860
<v Speaker 0>And here the telescope is somehow associated with the girl.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.780
<v Speaker 0>All with the seeing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,98,100]}

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 0>And here the boy is associated with the telescope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,64,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.700
<v Speaker 0>And here the telescope is associated with the boy, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.060
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 0>So they're all different in terms of the meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.900
<v Speaker 0>And we can create these differences just by shuffling the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 0>words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:11.980
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 0>We keep the words the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 0>We just change the order and we get a different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 0>meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.620
<v Speaker 0>So that means that we can combine words into phrases

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.980
<v Speaker 0>and phrases into sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 0>And how we do that really matters for the message

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.100
<v Speaker 0>that we're trying to convey.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.820
<v Speaker 0>So let's try to understand that a little bit more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.540
<v Speaker 0>So this set of rules that are used to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.350
<v Speaker 0>Combine words and and construct sentences is sometimes called a

<v Speaker 0>grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.190
<v Speaker 0>And here we'll briefly introduce it by a particular kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,60,60,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 0>of formalism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.910
<v Speaker 0>For a modelling grammar it's called the context free grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,82,98,100,99,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 0>And you can think of the context free grammar as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 0>a set of rules that are written as little trees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 0>So you can have trees like this with which indicates

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 0>that rows is a noun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54,100,100,100]}

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 0>So you have the part of speech here, and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.590
<v Speaker 0>you have the lexical item here a is a determiner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.990
<v Speaker 0>Determiner is a type of article, is is a is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.670
<v Speaker 0>a verb.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 0>And so you have these very simple grammar rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.750
<v Speaker 0>And you can think of them as trees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.870
<v Speaker 0>Well trees with only one branch, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.670
<v Speaker 0>In this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.790
<v Speaker 0>But we can have more complicated trees like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.190
<v Speaker 0>This is a noun phrase and P stands for noun

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 0>phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.310
<v Speaker 0>And the noun phrase consists of a determiner and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.710
<v Speaker 0>noun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.330
<v Speaker 0>So determiner is something like a or the a noun

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,75,98,100]}

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.890
<v Speaker 0>would be something like rose or dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 0>A verb phrase contains a verb and a noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 0>Note that this is the same noun phrase as here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:47.450
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 0>So you can have, uh, phrases constructed out of phrases,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.650
<v Speaker 0>or you can have a sentence which consists of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.050
<v Speaker 0>noun phrase on the verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,74,100,100]}

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 0>And again, these combination rules here are written as little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:00.770
<v Speaker 0>trees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 0>And now we already have a grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 0>And we can actually construct a lot of sentences already

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.050
<v Speaker 0>with this, uh, six rule grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.410
<v Speaker 0>And how do we do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.290
<v Speaker 0>Well, we use a process called parsing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.330
<v Speaker 0>Parsing is basically technically it's taking a sentence and applying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.490
<v Speaker 0>a grammar to construct a representation for the sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.690
<v Speaker 0>So let's take this really simple sentence A rose is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 0>a rose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.490
<v Speaker 0>We only have one noun, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.290
<v Speaker 0>So rose occurs twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.090
<v Speaker 0>Then we start with these rules here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.890
<v Speaker 0>These are sometimes called lexical rules, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.300
<v Speaker 0>They have the lexical item and then the part of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 0>speech.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.380
<v Speaker 0>So A is a terminal rose is a noun, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,95,100,100,100,99]}

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.500
<v Speaker 0>is a verb, the other a is a determiner again,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.060
<v Speaker 0>and then the next rose is also noun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 0>So we start basically bottom up, sometimes called bottom up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.780
<v Speaker 0>parsing, and assign a rule to each of the lexical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 0>items, which tells us which part of speech we're using.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.940
<v Speaker 0>And then we can use these rules here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.660
<v Speaker 0>The the rules that don't have lexical items in them,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 0>the phrasal rules and construct these phrases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 0>So this becomes a noun phrase determiner noun combined to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,91,100]}

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.020
<v Speaker 0>a noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:17.900
<v Speaker 0>Same here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.900
<v Speaker 0>It's a noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100]}

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.220
<v Speaker 0>And then we can use this rule here and combine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.100
<v Speaker 0>the verb and the noun phrase into a verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 0>And finally, this use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88]}

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 0>This rule here can combine the determiner so the noun

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.940
<v Speaker 0>phrase and the verb phrase into a sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now we have a complete tree for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.680
<v Speaker 0>sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.120
<v Speaker 0>And in order to we know that we're finished because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 0>we have one tree that spans the whole input, all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.640
<v Speaker 0>the words in the sentence, and it ends in S,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.560
<v Speaker 0>it generates a sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:53.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 0>And now you can imagine that this works for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 0>simple sentence like a rose is a rose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.800
<v Speaker 0>But for more complicated sentence you need a lot more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.120
<v Speaker 0>rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 0>You need more lexical items, you need more ways to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.960
<v Speaker 0>combine them, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay, but in principle, this is a very general and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.120
<v Speaker 0>very powerful mechanism that you can use to construct a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
<v Speaker 0>sentence sentence structures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.560
<v Speaker 0>Let's actually look at this a little bit on Wall

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.040
<v Speaker 0>Club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.560
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't scanned the barcode now's the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Speaker 0>Give you a few more seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.170
<v Speaker 0>So let's think a little bit about the the ideas

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 0>we've just seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 0>So something I haven't talked about is ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.210
<v Speaker 0>So ambiguity means that a word can have more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.810
<v Speaker 0>one meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100]}

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.570
<v Speaker 0>So we saw for example, a mouse could be a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.650
<v Speaker 0>computer device or a mammal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 0>But sentences can also be ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.690
<v Speaker 0>A single sentence can have more than one meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 0>And here are some examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100]}

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.490
<v Speaker 0>And I want you to look at these examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:33.890
<v Speaker 0>They're all ambiguous and think about the words in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.430
<v Speaker 0>in this the sentence in each of the sentences and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 0>tell me whether there's an ambiguous word in the sentence,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.310
<v Speaker 0>and that's what's causing the whole sentence to be ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 0>So you're supposed to pick the ones that contain ambiguous

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,47,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.790
<v Speaker 0>words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.070
<v Speaker 1>As opposed to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,86,88]}

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.150
<v Speaker 0>Them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.710
<v Speaker 0>So the sentences are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.630
<v Speaker 0>I saw her duck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,95]}

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.750
<v Speaker 0>I wrote a black horse in red pyjamas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.910
<v Speaker 0>I saw the boy sitting on a bench with glasses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,71,88,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 0>She's looking for a match.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

<v Unknown>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Unknown>How about that one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,86,84,31]}

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.920
<v Unknown>The second.

<v Speaker 1>Week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32]}

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.840
<v Speaker 0>I thought.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,85]}

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's discuss the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.280
<v Speaker 0>First of all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 0>Let's see the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.660
<v Speaker 0>Majority thinks that everything about sentence two is basically caused

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 0>by ambiguous lexical items.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.220
<v Speaker 0>Correct answer is one, four, and five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's discuss each of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.820
<v Speaker 0>So I saw her duck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what's the ambiguous word here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.060
<v Speaker 0>Which word has two lexical entries here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.740
<v Speaker 0>What do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 0>It's duck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.740
<v Speaker 0>Right, because duck can be the animal, or it can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:05.420
<v Speaker 0>be the, uh, this motion of going down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.700
<v Speaker 0>So clearly this is a duck that belongs to someone

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.380
<v Speaker 0>or this is someone who's ducking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh, second one was I wrote a black horse in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 0>the red pyjamas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83]}

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.420
<v Speaker 0>So there isn't anything ambiguous here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.220
<v Speaker 0>The words are not ambiguous, but it's the in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 0>red pyjamas that's ambiguous, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,98]}

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.700
<v Speaker 0>This could be referring to the horse wearing the red

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.940
<v Speaker 0>pyjamas, or could refer to the speaker to the eye

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 0>Similar situation here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.550
<v Speaker 0>I saw the boy sitting on the bench with glasses

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.190
<v Speaker 0>so the glasses could refer to the bench, or they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.230
<v Speaker 0>could refer to the boy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.310
<v Speaker 0>Obviously not very plausible with the bench.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 0>So one reading is possible, but it's this preferred question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,65,100,100]}

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Ambiguous because you could be like holding it could be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,81,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 1>wearing it could be next to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.870
<v Speaker 0>That's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.030
<v Speaker 0>So the question was that width could be ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.070
<v Speaker 0>I guess that's another type of ambiguity here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.670
<v Speaker 0>The truth is that most English words are ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's actually hard to find examples where there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 0>really no ambiguity going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 0>So with could be uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,99,83]}

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.370
<v Speaker 0>Referring to different manners of being close to someone or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 0>something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:31.730
<v Speaker 0>That's a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 0>She's looking for a match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.730
<v Speaker 0>What is the ambiguity here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 0>So it's kind of about the the worst part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,93,94,28,63]}

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:40.730
<v Speaker 0>Please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Unknown>I think it's maybe ambiguous in its meaning, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,89,100,100,100]}

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Unknown>can't confuse it with another word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Unknown>There's no other word for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,64]}

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>With like that has two definitions, but it only has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,70]}

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.570
<v Speaker 2>like one situation leaves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,22]}

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like the meaning is different, but it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.330
<v Speaker 2>used as completely different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the verb in the knowledge?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,88,89,88]}

00:27:58.690 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 0>That is a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.610
<v Speaker 0>So even if we assume with this, ambiguity is ambiguous,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,96,100]}

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 0>the ambiguity is different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 0>Duck is, as you said, it's ambiguous between the noun

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.610
<v Speaker 0>and the verb.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:15.970
<v Speaker 0>Here the ambiguity is in match, but match is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 0>This is the with type of ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:19.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 0>Match could be, I don't know, playing a match or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 0>someone who matches with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 0>They're both nouns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.770
<v Speaker 0>So we don't have the part of speech ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 0>It's a semantic ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:29.780
<v Speaker 0>And here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.220
<v Speaker 0>Parking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:30.580
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.420
<v Speaker 0>What's going on here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.860
<v Speaker 0>What's the ambiguous thing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 0>So it's a bit more complicated here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 0>I mean, obviously, this could be a traffic warden and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.820
<v Speaker 0>tells you parking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.300
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 0>So they're giving you a fine and then parking fine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.140
<v Speaker 0>is a compound noun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 0>Or it could be your mate helping you into the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.340
<v Speaker 0>into the parking spot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.380
<v Speaker 0>And they say parking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 0>Fine, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.980
<v Speaker 0>So they're telling you that you parked really well, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 0>then fine is a separate word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.420
<v Speaker 0>It's an adverb or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.740
<v Speaker 0>So here it depends really on the discourse context and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.940
<v Speaker 0>how you say it, what kind of meaning you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 0>So yeah, I mean I'll skip this because we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.380
<v Speaker 0>basically discussed this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 0>So here these are the same sentences again.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.950
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm asking about which ambiguity is caused by,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.990
<v Speaker 0>uh, by the, the rules rather than than the words

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,98,40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.150
<v Speaker 0>and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.230
<v Speaker 0>I was too fast here.

<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.350
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 0>So here it's these two ambiguities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.870
<v Speaker 0>The remaining ones are so-called syntactic ambiguities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.070
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 0>Where different rules are used to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 0>In one case, uh, the the prepositional phrase in red

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.150
<v Speaker 0>pyjamas would be attached to the horse.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.950
<v Speaker 0>In the other case, it would be attached to eye

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 0>to the subject.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 0>And here it's a similar ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,74,86,100,100]}

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 0>So here we are assuming the same words, the same

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.770
<v Speaker 0>lexical entries, but they are combined in different ways.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.050
<v Speaker 0>So we assume we're using different rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:35.850
<v Speaker 0>So the first case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.490
<v Speaker 0>This case here is called lexical ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.130
<v Speaker 0>And the second case here is called syntactic ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 0>So two forms of creating more than one meaning.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay I have another quick one.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.250
<v Speaker 0>So let's try to connect things a little bit.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 0>Yesterday I talked about cognitive modelling.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.090
<v Speaker 0>And now let's think about our grammar rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.250

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.490
<v Speaker 0>Are they part of a framework.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 0>Are they part of a theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.170
<v Speaker 0>Would there be a specification implementation hypothesis data.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.010

<v Speaker 0>If I take a grammar rule like PNP goes to

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 0>Where does this fall in in the taxonomy that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.580
<v Speaker 0>So take a few moments to think about this and

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:32.940

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 0>I know.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.640
<v Speaker 0>So about half of you think it's a specification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:47.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's look through the the answers in, uh, bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,96,100]}

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.240
<v Speaker 0>by bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.560
<v Speaker 0>So is it a framework?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.800
<v Speaker 0>Mm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.440
<v Speaker 0>Could be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it could be part of a wider framework

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.880
<v Speaker 0>because this idea that cognition is simple manipulation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.200
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.560
<v Speaker 0>That you take bits of maths or bits of notation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.360
<v Speaker 0>and you shuffle symbols around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.360
<v Speaker 0>That is actually a very old idea in cognitive science

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.200
<v Speaker 0>going back to the 50s and 60s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.400
<v Speaker 0>And obviously this is what's going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.240
<v Speaker 0>You take a symbol like N and VP and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.160
<v Speaker 0>combine and manipulate these symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.930
<v Speaker 0>So overall this is probably part of this wider framework

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.450
<v Speaker 0>of cognition as symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100]}

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.210
<v Speaker 0>However, here I've asked about an individual rule and that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.330
<v Speaker 0>on its own doesn't consider consists constitute a framework or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 0>a theory as such, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93]}

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.450
<v Speaker 0>Even a grammar with lots of rules would not be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.010
<v Speaker 0>a theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:45.450
<v Speaker 0>As such, you would need to link it to behaviour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.330
<v Speaker 0>in some way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.770
<v Speaker 0>You would, for example, need to say I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 0>Long rules are harder to process and take more time,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.130 --> 00:34:00.130
<v Speaker 0>or infrequent words are more difficult to acquire and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.770
<v Speaker 0>learn them later in life and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 0>So they would need to be some connection to cognition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.169
<v Speaker 0>It cannot just be a list of lexical items and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.570
<v Speaker 0>and words specification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:10.929
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.370
<v Speaker 0>So that's pretty close I think, because it does specify

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.889
<v Speaker 0>pretty precisely what you want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:17.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.050
<v Speaker 0>In this case, constructing a noun phrase by taking a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.850
<v Speaker 0>determinant a noun and combining them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 0>So it's a bit like writing it down as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 0>formula or writing it down verbally, but in a in

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.350
<v Speaker 0>a very precise way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.830
<v Speaker 0>Implementation maybe could be an implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.230
<v Speaker 0>You could put this onto a computer or a computer,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,72,100,100]}

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.470
<v Speaker 0>obviously parts programming languages all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.310
<v Speaker 0>So they're actually good at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.830
<v Speaker 0>And programming languages are specified by grammars similar to those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.629
<v Speaker 0>So they're very good at taking a grammar and taking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 0>some input and building up a syntax tree.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 0>So it could be the basis of an implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.470
<v Speaker 0>But as such it isn't an implementation yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.629
<v Speaker 0>It's not really hypothesis or data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.310
<v Speaker 0>Data would be something that I need to get from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 0>So specification was the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.270
<v Speaker 0>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.230
<v Speaker 0>So this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 0>Yes I'll come back to that.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.960

<v Speaker 0>So a tree with just one branch or a larger,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,94,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 0>bigger tree with two branches.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 0>And these are often written as rules like this n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.680
<v Speaker 0>goes to rows where n is the the parent node

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 0>and rows the child node or s goes to NP,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.040
<v Speaker 0>where's is the parent node, and NP and V are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.480
<v Speaker 0>the children okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 0>So this is notionally equivalent if you want to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,65,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.640
<v Speaker 0>a tree in a compact way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.200
<v Speaker 0>So this is the whole tree for the sentence that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.760
<v Speaker 0>we've seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.720
<v Speaker 0>You sometimes see this in terms of um this labelled

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,62]}

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.840
<v Speaker 0>bracket notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.920
<v Speaker 0>So you can use the arrows only for trees of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.160
<v Speaker 0>depth one right where there's just one parent and one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.560
<v Speaker 0>or multiple children, but there aren't any grandchildren or grandparents.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 0>So you would write this as a label, as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 0>sequence of labelled brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100]}

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 0>So here this bracket means that this is the sentence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,55,81,100]}

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.260
<v Speaker 0>starting this bracket means it's the noun phrase starting the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 0>determiner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 0>Then closing bracket denotes the end of the phrase, end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.780
<v Speaker 0>of the determiner, end of the noun, and here end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.260
<v Speaker 0>of the noun phrase, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.780
<v Speaker 0>So this is a bit harder to read, but more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.380
<v Speaker 0>compact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.340
<v Speaker 0>And so syntactic means love this, they write.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.100
<v Speaker 0>Their structures like this here will mostly stick to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,45,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.540
<v Speaker 0>tree structure, which is easier to read.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.020
<v Speaker 0>But as I said, this is something that will be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.540
<v Speaker 0>handy for the tutorial next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's think a little bit about what we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 0>can do with those rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.620
<v Speaker 0>We've so far seen a really simple grammar right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.020
<v Speaker 0>We have seen this grammar which only has six rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.100
<v Speaker 0>But it turns out with a large enough lexicon, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.460
<v Speaker 0>can actually generate tons of sentences even with a simple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.340
<v Speaker 0>grammar like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.230
<v Speaker 0>So note that the rules are productive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 0>They're abstract.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100]}

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 0>They're defined over types of words, kinds of words rather

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.270
<v Speaker 0>than actual words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.030
<v Speaker 0>Write these rules here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.550
<v Speaker 0>The grammar rules, like s goes to noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:36.950
<v Speaker 0>Verb phrase is, uh, agnostic about what kind of noun

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.070
<v Speaker 0>or what kind of verb is in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.910
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.670
<v Speaker 0>So it abstracts away from that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.070
<v Speaker 0>So and that means if I have if I learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.110
<v Speaker 0>new words, I can stick them into the same rules

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.670
<v Speaker 0>and generate more sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:56.630
<v Speaker 0>So we combine these these symbols in an abstract way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.990
<v Speaker 0>And in fact there is a lot of combinations that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.550
<v Speaker 0>I can get, uh, just by sticking in different verbs

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 0>and nouns into the same set of rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.310
<v Speaker 0>We can calculate this fairly easily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume we have four determiners.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,88]}

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 0>Uh, obviously there's more, but it's a small set in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.160
<v Speaker 0>English, a set of determiners.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,92]}

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 0>Whereas, of course, most languages have a ton of nouns

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.760
<v Speaker 0>and a ton of verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.360
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume we have 10,000 nouns and 4000 verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 0>And then our rule of PNP goes to determine a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,36,100,100,100,98]}

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.160
<v Speaker 0>noun would allow 40,000 noun phrases right for different determiners

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,72,100,100]}

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.920
<v Speaker 0>and 10,000 nouns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.680
<v Speaker 0>So we get 40,000 NPS.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.080
<v Speaker 0>Then our verb phrase rules uh, VP goes to verb

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,55,91,100,100,100]}

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.760
<v Speaker 0>noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 0>We have our 40,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,84]}

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.440
<v Speaker 0>40,000 nouns and our 4000 verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.880
<v Speaker 0>So that's already 160 million verb phrases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.880
<v Speaker 0>And if we stick them together in a sentence, right,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100,92,100,68]}

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 0>160 million times 40,000, we get 6.4 trillion sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:05.720
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 0>And this is just by assuming those three rules and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 0>obviously lots of, uh, a large lexicon, but not too

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:15.920
<v Speaker 0>large.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.460
<v Speaker 0>Remember we said that once you're 18, you've acquired about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.540
<v Speaker 0>40,000 words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.380
<v Speaker 0>Here we've only assumed 14, 14,004.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 0>So this would just be a subset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 0>So in reality, of course, also the grammar is much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 0>more complicated and doesn't contain only three rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.060
<v Speaker 0>It will contain hundreds or maybe thousands of rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:42.380
<v Speaker 0>So we can, uh, generate a really large number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.460
<v Speaker 0>sentences, even with a simple grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.020
<v Speaker 0>So that is why this is a nice modelling tool,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:52.020
<v Speaker 0>because it accounts for the productivity, for the fact that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.900
<v Speaker 0>we have this combinatorial power.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, we can easily utter a sentence that nobody has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.780
<v Speaker 0>uttered before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, we can take an existing sentence and add an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.140
<v Speaker 0>adjective and create a new sentence that way and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 0>So language is really very, very productive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 0>There is another trick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.190
<v Speaker 0>So I've hopefully convinced you that we can generate lots

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.430
<v Speaker 0>and lots of sentences, even from a simple grammar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 0>But can we generate infinitely many sentences?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Or do people think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.030
<v Speaker 0>That would be even cooler, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,64]}

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.510
<v Speaker 0>If there wasn't an actual limit, and then we would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 0>no longer be able to enumerate all the all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.750
<v Speaker 0>possible sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Do people think that's true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.150
<v Speaker 0>Infinitely many sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.950
<v Speaker 0>It's not with those rules, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 0>We have actually calculated the 6.4 trillion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:55.430
<v Speaker 0>And so that's not that's large but not infinite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 0>However, if we add another type of rule, a so-called

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.310
<v Speaker 0>recursive rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.350
<v Speaker 0>So if you've if you if you've done Haskell last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,92,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.710
<v Speaker 0>semester, then you will have encountered recursion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 0>So the claim here is that human language also contains

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.530
<v Speaker 0>recursion and a recursive rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.730
<v Speaker 0>If we stick with this notation or context free grammar,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,83,100]}

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:27.410
<v Speaker 0>notation would be a rule that has um that allows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.770
<v Speaker 0>the same rule to reoccur when it's applied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 0>So this here would be an example of a of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.090
<v Speaker 0>a recursive rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone see why, assuming we have the same sentence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.050
<v Speaker 0>rule that we had before?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.810
<v Speaker 0>Why does it lead to recursion?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.290
<v Speaker 1>You have in the sense of a noun phrases verb

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,83,100,100,100,66,98,100,67,99]}

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 1>phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And since you define the phrase, I work closely with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,91,91,89,89,52,78]}

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 1>work and that person has to go back to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 1>verb place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And you have to not just keep going, keep up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,97,97,97,100,100,100,98,98]}

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,62]}

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 0>So you can turn the verb phrase into a sentence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 0>and the sentence into a verb phrase using this rule

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.090
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, no sentence rule here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 0>These two rules together can, uh, alternate forever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,55,100,100]}

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.580
<v Speaker 0>And so you can make a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 0>The sentence itself is not infinitely long, but you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.260
<v Speaker 0>make infinitely many sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.700
<v Speaker 0>And let's let's look at this in this example here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.540
<v Speaker 0>So we start here with the sentence rule S goes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.380
<v Speaker 0>to NP.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.820
<v Speaker 0>Then we apply this rule up here verb phrase goes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 0>to verb noun phrase and sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 0>So this will see an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100]}

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:55.500
<v Speaker 0>This would be a subordinate sentence something like I told

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 0>Peter that I hated him.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.460
<v Speaker 0>Something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 0>This would be the next sentence here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 0>And then of course this sentence, by virtue of S

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 0>goes to NP, can generate another verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.400
<v Speaker 0>And this verb phrase can then apply our rule up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 0>here again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71]}

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 0>Verb phrase goes to verb, noun phrase and sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,99]}

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.520
<v Speaker 0>And then this again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.840
<v Speaker 0>The sentence goes to noun phrase, verb phrase, and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.320
<v Speaker 0>this verb phrase again constitutes another sentence, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 0>At some point I need to stop speaking, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 0>But I can make the sentence as long as I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:32.920
<v Speaker 0>would like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.520
<v Speaker 0>And so this is called recursion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 0>We can think of cases where um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.600
<v Speaker 1>In.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 0>Simpler cases of recursion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.760
<v Speaker 0>For example, if we have a rule like this a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.320
<v Speaker 0>goes to a and b, then this would already be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.160
<v Speaker 0>recursive, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84]}

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Because A goes to itself, and I don't even need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.320
<v Speaker 0>another rule to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89]}

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh, to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100]}

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.680
<v Speaker 0>Generate an infinitely long sequence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.160
<v Speaker 0>So this case is a bit less frequent in language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 0>In language you mostly have these cases, this case where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,78,76,100,100,100]}

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:16.690
<v Speaker 0>there's two rules that alternate and, uh, form recursion that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:16.930
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.570
<v Speaker 0>And how plausible is this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.450
<v Speaker 0>So let's look at an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.050
<v Speaker 0>Does this actually occur.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.250
<v Speaker 0>And this is um, uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,99,100]}

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.530
<v Speaker 0>So it's a rule that contains an entity that contains

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 0>an example of itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.010
<v Speaker 0>This is invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.170
<v Speaker 0>If you want to verbalise this this is what's going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.370
<v Speaker 0>So this is a um, a sentence that I've taken

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.610

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.030
<v Speaker 0>to advise Lewinsky not to testify to Starr, that she

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 0>had sexual relationship with Clinton.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is exactly so this is not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 0>very elegant sentence, but it's definitely a possible sentence of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.030
<v Speaker 0>English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 0>And it has exactly the structure, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.470
<v Speaker 0>We have a sentence that consists of a noun phrase

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:37.230
<v Speaker 0>and a verb phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.550
<v Speaker 0>Then the verb phrase contains a subordinate clause.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.790
<v Speaker 0>So here, for example, I think I'll tell you that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 0>And this is our subordinate clause.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.110
<v Speaker 0>The story that this is a subordinate clause.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.510
<v Speaker 0>This is a bit more complicated because it's actually a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.270
<v Speaker 0>noun phrase, but it's the same principle reported that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 0>And then there's another sentence subordinate and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:03.590
<v Speaker 0>And if you count it there's actually 12 sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 0>And actually this is sometimes attributed to Chomsky to having

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.160
<v Speaker 0>realised that there's this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,96,96]}

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.960
<v Speaker 0>Way of generating infinitely many sentences through recursion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.560
<v Speaker 0>But the principle is actually older and has been realised

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,88]}

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.680
<v Speaker 0>by things by people like Galileo or Descartes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,86,99]}

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 0>Humboldt.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.560
<v Speaker 0>As I said, the sentences themselves are not infinitely long,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.160
<v Speaker 0>but I can generate infinitely many sentences because I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.480
<v Speaker 0>always apply the rule one more time and make a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.400
<v Speaker 0>longer sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay, and this is a very interesting fact that obviously

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.680
<v Speaker 0>is cognitively important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.960
<v Speaker 0>So it's something we'll come back to okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.760
<v Speaker 0>Another short quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:02.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.080
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.170
<v Speaker 0>Let's actually skip this because I'm a bit short.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 0>In short, on time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100,100,100]}

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:16.490
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 0>False alarm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100]}

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's think about this in terms of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.330
<v Speaker 0>it means from a cognitive point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:26.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 0>So we seem to have this unlimited expressive power where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:33.650
<v Speaker 0>we can generate an unlimited number of sentences, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 0>can express things that nobody has said before and think,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.170
<v Speaker 0>hopefully also express thoughts that nobody has thought before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.290
<v Speaker 0>And um, so it's the words, but also the combinations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.450
<v Speaker 0>and the words are in the lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 0>The combinations are in these grammar rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 0>And how does this, uh, how does this work out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.850
<v Speaker 0>in cognitive terms?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.810
<v Speaker 0>So you could argue that the words they live in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 0>memory and the rules are processes are forms of computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.650
<v Speaker 0>If you remember in the first lecture we talked about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.350
<v Speaker 0>mental representations and mental processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.670
<v Speaker 0>So in this very simple story with just two components,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.110
<v Speaker 0>you could say the words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 0>They're the representations they live in, in a memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 0>They are stored.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,75,100]}

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 0>And the rules are the processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 0>They're sort of little algorithms, little computational procedures okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.830
<v Speaker 0>And now of course we need to find out is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:29.630
<v Speaker 0>this actually true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:31.310
<v Speaker 0>Are there these two mechanisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe there's just a single mechanism that can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:34.310
<v Speaker 0>both things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.230
<v Speaker 0>And just on the surface it looks like there's there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:38.190
<v Speaker 0>words and rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 0>And this is again something that we will return back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:42.590
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:47.070
<v Speaker 0>Another interesting thing is how does this relate to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 0>to the rest of the language system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.910
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 0>So we talked about the lexicon where the words live.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 0>We talked about morphology, which is uh, we didn't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.070
<v Speaker 0>talk about morphology, but morphology is also rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 0>And we talked about syntax which are particular rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.040
<v Speaker 0>But of course these in itself are not very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 0>They need to interface with our mouths and ears, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 0>So that we understand and generate language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.840
<v Speaker 0>And they need to interface with the rest of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 0>cognitive systems system, where we understand where we have desires

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.680
<v Speaker 0>and beliefs and we express ideas and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.320
<v Speaker 0>So they need to interface with the semantics as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.920
<v Speaker 0>So at the moment we've only talked about the middle,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.240
<v Speaker 0>middle part here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.680
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come back to morphology actually in the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.760
<v Speaker 0>in the next lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.920
<v Speaker 0>Before we go here is one important distinction that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.480
<v Speaker 0>would quickly like to get across.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.760
<v Speaker 0>So um, and it's sort of implicit in, in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,99,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 0>idea here that, you know, linguists say we'll talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,67,100,100]}

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.640
<v Speaker 0>words and rules where psychologists or cognitive scientists would think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.280
<v Speaker 0>about the memory and the computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.040
<v Speaker 0>And how does this actually work, uh, when we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.440
<v Speaker 0>to generate sentences or understand sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.700
<v Speaker 0>And this corresponds to the distinction between words as morphological

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.300
<v Speaker 0>objects, so as things that are composed out of different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:18.740
<v Speaker 0>parts and words as the content of memory, a stretch

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.260
<v Speaker 0>of sounds that is memorised and would not be generated

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.060
<v Speaker 0>by a rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.460
<v Speaker 0>And Pinker, as I said, reading for next week, calls

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.860
<v Speaker 0>this a list theme, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,46,84]}

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 0>It's basically, if you think of the lexicon in very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.540
<v Speaker 0>simple terms as a list, then everything that is listed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 0>that is memorised would be a word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.580
<v Speaker 0>And sometimes the memorised chunks are smaller than words in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.620
<v Speaker 0>the linguistic sense, sometimes are larger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.740
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if we think of suffixes or prefixes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 0>like able or un or co, then these are probably

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,48,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.260
<v Speaker 0>uh, they need to be stored somewhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.780
<v Speaker 0>So there would be list items in pinker sense, even

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,58,100,100]}

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 0>though they're not words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:59.700 --> 00:50:59.860
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 0>A linguist will tell you these are morphemes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 0>They are not words, they're just parts of words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,65,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.430
<v Speaker 0>But we need to memorise them separately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise we couldn't use them in rules or things like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.070
<v Speaker 0>idioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.070
<v Speaker 0>Piece of cake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 0>Once in a blue moon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:15.550
<v Speaker 0>The last straw.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:20.550
<v Speaker 0>These are things that don't mean anything literally, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.110
<v Speaker 0>So a piece of cake means something is easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.870
<v Speaker 0>It's not literally a piece of cake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:25.790
<v Speaker 0>You can't eat it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 0>So presumably I need to store this as a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.630
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.350
<v Speaker 0>To remember the meaning of a piece of cake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:35.630
<v Speaker 0>Or last straw.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100]}

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:38.910
<v Speaker 0>And again, linguists would say, well, these are individual words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.270
<v Speaker 0>They're not they're not stored as a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.790
<v Speaker 0>But a psychologist probably would add it to the list

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.230
<v Speaker 0>team and would say, this is stored as a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 0>So important that the words that we recognise linguistically, they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,81]}

00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:01.710
<v Speaker 0>sometimes bigger or smaller than the words that we recognise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.610
<v Speaker 0>in psychology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:06.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'm out of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.290
<v Speaker 0>This is just a summary of today's lecture.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:09.210
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.
