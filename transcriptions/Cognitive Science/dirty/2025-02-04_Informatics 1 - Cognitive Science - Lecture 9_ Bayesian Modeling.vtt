WEBVTT

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to lecture nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we're going to talk about Bayesian modelling today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 0>So far in the course we've introduced a number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 0>approaches for building computational models of cognitive processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 0>Initially we saw rule based models, grammar based models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 0>For example, the, uh, the model that generates past tense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 0>forms based on a lexicon and a set of simple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 0>rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 0>Then later on, we looked at neural network models, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 0>are in some sense on the other extreme.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 0>They generate an output just by generalising from input patterns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 0>So they combine a powerful learning algorithm, very general learning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 0>algorithm with a lot of data essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 0>Then last time we briefly looked at the role of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 0>probability in learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 0>And today we're going to generalise this and look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 0>a framework that essentially combines symbolic aspects and sub symbolic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 0>aspects, combines rules and probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 0>And in particular we're going to look at a paradigm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 0>called Bayesian modelling, which been which has been popular over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 0>the last 10 or 15 years in cognitive modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,87,87,100,100,100,94]}

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 0>Today I'll introduce the foundations and I'll try to, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 0>to give you an intuition of what's going on in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 0>Bayesian modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 0>Then in the next lecture on Thursday, we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 0>look at one particular model in quite a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 0>detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 0>And then we will return to probabilistic modelling also next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 0>week when we look at other domains than language, when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100]}

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 0>we talk about decision making and biases in decision making

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100]}

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't already, please, take a moment to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 0>scan the QR code, which we'll need later on in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 0>the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.869
<v Speaker 0>So just give you a few seconds to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so don't worry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 0>The QR code will be back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 0>And all right, so we'll introduce some fundamental concepts to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 0>do with Bayesian modelling called posteriors and priors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 0>We'll introduce Bayes rule, which is sort of the main

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 0>formula that we use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 0>And you might be familiar with that from probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 0>If you've done some probability and then we'll look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 0>two examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 0>These are not cognitive models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 0>They're just conceptual examples to do with reference resolution and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 0>simple decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.280
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll introduce the concept of Bayesian update, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.640
<v Speaker 0>is what you do when your information changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 0>Just to quickly recap, um, we have seen, uh, various

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 0>ways in which during acquisition, in particular language acquisition, children

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 0>are able to infer information from their environment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 0>So here, for example, we have a speaker who says

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.440
<v Speaker 0>three koalas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 0>And maybe there's also pictures or stuffed toys of koalas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.720
<v Speaker 0>The child initially doesn't understand, but then hopefully is able

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 0>to map this onto some sort of counting routine, say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 0>when they're learning to count.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come back to that in the next lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.840
<v Speaker 0>So in general, they observe an input and infer the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.560
<v Speaker 0>underlying cognitive technology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 0>Be it language, be it counting, be it certain other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 0>visual concepts, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about concepts in general next week as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 0>So in this case, I listen to speech and infer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 0>the underlying words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 0>And more generally, you can think of this as an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 0>experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 0>You start with a set of beliefs and then you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 0>observe some evidence, some data, and use this to update

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 0>your beliefs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.780
<v Speaker 0>And this sort of constant process of updating is how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 0>we can model learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 0>Last time we've already looked at a particular type of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.739
<v Speaker 0>probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 0>Transitional probabilities, which is a transitional probability, is the probability

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,99,100]}

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 0>of a word given the previous word, or in general,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 0>is the probability of an event y conditioned on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 0>existence or occurrence of another event x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 0>And today we will generalise this and look at what's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 0>called Bayesian belief updates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we'll start with a very simple experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 0>Here's a mysterious box.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 0>And the idea is for you to guess what's in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.020
<v Speaker 0>the box.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 0>And you can do this on on wall club here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,98,100,95,100]}

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, you also given the dimensions of the box.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.110
<v Speaker 0>Uh, 15 by 22 by eight centimetres.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,90,90]}

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 0>Here's another picture if you want to see the box

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 0>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.470
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 0>So sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.370
<v Speaker 0>So Candy is now suddenly very, very plausible things like

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.010
<v Speaker 0>a scarf maybe wouldn't make that sort of noise.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.970
<v Speaker 0>A book maybe would make a slightly different noise, a

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.650

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.210
<v Speaker 0>its size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.450
<v Speaker 0>And nothing definitely can be ruled out, right, because of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.730
<v Speaker 0>the noise and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.250
<v Speaker 0>So the probability distribution, if you look at this as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 0>a probability distribution, has changed quite dramatically based on the

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 0>evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.650
<v Speaker 0>And this is this new distribution is called the posterior

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 0>distribution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 0>And we can compare.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.850
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if this actually works okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 0>Not use this feature before okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.610
<v Speaker 0>So you can see how your distribution has changed from

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 0>initially relatively evenly distributed across the different options to 68%

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 0>candy okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.570
<v Speaker 0>So let's try to formulate this slightly more mathematically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 0>So what we've seen is we now have a new

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 0>distribution called the posterior distribution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.820
<v Speaker 0>This is this is not your distribution.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.140
<v Speaker 0>And the important thing is that the prior distribution green

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 0>changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 0>Once you have the evidence and you get the posterior

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.220
<v Speaker 0>distribution in red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.100
<v Speaker 0>The the set of hypotheses that called hypothesis, so-called hypothesis

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 0>space remains the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Speaker 0>But the probability is assigned to these hypotheses, i.e. the

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 0>distribution changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 0>And mathematically we can express this in a simple formula

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.780

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, if we have the probability of a hypothesis h

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 0>given some data D and data is any kind of

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 0>So in this case, we shook the the box and

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.980
<v Speaker 0>we heard a certain noise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.460
<v Speaker 0>So that would be our data.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.680

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.680

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.000
<v Speaker 0>So this term here p of h given d is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 0>called the posterior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.880
<v Speaker 0>So what do you believe about the hypothesis once you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Speaker 0>seen the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 0>This inverse term p of d given h.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 0>So that's the probability that if your hypothesis is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 0>So there's really candy in the box.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Speaker 0>It has generated this noise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 0>In this case it's probably fairly highly highly probable that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 0>it has generated this clicking noise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.000
<v Speaker 0>If there's candy in the box but if the box

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.960

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,74,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 0>is zero, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89]}

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 0>So this is the probability of the data given the

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 0>hypothesis, also known as likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.970
<v Speaker 0>And this is the probability of the hypothesis a priori

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.610

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.570
<v Speaker 0>This is called the prior probability or prior beliefs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.970
<v Speaker 0>And this was your initial distribution, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.610
<v Speaker 0>When I didn't tell you much about, uh, about the

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:12.170
<v Speaker 0>hypothesis, then you could essentially guess that certain things are

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.570

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 0>But other than that, you didn't have enough information, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 0>then the probability of D, the probability of the data

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.210
<v Speaker 0>or the evidence, uh, this is how likely it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,47,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 0>to hear this noise independent of the hypothesis P of

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 0>D is actually not so important because it's constant, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.770
<v Speaker 0>It's not dependent on the hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 0>So the important terms here are the likelihood and the

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 0>prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 0>So this is all pretty abstract.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.490
<v Speaker 0>And what is this actually good for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.150
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a small calculation to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sorry, I forgot one other bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.270
<v Speaker 0>So the P of D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 0>If you want to compute this, you can actually break

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.390
<v Speaker 0>it down as follows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.510
<v Speaker 0>You can break it down by summing over all possible

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.350
<v Speaker 0>hypotheses and taking the likelihoods and the price of those

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 0>hypotheses, and computing the posteriors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100]}

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 0>And then if you add them up across all the

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 0>hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.950
<v Speaker 0>So in this case it would be can be a

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.110
<v Speaker 0>smaller box, nothing, and so on.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.750
<v Speaker 0>Then you get P of D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 0>However what people sometimes do is they just ignore p

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.670

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.310

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.710
<v Speaker 0>most likely hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.230
<v Speaker 0>We don't care about the probability of that hypothesis.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 0>And then of course, dividing by a constant p of

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.350
<v Speaker 0>difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 0>We'll see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 0>We'll see an example of that.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.080
<v Speaker 0>Next time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 0>So now we have everything we need.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 0>Bayes rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 0>And then this simple formula, which allows us to compute

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.600
<v Speaker 0>the probability of the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.840
<v Speaker 0>This is also called marginalisation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 0>This process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 0>And this can be a problem if the hypothesis space

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 0>is really big.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.200
<v Speaker 0>You can have an infinite hypothesis space for example.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.440
<v Speaker 0>Then we have a problem with computing p of d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 0>But in this case it's in the example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.840
<v Speaker 0>We'll see it straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,97]}

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Speaker 0>Reference resolution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.720
<v Speaker 0>Reference is when people refer to something with language right.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.920

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 0>to a dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.200
<v Speaker 0>I can refer to a particular dog or with a

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.680
<v Speaker 0>So this process is called reference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.140
<v Speaker 0>And here we have a toy example where we will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 0>see that the kind of inference that we can make

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.940

<v Speaker 0>reference resolution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's assume we have a game.

<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.220

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.340

<v Speaker 0>Unambiguously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.420

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.820
<v Speaker 0>You will have more complicated objects, you will have lots

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 0>If I refer to this telephone, it's easy, I say.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.830
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of students in the room, so I

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so and if we think about this in Bayesian

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.630

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.630
<v Speaker 0>There's no reason to assume that I'm more likely to

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.510

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:24.750
<v Speaker 0>So we have a prior that makes everything equally likely.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 0>However, once I say my word, I've provided evidence.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.190
<v Speaker 0>So we treat this word as evidence.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.150

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 0>So if you draw these bar charts again, then here

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.530
<v Speaker 0>is what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.490
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume the words that you can utter is

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.730
<v Speaker 0>So if you you start with the same prior in

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:02.050

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.930
<v Speaker 0>So a probability of a third.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.850

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.130

<v Speaker 0>This smiley doesn't have any glasses.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.010
<v Speaker 0>So the posterior probability of that is going to be

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.449

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 0>Because the likelihood that I say glasses, given that the

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.610
<v Speaker 0>And these two are equally likely because both smileys wear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.890
<v Speaker 0>So that's the probability of 0.5.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.650
<v Speaker 0>Intuitively, if I say smiling well all the smileys are

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.330
<v Speaker 0>My probability distribution remains the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 0>All three of them are equally likely.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.980
<v Speaker 0>a hat, so the left one and the centre one,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.500
<v Speaker 0>the probability becomes zero because this.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:18:00.260
<v Speaker 0>The the data hat is impossible given the hypothesis left

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 0>But the right smile is the only one with the

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.460

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.780

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.980

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.460
<v Speaker 0>We start with a probability distribution that is there in

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.820

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.780
<v Speaker 0>Then we get some data, some information, some evidence.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 0>This is just a single word you're saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.820
<v Speaker 0>And based on that, we can now figure out which

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.500

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 0>So we go from prior to posterior.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.980

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.950

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.710
<v Speaker 0>We have Bayes rule, and we can use this to

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.350
<v Speaker 0>work it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 0>And we'll do this now numerically just to to make

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.750

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:58.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at one example where the, the word that's

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.510
<v Speaker 0>So we go from this prior distribution to this posterior

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.350

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.430
<v Speaker 0>Bayes rule which I've written here just slightly differently because

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.550

<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.270

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.470
<v Speaker 0>So we start with the probability of the data given

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:43.250
<v Speaker 0>the hypothesis our likelihood Times the prior probability times the

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 0>Using this marginalisation formula that we've been given here.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 0>And now let's put in the numbers to see if

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 0>it works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.650
<v Speaker 0>So H is our hypothesis which smiley I'm choosing.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.050

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:13.090
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at the left smiley.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.130
<v Speaker 0>So hypothesis is left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.690
<v Speaker 0>So this smiley here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.290
<v Speaker 0>And now we need to look at the probability of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.730
<v Speaker 0>the data given the hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.250
<v Speaker 0>The probability that I will say glasses given this smiley

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 0>is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.170
<v Speaker 0>Because this smiley doesn't wear glasses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 0>So that probability is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 0>The prior of our hypothesis is just one over three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.490
<v Speaker 0>Because we have three hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.060
<v Speaker 0>We're assuming they're equally likely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,98,100,100]}

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.460
<v Speaker 0>So this is zero times a third.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 0>And so we don't really care about the denominator here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.820
<v Speaker 0>because it's you know, zero by a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.540
<v Speaker 0>It's still zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,100,100]}

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.780
<v Speaker 0>So that's the probability zero for the left smiley.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 0>Let's look at the centre smiley here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.100
<v Speaker 0>This one here up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.500
<v Speaker 0>So this smiley does wear glasses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.620
<v Speaker 0>So the probability that we hear the word glasses given

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.140
<v Speaker 0>the hypothesis the centre smiley is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.420
<v Speaker 0>Assuming if there's glasses then this the probability of saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.380
<v Speaker 0>glasses is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 0>And then the prior probability is still a third.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 0>And here we're summing up the other probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.980
<v Speaker 0>So zero times a third, one times a third.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 0>And also for the right smiley one times a third

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:29.580
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 0>These are these are the three hypotheses left centre and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.880
<v Speaker 0>So this is Says one third over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,91]}

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.440
<v Speaker 0>Two thirds is one half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so the probability after here in the word glass

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,50,51,100,100,92]}

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.240
<v Speaker 0>is for the centre smiley is one half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.840
<v Speaker 0>And for the right smile is exactly the same computation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 0>It's also one half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,81]}

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.760
<v Speaker 0>So this is confirming our intuition that initially before hearing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 0>any evidence, we don't know which of these smileys is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,68,100]}

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 0>more likely than any other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61]}

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 0>So they're all equally likely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.280
<v Speaker 0>Once we know that they're wearing glasses, only the centre

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.640
<v Speaker 0>and the right one are left over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.320
<v Speaker 0>And these are in turn equally likely because we don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.680
<v Speaker 0>have any more information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 0>So they're both 0.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,93]}

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.480
<v Speaker 0>The posterior probability is 0.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100,100]}

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.400
<v Speaker 0>If we then heard another utterance say hat, then we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.520
<v Speaker 0>could in turn eliminate this possibility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.400
<v Speaker 0>And the probability here on the right would go up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.920
<v Speaker 0>to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we can update our probabilities as more information

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.370
<v Speaker 0>becomes available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 0>This is called Bayesian update and we'll see that in

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:44.930
<v Speaker 0>a moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 0>But first there's another quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 0>So this is sort of very quick check that you've

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.330

<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

<v Speaker 0>Posterior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.080
<v Speaker 0>And then you have to.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.860

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.860

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.020

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.230
<v Speaker 0>This is sometimes called a uniform prior right.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.870
<v Speaker 0>Because it's a uniform probability distribution that assigns the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.310
<v Speaker 0>probability to everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.350
<v Speaker 0>If the probability was zero that would be unfortunate because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.190
<v Speaker 0>then our posterior would be zero as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.710
<v Speaker 0>Then we couldn't really do anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 0>But we've already seen a uniform prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:13.670
<v Speaker 0>So in the in the smiling example right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,98]}

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.790
<v Speaker 0>So here three outcomes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 0>Each of them is a third in terms of probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 0>So that would be a uniform prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.510
<v Speaker 0>Whereas in our in our box example the prior was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.830
<v Speaker 0>not uniform.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.370
<v Speaker 0>I mean there wasn't a lot of variation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 0>But here, for example, we have a lower prior probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.530
<v Speaker 0>So we don't have to have a uniform prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 0>And actually in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.050
<v Speaker 0>In some sense there is no point in using a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.530
<v Speaker 0>prior if it's uniform, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 0>Because it doesn't add any information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.650
<v Speaker 0>And we will look at more interesting priors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.730
<v Speaker 0>Well, actually in the next example, but also in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.210
<v Speaker 0>next lecture on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 0>So the rest of the lecture is really a complicated

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.370
<v Speaker 0>example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 0>Another example of an application of Bayes rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.090
<v Speaker 0>Before we get there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,100,100]}

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 0>Now it's a good point to ask any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:19.610
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 0>Everything clear?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.930
<v Speaker 0>Everything unclear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.050
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:24.610
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:26.890
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.450
<v Speaker 0>So this is an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:29.620
<v Speaker 0>Nothing to do with linguistics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.180
<v Speaker 0>This time is a decision making example, and we'll talk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 0>more about decision making and more formally also about biases

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 0>in decision making next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.660
<v Speaker 0>But here's a small example to start with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is a holiday kind of scenario.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 0>Peter and John are on vacation in a country where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.300
<v Speaker 0>they don't speak the local language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 0>The city that visiting has awesome hot springs with monkeys,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Speaker 0>and they want to go to the hot springs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Speaker 0>So this, I don't know, could be Japan.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately, the hot springs do not allow clothing, so they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.700
<v Speaker 0>have to bathe naked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 0>And Peter is really shy about bathing with women.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.500
<v Speaker 0>Unfortunately, no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:09.700
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 0>Fortunately, the hot springs have one day a week for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Speaker 0>men only and another one for women only.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.060
<v Speaker 0>And?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.300
<v Speaker 0>But the place is low tech.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.380
<v Speaker 0>There's no signage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100]}

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.340
<v Speaker 0>You cannot find out easily which day is for men

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 0>only.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.510
<v Speaker 0>So Peter has an idea to solve this problem Every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 0>day they'll go to the spring and see which people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.910
<v Speaker 0>are coming out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 0>And then based on that, they will try to infer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:42.390
<v Speaker 0>whether it's men only, women only, or mixed day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 0>And obviously this is an inference problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.110
<v Speaker 0>And it's a problem where you use data, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.430
<v Speaker 0>You have an observation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.350
<v Speaker 0>You can see who's coming out of the bathhouse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 0>And so Bayes rule is basically a great way of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.630
<v Speaker 0>making this inference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 0>And in order to try to apply Bayes rule, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 0>first thing you need to do is think about your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.790
<v Speaker 0>hypothesis space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.470
<v Speaker 0>Hypothesis space is the set of possible outcomes that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:13.910
<v Speaker 0>want to draw inference over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.750
<v Speaker 0>So here it's fairly straightforward right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 0>There's only three possible states.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 0>One is it's a women only day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,95]}

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.590
<v Speaker 0>The other one is no restriction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.510
<v Speaker 0>And the third one is a men only day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,76,100,100]}

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 0>And basically Based on these set of hypotheses and some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.890
<v Speaker 0>clever assumptions about the prior and some data that we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:37.490
<v Speaker 0>observing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.250
<v Speaker 0>We want to figure out which day it is with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.490
<v Speaker 0>a certain probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:41.850
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.330
<v Speaker 0>That's what Bayes rule allows us to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.770
<v Speaker 0>So let's first think about the prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.690
<v Speaker 0>How can we work out the prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.290
<v Speaker 0>Well there's one day per week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.770
<v Speaker 0>Women only one day per week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.610
<v Speaker 0>Men only seven days in the week, of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.010
<v Speaker 0>So that means our prior should be something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.250
<v Speaker 0>Women only.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.530
<v Speaker 0>It's one over seven men only the same one over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 0>seven and no restrictions five over seven the other five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.130
<v Speaker 0>days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we don't have a uniform prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 0>We have a prior that gives us some information, namely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 0>that it's a lot more likely to have an unrestricted

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.290
<v Speaker 0>day than women only or men only day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,31,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:25.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.220
<v Speaker 0>So that's already useful for drawing this inference, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:55.020

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.960

<v Speaker 0>If it's no restriction, the likelihood of each of the

<v Speaker 0>If it's women only, then likelihood of men is zero.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:15.880
<v Speaker 0>So now based on this, we can produce our, uh,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.440
<v Speaker 0>we can compute our prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 0>So just to remind you, the probability of a hypothesis

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 0>given the data, where the data is our observation, Who's

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.610
<v Speaker 0>coming out of the the spa is the probability of

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.890
<v Speaker 0>the data given the hypothesis times the probability of the

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:38.170
<v Speaker 0>So let's compute this product up here first likelihood times

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 0>prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.490
<v Speaker 0>This is sometimes called the posterior score because it's not

<v Speaker 0>a probability yet right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92]}

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 0>To make it a probability we need to divide by

<v Speaker 0>p of d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63]}

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 0>So this is simply the product of the prior and

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.610
<v Speaker 0>the likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.970
<v Speaker 0>So in the first case zero times one seventh is

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.490

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:04.170
<v Speaker 0>So there's no restriction is five over 14 and one

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.650

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.290
<v Speaker 0>If it's a man only day is one over seven

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:12.690
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.929
<v Speaker 0>Now we need to turn this into a probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.350
<v Speaker 0>And for that we need to compute the probability of

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.669
<v Speaker 0>the evidence here p of d in the denominator of

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Bayes rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.389
<v Speaker 0>So and here we take all the possible outcomes.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.270

<v Speaker 0>H1 h2 h3 times the probability of the of the

<v Speaker 0>h and then the likelihood of the h.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 0>So this would be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.070
<v Speaker 0>This here is obviously zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 0>This is five over 14.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 0>This is one over seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>This is seven over 14 equals one half.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.870
<v Speaker 0>So that's the probability of the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 0>So we can plug this in here into Bayes rule.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 0>And now we get our posterior right.

<v Speaker 0>two over seven.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.790
<v Speaker 0>Note that these are now probabilities right?

<v Speaker 0>a probability.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.400
<v Speaker 0>Should they go in?

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.600

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.880

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 0>So should they go in?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.980
<v Speaker 0>Or should they wait longer?

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.500
<v Speaker 0>Is this 90%?

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 0>Have they already achieved the 90% or not?

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 0>So the same game prior probability remains the same.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.300
<v Speaker 0>One over seven five over seven one over seven.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.220
<v Speaker 0>The likelihood of seeing five men and it's a women

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 0>only day is of course zero still.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.580

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.380

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.260
<v Speaker 0>And so now, of course, we have six pieces of

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.780

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.780
<v Speaker 0>So to get the probability, we need to now multiply

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.460

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 0>So in the case of zero that's zero to the

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.660

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.030
<v Speaker 0>But here for the no restriction it's one half to

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.830

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.630
<v Speaker 0>That's five over 484.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 0>And then for the posterior for men only day, the

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.990

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 0>So that's to the power of six is still one

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.510

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.110
<v Speaker 0>So these are the posterior scores.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.990
<v Speaker 0>These are not probabilities yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.350
<v Speaker 0>We need to normalise them by the probability of the

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 0>data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.830
<v Speaker 0>So for that we add this and this.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 0>And this is 69 over 480 448.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:05.030
<v Speaker 0>And we can now compute the posterior by taking our

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.110

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 0>And so the probability of H2 given the data is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.830
<v Speaker 0>now 0.072.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:19.000
<v Speaker 0>And the probability of h3 only given the data is

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.400

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92,92]}

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.680
<v Speaker 0>So around 90% sure that this is a man only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.560
<v Speaker 0>It could still be a fluke.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.880

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.720

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.680

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:43.240

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.240

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.120

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.200

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 0>So we started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.960
<v Speaker 0>We started with a certain posterior here based on a

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.820

<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.580
<v Speaker 0>And then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.660
<v Speaker 0>However, in a lot of situations additional data becomes available.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 0>So for example you're talking to someone and you keep

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.540

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 0>And let's assume you want to figure out whether that

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:51.860
<v Speaker 0>will be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.860
<v Speaker 0>So you start out with, let's say 50 over 50

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.620

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.940

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.140
<v Speaker 0>are.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.900
<v Speaker 0>One way or the other, right?

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 0>So you update your beliefs continuously as more information becomes

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.700
<v Speaker 0>available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 0>Or for example, you are casting a die and you

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 0>want to find out whether the die is, uh, Is

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.350

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.750
<v Speaker 0>From a single throw of the die.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.830
<v Speaker 0>You.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.070
<v Speaker 0>You cannot tell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:28.030

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.950
<v Speaker 0>So your prior would be one over six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 0>But you keep rolling the die and so you acquire

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.070
<v Speaker 0>more and more information, and ultimately you are able to

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.830
<v Speaker 0>draw the inference whether the die is fair or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.030
<v Speaker 0>So this is another example of Bayesian update.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 0>So in here what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.910
<v Speaker 0>We could in principle whenever someone comes out of this

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.550
<v Speaker 0>bar we can recompute our our posterior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,57,100,100]}

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,99]}

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.350
<v Speaker 0>So we take the previous posterior we add another bit

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 0>of information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 0>So as you can see here it's just a product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 0>that becomes longer and longer the more observations we have.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.310

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 0>It's also imaginable that the likelihood can change from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.610
<v Speaker 0>But here we're just assuming the likelihoods are all the

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:16.970

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:17.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.890
<v Speaker 0>And this process of updating your beliefs as more and

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.330
<v Speaker 0>more information becomes available is called Bayesian update.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 0>And it allows you to model this process that we

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 0>become more and more certain about a certain decision or

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.050

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.170

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.730
<v Speaker 0>So to summarise, we've seen Bayes rule as a way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.370
<v Speaker 0>of calculating the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.650
<v Speaker 0>For that we need first of all a hypothesis space,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.130
<v Speaker 0>which is the set of possible hypotheses that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.530
<v Speaker 0>consider in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.530
<v Speaker 0>In the first example, there were three different smileys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 0>In the second example, there were the the different days,

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.250
<v Speaker 0>three different days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.250
<v Speaker 0>But the hypothesis space often can be quite large, sometimes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:14.220
<v Speaker 0>can even be infinite, makes the computation more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 0>So we'll see more complicated examples like that later on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.100
<v Speaker 0>in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.860
<v Speaker 0>And then in Bayes rule you compute the posterior, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.300

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 0>on the likelihood which is the inverse, the probability of

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.900
<v Speaker 0>the data given the hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.500
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.380
<v Speaker 0>Let's assume your hypothesis is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 0>and the prior, which is the probability of the hypothesis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.740

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.340
<v Speaker 0>This computation of the priors, sometimes also called Bayesian inversion,

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 0>because, as you can see, you invert the direction of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.220
<v Speaker 0>the conditional from hypothesis, from data given hypothesis to hypothesis

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:56.980
<v Speaker 0>given data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.900
<v Speaker 0>Then you have the evidence which is here in the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 0>In the denominator and basically makes this product up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,52]}

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.180
<v Speaker 0>Probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.120
<v Speaker 0>If you don't care about this then you can, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.720
<v Speaker 0>you can get rid of the P of D, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,93,98]}

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.560
<v Speaker 0>If you just want to know what's the most likely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.280
<v Speaker 0>hypothesis, then you don't need the denominator, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 0>Because dividing by a constant will not change the order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.760
<v Speaker 0>of the hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56]}

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.760
<v Speaker 0>But here, for example, we wanted to be sure that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000
<v Speaker 0>uh, there's 90% probability, uh, offers off a given hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.360
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.120
<v Speaker 0>So there we need to divide by the p of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 0>t, otherwise we won't get a probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 0>So that's the probability of the evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 0>So in the intuition is the prior encodes the information

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 0>we have without any observations without any evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 0>The likelihood encodes the information that we get from an

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.120
<v Speaker 0>observation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 0>If we assume the hypothesis is true and then the

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.480
<v Speaker 0>posterior is is a way of combining the two okay.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 0>And that is a very powerful concept that we can

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.410
<v Speaker 0>assume that there are some knowledge that we know before

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.090
<v Speaker 0>any data could be innate, right?

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 0>Depending on what we're modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 0>And then there's a knowledge that we get from observations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.570
<v Speaker 0>You know like the the this is partially rationalist, partially

<v Speaker 0>empiricist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, in in a neural network model, you would assume

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.650
<v Speaker 0>nothing is innate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 0>You would only work with the likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 0>If you have a sort of rule based approach, then

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 0>everything would be in the priors.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 0>Everything would be given to you without evidence.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.450
<v Speaker 0>And the posterior is the result of combining the two

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 0>If we get more evidence, this is called Bayesian update

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.770
<v Speaker 0>because oftentimes in a cognitive task, the situation is dynamic

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 0>And we need to change our hypotheses and we can

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.570
<v Speaker 0>use this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.190
