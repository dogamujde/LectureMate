00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 0>Welcome back to Informatics one cognitive science.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry, where in this room has a nice organ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I can use this in a lecture on music

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 0>cognition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is obviously a church.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 0>Uh, Thomas Bayes was a reverend.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 0>We will encounter Thomas Bayes later in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, um, so today's lecture is about cognitive science generally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's it's going to provide an introduction to two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 0>important concepts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 0>And, um, the underlying readings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 0>Let me quickly explain those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, as you've probably seen, uh, there's three readings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,64,85,100,100]}

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 0>The first one is Aston Martin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 0>This is a paper arguing for the value of computational

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 0>modelling, and this will form the basis of the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 0>part of today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 0>And then Haz is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,29,99]}

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to say a blog post, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 0>a summary of one of the books and it's making

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,49,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 0>the case for cognitive gadgets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 0>And we'll come back to what that is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 0>Here the interesting point is about innate ness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,88]}

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 0>So we'll talk about innate ness a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 0>And then I'll start introducing language, which will occupy us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 0>for a few more lectures in the coming weeks, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 0>in particular from the perspective of ineptness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 0>This paper is a bit more of a long read

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 0>and more advanced read, so it's optional, but it talks

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 0>about the existence of a critical period for language, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 0>I'll touch upon that as well in this lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 0>So cognitive modelling, cognitive technology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100]}

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 0>And then about language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 0>That's sort of the game plan for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 0>Just to revise quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 0>Last time we talked about cognitive science in general and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 0>in particular, we talked about it being the signs of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 0>mental representations and processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 0>So representation representations are things that store information in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 0>certain format, typically in a structured format.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 0>And processes are algorithms that operate on those representations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 0>So these things all go on in our minds, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 0>our brains, in some form or another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 0>And that's essentially what we're trying to study here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 0>So and these processes, they they can transform sensory information,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 0>you know, raw signal that comes in from the retina

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 0>for example, into representation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 0>Or they can just transform representation into other representations, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 0>they can take representations and turn them into actions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 0>It can be very small actions, for example eye movements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 0>or bigger ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 0>Walking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 0>Talking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 0>Moving around in the world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 0>And we have seen this conundrum here about pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume you either get two 12 inch pizzas

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 0>or one 18 inch pizza for the same price.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 0>Which one do you choose?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
<v Speaker 0>And intuitively, if you ask people, a lot of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.920
<v Speaker 0>choose the two 12 inch pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 0>Pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.320
<v Speaker 0>And Aston Martin that's the the reading, one of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,43,74,88,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.840
<v Speaker 0>readings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 0>They talk about that in a lot more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 0>However, you can easily convince yourself by working out the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.920
<v Speaker 0>area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume pizza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 0>We can abstract it and treat it as a circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 0>So work out the area of the circle and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 0>two pizzas is actually a worse deal than the one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 0>large pizza, because the area is smaller.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 0>And so that is interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 0>This is obviously something that we would like to explain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 0>And Gaston Martin argued that modelling is something that helps

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,46,97,71,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 0>us explain that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Speaker 0>How so?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.740
<v Speaker 0>So we've already implicitly done a tiny little bit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 0>modelling by computing the radius.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 0>And that's what we see here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 0>This is the formula for the radius.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.420
<v Speaker 0>Call it phi I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84]}

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 0>Where for for the area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 0>Call it phi I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 0>Where n is the number of pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 0>Pi is the constant pi and r squared is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.620
<v Speaker 0>radius of the pizza squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 0>That's just the formula of the area of a circle,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 0>Times n because we have n pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.580
<v Speaker 0>And then we can assume a decision is made based

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 0>on the um based on the area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 0>So call this decision function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 0>Omega takes the areas of two pizzas, Phi I and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 0>Phi J, and returns the one with a larger area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 0>So if Phi I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,97,95]}

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 0>Is bigger than Phi J, then we return I the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,99,91]}

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.630
<v Speaker 0>the first pizza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise we return J the second pizza.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 0>So this is a very, very simple way of formalising

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 0>the intuition here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 0>And of course we can do one better by writing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of Python and actually implementing this decision

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 0>function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.550
<v Speaker 0>First of all implementing the computation here computation of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 0>area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 0>Then here we apply this to two particular pizzas, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 0>two 12 inch ones and the the 18 inch one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 0>And then this is our decision rule right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.150
<v Speaker 0>And just decides whether the amount of food, the area

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 0>of the food is bigger in the first case, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 0>the second case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 0>And so this has the advantage of making precise what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 0>our assumptions are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 0>We assume that people take the area to decide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 0>We assume that they have a way of computing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 0>area, or at least estimating the area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.010
<v Speaker 0>We also assume that that's the only thing they decide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.410
<v Speaker 0>on, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 0>This decision function doesn't have access to anything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.930
<v Speaker 0>For example, I don't know the amount of topping might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.170
<v Speaker 0>be interesting, the thickness, the weight and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 0>There might in principle, there might be lots of other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.450
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 0>But by by formalising and ultimately implementing this idea of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.330
<v Speaker 0>this way of pizza selection, we have to make our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 0>assumptions explicit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 0>So this is obviously a trivial example of very, very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 0>simple and uninteresting example, but it illustrates this general point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 0>And uh, according to Gaston Martin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,67,100,100,100,81]}

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, what is cognitive modelling?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 0>It takes a verbal description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 0>So I told you well people compare the area or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 0>people just compare the number of pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.450
<v Speaker 0>Intuitively maybe they make this mistake and that's why they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.620
<v Speaker 0>prefer the two pizzas even though the area is small.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 0>So there's a verbal description which we have formalised to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 0>an extent to make it implementable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.180
<v Speaker 0>So this is the formalisation which is just a very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 0>small bit of mass.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89]}

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 0>And then this is an implementation which we can essentially

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 0>read off of the the mathematical formulation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 0>And this process is uh is called computational modelling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,75,100,100,100]}

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.020
<v Speaker 0>And here is a typo.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 0>So this is, this is supposed to say forces us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,91,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 0>to make a theory explicit and to specify its scope,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.940
<v Speaker 0>its assumptions, and its computational repercussions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the theory here is people use the area

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 0>to decide or people use the number of pizzas to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 0>decide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 0>Those two different competing theories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and but by implementing this I need to specify

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Speaker 0>the scope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 0>So it only looks at pizzas it doesn't look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.080
<v Speaker 0>I don't know, it only looks at round pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 0>If you have square pizzas, it no longer works, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.160
<v Speaker 0>example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.360
<v Speaker 0>And also the computational repercussions in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 0>This is a very simple piece of code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 0>But more complicated models, for example, might require a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.320
<v Speaker 0>of computation, a lot of memory, a lot of auxiliary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 0>assumptions, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 0>All of these I need to make explicit if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.160
<v Speaker 0>want to implement my theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 0>And ultimately this will improve the theory by uncovering aspects

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 0>that I've not specified very well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.240
<v Speaker 0>Right in the verbal statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 0>For example, the verbal statement here doesn't necessarily say that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.640
<v Speaker 0>the pizza has to be a circle, but if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.120
<v Speaker 0>make this explicit and I write down the formula of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 0>the area of the circle, then I need to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 0>this assumption clear and explicit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 0>If anything is ambiguous, then then And formalising the theory

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,55,100,100]}

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.930
<v Speaker 0>will force me to to resolve the ambiguity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 0>It stops us from just testing hypotheses that seem intuitively

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.570
<v Speaker 0>interesting, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 0>So without having a clear theory of why this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.970
<v Speaker 0>the right hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 0>So it forces us to work in a theoretical manner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.650
<v Speaker 0>And that basically constrains the search space, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 0>Because if we just test arbitrary hypotheses, then we might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 0>end up, um, you know, going down a dead end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,38,70,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:26.210
<v Speaker 0>and we can't do all the possible experiments that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.770
<v Speaker 0>can think of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.690
<v Speaker 0>But if we have a theory, then the theory will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.810
<v Speaker 0>tell us what kind of experiments are useful in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.130
<v Speaker 0>context of that theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.330
<v Speaker 0>And ultimately, this will allow us to generate new hypotheses,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.010
<v Speaker 0>compare existing theories, generate new hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 0>So this is the high level idea.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 0>And Aston Martin they break break this down.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:54.460
<v Speaker 0>So cognitive modelling is a multi-step process in their in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,41,100]}

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.020
<v Speaker 0>their conceptualisation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.620
<v Speaker 0>You start with a framework which is sort of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.100
<v Speaker 0>meta theory, a theory of theories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 0>Then within that framework you formulate a particular theory, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.140
<v Speaker 0>example, of pizza selection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.060
<v Speaker 0>Then you specify this so you make it more explicit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 0>We did this by providing a mathematical formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.900
<v Speaker 0>You implement this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 0>We did this by providing a bit of Python code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Speaker 0>And then this will generate hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 0>So for example it will tell us that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 0>The it's the area rather than the number of pizzas

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 0>that's important or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 0>Or the weight or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.900
<v Speaker 0>And then that's a hypothesis we can test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 0>So for example what will happen if we have two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.580
<v Speaker 0>small pizzas and one big pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 0>But the area is the same, or the area of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800
<v Speaker 0>the two small pizzas is bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.560
<v Speaker 0>Would people then select the two small pizzas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:54.880
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.000
<v Speaker 0>So it generates hypotheses like this which we can test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.280
<v Speaker 0>We can run an experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 0>Ask, ask people what kind of pizzas they prefer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 0>And this will give us data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.080
<v Speaker 0>And then as you can see there's errors in both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100]}

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 0>directions right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,88]}

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 0>So we start from the framework then go down through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.360
<v Speaker 0>theory specification and so on to data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.680
<v Speaker 0>Once we have new data we climb back up and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.440
<v Speaker 0>revise our hypothesis depending on what the data says, maybe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 0>modify our implementation and our specification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.400
<v Speaker 0>Ultimately, if the data doesn't conform with our theory, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 0>need to we need to change our theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 0>So it's a circular process operating in both directions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 0>So to explain this a little bit more what the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.920
<v Speaker 0>individual components are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.840
<v Speaker 0>So starting with the framework up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.210
<v Speaker 0>So framework is basically a conceptual system and is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 0>meta theory that allows us to, to generate, uh, more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.250
<v Speaker 0>generate uh, models and theories for a range of different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 0>phenomena.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 0>And we'll see a number of frameworks in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.850
<v Speaker 0>So we'll actually start with what used to be called

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.810
<v Speaker 0>connectionism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.530
<v Speaker 0>It's now called neural networks or deep learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 0>Um and that is very, very general mechanism for modelling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 0>cognitive processes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.810
<v Speaker 0>And it has been applied all over the place from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.050
<v Speaker 0>language to vision to more to control lots of cognitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,45,45,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.650
<v Speaker 0>domains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.970
<v Speaker 0>And that is not a theory or a model.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 0>That is a framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 0>It's a system for building models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:45.450
<v Speaker 0>And the theory is a particular, uh, a particular instantiation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 0>of this framework for example, to model food selection or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.030
<v Speaker 0>to model language acquisition, or to model object recognition, whatever

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:59.990
<v Speaker 0>cognitive, uh, whatever cognitive process you're interested in, you build

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 0>a theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 0>And initially this is verbally specified, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.510
<v Speaker 0>You just talk about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe you have a diagram with boxes and arrows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 0>like we saw last time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.510
<v Speaker 0>So the theory is at that level, it is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 0>formal yet, but it's within a given framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,46,100,93,100,100]}

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 0>And then based on the theory, which can be, as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 0>I said, described in various ways, could be mathematical, natural

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 0>language diagrams and so on, and basically tries to explain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 0>the phenomena that you're trying to explain, to explain, say,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,85,72,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 0>object recognition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.350
<v Speaker 0>And the specification then is the formal description of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.910
<v Speaker 0>system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.630
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.470
<v Speaker 0>So you have your theory, you specify it formally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.040
<v Speaker 0>And that means you also delineate the scope of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 0>you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 0>And that's quite important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.040
<v Speaker 0>For example, back to our pizza example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.680
<v Speaker 0>This only works for round pizzas, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,93]}

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.120
<v Speaker 0>We said this because the formula is specified as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 0>area of a circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.760
<v Speaker 0>So it is important to also say what your theory

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 0>doesn't do right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79]}

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 0>So you have a theory of language acquisition for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't explain the acquisition of numbers or the acquisition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:17.960
<v Speaker 0>of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.200
<v Speaker 0>Colour systems or something like that, or the acquisition of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.160
<v Speaker 0>object categories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.560
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe you have a very general theory that explains

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 0>all these things, but you need to make clear what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.320
<v Speaker 0>the limits are, what the boundaries are, and what's outside

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.400
<v Speaker 0>the realm of your theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100]}

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 0>So that's part of the process of specifying it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 0>So the theory, relevant claims theory irrelevant additional assumptions, things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.780
<v Speaker 0>that is outside the realm of your theory and inside

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.380
<v Speaker 0>the realm of your theory and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,46,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 0>And this is very important because it also constrains the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.420
<v Speaker 0>space of, of possible computational models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.500
<v Speaker 0>And that's the next step, right?

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.900

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:51.690

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 0>So let.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,56]}

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.170
<v Speaker 0>And as I said this is a the process works

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.569
<v Speaker 0>So often you actually don't start with the framework or

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 0>the theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.170
<v Speaker 0>You start with the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 0>So let's start down here and let's assume we have

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.650

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.970

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.010

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.209
<v Speaker 0>Cheerios okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.850

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.410

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.170

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.180

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.420

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:22.460

<v Speaker 0>So that's the theory behind that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 0>And the general framework is one where we assume that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:41.210
<v Speaker 0>cognitive processes, they manipulate symbols things like rules and discrete

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.330
<v Speaker 0>entities like like verbs and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 0>An alternative would be, for example, the neural networks, where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.970
<v Speaker 0>we just assume it's all basically vectors of numbers and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.490
<v Speaker 0>even words and rules and so on are encoded as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.490
<v Speaker 0>vectors of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.330
<v Speaker 0>So these are two competing frameworks that we could use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.210
<v Speaker 0>to explain this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:03.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.690
<v Speaker 0>So we have our framework words and rules as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,61,54,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.010
<v Speaker 0>theory specification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.250
<v Speaker 0>And then the implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 0>And then of course we can go down the hierarchy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.090
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 0>So if we go back so we start from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,71,51,100,100]}

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.690
<v Speaker 0>data and gone all the way up to the framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.690
<v Speaker 0>And now we can use this framework theory, specification and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.410
<v Speaker 0>implementation to generate a new hypothesis that we can hopefully

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.970
<v Speaker 0>test by getting some more data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Speaker 0>As I said it's it's an iterative process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:41.300
<v Speaker 0>So hypotheses Then let's start with, uh, other irregular verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:41.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:48.420
<v Speaker 0>So C should become seed rather than saw and helped.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,97,100,100,69,100,100]}

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.420
<v Speaker 0>And help should become help.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,98,100,73]}

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 0>Help is regular right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,89,95]}

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.420
<v Speaker 0>So we have rather than helping which would be in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.940
<v Speaker 0>a in irregular form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,93,100,100]}

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 0>Like take taken.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.220
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 0>So we have made two claims here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:07.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.020
<v Speaker 0>The first one is that this is not just for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.140
<v Speaker 0>the single verb here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:11.780
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 0>Remember we've only observed a single verb here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 0>But we are saying this applies to other verbs as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.300
<v Speaker 0>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 0>And it also applies to regular verbs, which kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.260
<v Speaker 0>makes sense, but it's something we haven't tested yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 0>And now we can get data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 0>We can, I don't know, record children while they speak.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.020
<v Speaker 0>We can check different ages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 0>Children normally start to speak at the age of two,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 0>approximately so we can record two year olds, three year

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 0>olds, four year olds and see if that makes a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.240
<v Speaker 0>difference to our hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.720
<v Speaker 0>We can look at irregular verbs, irregular verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 0>We can see if they understand them versus generate them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.600
<v Speaker 0>There's quite a lot of possibilities then for getting data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I've talked for long enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 0>We'll have a quick quiz to look at some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 0>the concepts I've introduced.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.480
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't scanned this yet give you a

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.680
<v Speaker 0>few minutes to scan it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.520
<v Speaker 0>That's the same barcode.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,57]}

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.490
<v Unknown>Okay.

<v Unknown>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is just a very simple question to check

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.090
<v Speaker 0>whether you're paying attention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.970
<v Speaker 0>So, um, we have seen the pizza example, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.090
<v Speaker 0>have seen a little Python program that decides whether 1

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.130
<v Speaker 0>or 2 pizzas should be preferred.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.170
<v Speaker 0>Is this a framework, an implementation or a specification?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.330

<v Speaker 0>So please vote now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.270
<v Speaker 0>Yay!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.350
<v Speaker 0>Implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 0>Most of you got that right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.750
<v Speaker 0>Then a t test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100]}

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.710
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone know what the t test is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.030
<v Speaker 0>I can quickly explain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100]}

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 0>A few people don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 0>A t test is a statistical test that is used

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,71,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 0>in psychology to decide whether two meanings are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.470
<v Speaker 0>Let's assume I do this pizza experiment, and I count

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.550
<v Speaker 0>how often people take two pizzas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.190
<v Speaker 0>How often do they take one pizza?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.550
<v Speaker 0>Then I get two to count two averages, and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,67,47,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 0>t test will tell me whether those two averages are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 0>reliably different or whether they're the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 0>So it's a statistical test used to analyse data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 0>And now in the guessed and margin framework is the

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.870
<v Speaker 0>t test the hypothesis?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Speaker 0>Is it data or is it a specification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 0>What do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:55.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 0>Data is the correct answer, though about half of you

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.520
<v Speaker 0>are unsure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, it is interesting because it's not raw data, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.200
<v Speaker 0>It's not individual observations or individual measurements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 0>It's some statistic you've computed on the data, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.320
<v Speaker 0>still data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.040
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 0>The T test is theoretically neutral, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't impose any models or theories or hypotheses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.720

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.910

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.950
<v Speaker 0>It's not a theory.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.790
<v Speaker 0>There's increasing evidence that these abilities are actually not innate,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 0>traditionally argue against ineptness because a neural network of course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.010
<v Speaker 0>is one of these powerful general learning mechanisms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.290
<v Speaker 0>So they want to use that to explain it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.250
<v Speaker 0>But what's the what's the alternative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:11.490
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:18.530
<v Speaker 0>So how do these cognitive capabilities evolve even if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.730
<v Speaker 0>don't assume they are innate?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,69,100]}

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.730
<v Speaker 0>And how are they transmitted from one generation to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.290
<v Speaker 0>next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.140
<v Speaker 0>So the assumption there is then that they are culturally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,81,100]}

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 0>transmitted, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.940
<v Speaker 0>Language is obviously learned from one generation to the next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.180
<v Speaker 0>Parents talk with their children.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.220
<v Speaker 0>The children then talk to their children and so on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.420
<v Speaker 0>and so on and so forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 0>So cultural evolution offers an additional or alternative mechanism for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.900
<v Speaker 0>transmitting cognitive capabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.620
<v Speaker 0>And this is what Hayes calls cognitive gadgets or cognitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.460
<v Speaker 0>technologies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.740
<v Speaker 0>And these can be representations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.980
<v Speaker 0>So for example I don't know kinship system is can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 0>be represented as a tree or as a graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 0>A food chain is obviously a sequential structure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.980
<v Speaker 0>So it can be representations like this maps for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.020
<v Speaker 0>But they can also be capabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 0>Navigation language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.060
<v Speaker 0>Numeracy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 0>So the ability to count and to estimate quantities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 0>So in her world all of this is acquired through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 0>a general learning mechanism and is transmitted through cultural transmission

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 0>from one generation to the next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.080
<v Speaker 0>Rather than being hardwired in our DNA so it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.560
<v Speaker 0>innate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.640
<v Speaker 0>Of course, you have to assume some innate stuff, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.240
<v Speaker 0>For example, this general learning mechanism, whatever it is, has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.880
<v Speaker 0>to be innate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.200
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise things wouldn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 0>And so how does the cultural transmission happen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.000
<v Speaker 0>Through interaction and communication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100]}

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.520
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.080
<v Speaker 0>You interact with your peers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.360
<v Speaker 0>You interact with your parents.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 0>And so you acquire all this stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.080
<v Speaker 0>And then the question is language itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.000
<v Speaker 0>Is that a cognitive technology as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.800
<v Speaker 0>And this is something we'll discuss in more detail throughout

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 0>the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, probably it has aspects that are innate and aspects

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.320
<v Speaker 0>that are not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.760
<v Speaker 0>Language is special because it's the vehicle of a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.080
<v Speaker 0>of cultural transmission.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.680
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 0>We transmit things by speaking, by writing it up and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.680
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.010
<v Speaker 0>So this is just a diagram that illustrates that a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 0>little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 0>So cognitive technologies would be things like this is supposed

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.250
<v Speaker 0>to be a kinship hierarchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 0>This is supposed to be a representation of, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 0>solar system and motions of of of planets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.530
<v Speaker 0>This is supposed to represent navigation, which is a cognitive

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:47.970
<v Speaker 0>skill.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:53.410
<v Speaker 0>This is supposed to represent the, uh, a food chain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,95,100,100]}

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.930
<v Speaker 0>and understanding of how food chains work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Speaker 0>So the sun and then there's grass, and then there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.610
<v Speaker 0>an insect and and the toad and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then at the centre of all of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.370
<v Speaker 0>is language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:12.210
<v Speaker 0>And language, of course, allows us to express all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.649
<v Speaker 0>this, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.570
<v Speaker 0>Maps can be explained in language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:19.210
<v Speaker 0>Concepts like time can be explained in language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.570
<v Speaker 0>Numbers and reasoning with numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 0>And of course we can also write it down and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.629
<v Speaker 0>transmit it, even if it's not direct from person to

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:30.389
<v Speaker 0>person or from parent to child and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.429
<v Speaker 0>So language in some sense is at the centre of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:41.389
<v Speaker 0>And all these ideas about cultural transmission of cognitive technology

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.710
<v Speaker 0>wouldn't work without language, communication, interaction and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.149
<v Speaker 0>So this is trying to illustrate this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.149
<v Speaker 0>Here's our child.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100]}

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.510
<v Speaker 0>The child here is an utterance like three koalas.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.430
<v Speaker 0>But at the same time of course they they see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.190
<v Speaker 0>the koalas most of the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.990
<v Speaker 0>And that way they construct these representations that we talked

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.470
<v Speaker 0>about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:11.470
<v Speaker 0>And the cognitive technologies ultimately are the representations that are

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:12.230
<v Speaker 0>being built up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 0>And they construct them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.390
<v Speaker 0>And then hopefully at some point they can utilise them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.600
<v Speaker 0>And this is just a quote to to sort of

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.960
<v Speaker 0>summarise what I've said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100]}

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.680
<v Speaker 0>So humans have created technology, physical machines, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 0>We know this of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.160

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:35.840
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:51.520

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.420

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:08.620

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a quick look.

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.260

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.260

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.580
<v Speaker 0>We acquire the number system.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:48.140

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.660

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.060
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 0>You can see this, for example, by the fact that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.860
<v Speaker 0>So again, if you look at other species, some animals

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.030

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.020

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.740
<v Speaker 0>Is language also a cognitive technology which would present us

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.820

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:49.500
<v Speaker 0>And here is of course the the Orthodox claim no

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 0>language is innate, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.580
<v Speaker 0>Language has remarkable complexity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:00.180
<v Speaker 0>It is not specifically designed to accomplish a task.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 0>That is basically why animals don't have language, because they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 0>don't have the innate capability and it's Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,98]}

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.280

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 0>I mean, kids don't speak from the beginning, but they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.800

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.520

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.320
<v Speaker 0>So here it's the assumption that this is innate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.440
<v Speaker 0>That's the only way to explain it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 0>That's sort of the orthodox view.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.880
<v Speaker 0>However, this is not sort of an armchair question, but

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 0>it's an empirical question, of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.960
<v Speaker 0>So we could look at genetic and neuroscientific evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.160
<v Speaker 0>And Hayes in her in her article talks about this

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:44.760
<v Speaker 0>a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.520
<v Speaker 0>People have until recently thought they had found a language

<v Speaker 0>However, there is now evidence that this gene does other

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.280

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.080

<v Speaker 0>You can teach chimpanzees and bonobos to some extent to

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.400

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.330
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that's an argument against Chomsky's claim.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 0>Uh, of course there are some things that are universal

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.330
<v Speaker 0>All languages have verbs, for example, but other things that

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 0>are different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 0>And in general, we have 6000 languages in the world

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.770
<v Speaker 0>and they can really be quite diverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 0>So that would be an argument against innate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:38.890
<v Speaker 0>That's probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100]}

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.770
<v Speaker 0>And one argument that we will quickly look at is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.970
<v Speaker 0>critical periods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:48.850
<v Speaker 0>So for quite a lot of cognitive functions there's a

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.290
<v Speaker 0>period during which it needs to be acquired.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:52.930
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise it goes away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.970
<v Speaker 0>You're no longer able to acquire that function.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.650
<v Speaker 0>So for example, um, the visual system needs to be

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:03.290

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.770

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:08.770

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:13.110

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.350

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:28.040
<v Speaker 0>So as you can see from the age of 1215,

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.480

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.080
<v Speaker 0>the test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.080
<v Speaker 0>And only in the native speakers show that.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.000
<v Speaker 0>However, people who start learning the language at the age

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.040

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 0>native performance and then older age of onset started learning

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.000
<v Speaker 0>English at 11.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.680
<v Speaker 0>At 1417 you are less and less close.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.760
<v Speaker 0>And then if you start as an adult, 17, 23,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 0>29 and so on, then you don't reach native performance

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 0>anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.010
<v Speaker 0>So that seems to be indicating that there is a

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 0>critical period and is actually a bit longer than people

<v Speaker 0>have previously thought.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 0>It's maybe until the age of 11 or 14 or

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.970
<v Speaker 0>something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.050
<v Speaker 0>Then, as I said, there is also evidence from language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.810
<v Speaker 0>deprivation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.890
<v Speaker 0>So this is children who were deprived of language input.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 0>And it's obviously very heartbreaking, but also very interesting from

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.810
<v Speaker 0>a linguistic point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 0>So Jeannie is a is a famous example who was

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.930
<v Speaker 0>basically abused by her father and tied to a chair

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 0>until she was rescued at 13 and she knew only

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.370
<v Speaker 0>a few words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 0>And then, of course, the linguists try to see is

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.850

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.650

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.170
<v Speaker 0>She learned quite a lot of words, but she didn't

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.110

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.910

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.590
<v Speaker 0>There is other mental faculties that are affected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:21.590
<v Speaker 0>And it's hard to, uh, to generalise, but anecdotally at

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:25.190

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100]}

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:33.990
<v Speaker 0>It's interesting because it indicates that language may be innate,
