00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 0>You know, everyone is just more comfortable with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,52,99,93,97,98,58,46,44]}

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to lecture 14.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh, today is again about biases in decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,97,89,100,100]}

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You probably remember that we talked about biases yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>And in particular we looked at what's called the framing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>And we looked at one particular way of explaining it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>which was prospect theory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>So today we're not going to talk about prospect theory,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about other biases in decision

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>making and how we could possibly explain those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Um, let's get started just with a quick recap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh, so last time we saw rational rational analysis, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>is not a theory, but is a framework for cognitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>modelling, where the assumption is that you think about what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>the optimal the rational behaviour would be in a certain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>situation to solve a certain task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>What kind of data would you need?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>What kind of environment would you operate in?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>How would you test your evidence?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100,90,100]}

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>How do you make a decision, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And you try to formulate this in an optimal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And then the next step is to look at data

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>from human participants and see to what extent that deviates

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>from the optimal, the rational way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's been a successful approach in the field for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the last 20 or so years.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>We looked at one example, which was decisions under uncertainty,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>where you have a bet and you have a certain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>chance of winning or losing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And how much attention do you pay to probabilities?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you compute expected values?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that straight expected values as we know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,47,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>them from probability theory, are not able to explain the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>human behaviour in this situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen another approach called prospect theory, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>based on expected value but also makes additional assumptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Today we are going to look at other cognitive biases,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>not just the framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Um, cognitive bias, just to remind you, is a is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>a deviation from the optimal normatively correct behaviour from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>rules of logic or the rules of probability?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh, if humans behave differently, then we're talking about a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>bias, a cognitive bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>This was different from the inductive biases we saw earlier

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>in the course, for example in language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So for example, if you choose a bet, a bet

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>is preferred even though it doesn't have the optimal expected

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>gain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Then that would be an example of a cognitive bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh, we've seen the framing effects as I mentioned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So these were uh, expressed in terms of joint bets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>where you have to make two bets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>One is typically about gains, the other one is typically

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>about losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And people choose the Non-optimal option in both cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out how the bed is framed matters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's called a framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>So if I present it in terms of expected values,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>expected gains and losses, then people make the optimal decision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.960
<v Speaker 1>But if it's framed in in another way, in terms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.600
<v Speaker 1>of surer gains or surer losses, then people don't behave

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,37,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>in an optimal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And the expectation we've seen is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.640
<v Speaker 1>So people evaluate about it at a time, and they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,73,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>have a utility function which doesn't focus on the overall

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 1>wealth but on gains and losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen that gains seem to be more important

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>than losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a utility function or a value

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>function here, then first of all you can see that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Speaker 1>the gains the utility flattens out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's diminishing returns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And the curve is steeper for losses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>So losses have a more substantial effect than gains of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>the same value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And there's also here a larger period of the curve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>where this is a linear or nearly linear effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 1>The other thing we've seen is that people tend to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>overweight extreme probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So really low probabilities or really high probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>People are something people are attracted to and they overestimate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>how probable it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>For example, to die in a plane crash or to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>win the lottery.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>These are really, really low probability events.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>But people overestimate, uh, overestimate the probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about why in today's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>So, uh, more examples of cognitive biases today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Um, and then we will reflect a little bit on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>why these biases arise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So it could be that something's wrong with the experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And the experiment actually thought that there was an optimal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.190
<v Speaker 1>solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 1>But the participants actually they interpret the experiment differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a problem with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Um, and it's also important not to forget that humans

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>operate under resource limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>We have a limited amount of time, limited amount of

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>memory, computational limitations and so on.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's a resource optimal decision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Given given the constraints we're operating under rather than a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>globally optimal decision that we would be able to arrive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.550

<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the bias though.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.670

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh, here's a description of of a person.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a bunch of statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And to ask in Kahneman, they asked participants to rate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,39,40,29,95,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>how to rank, sorry, to rank the statements in order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.240
<v Speaker 1>of how likely they are to be true of of

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Bill.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>So Bill is a physician who plays poker for hobby.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Bill is an architect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Bill is an accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Bill plays jazz for hobby.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And so let's focus on these statements here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Bill is an accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Bill place jazz for a hobby.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And then the conjunction of those two claims.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Bill is an accountant and plays jazz for a hobby.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And, um, let's call the first statement A, the jazz

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>statement J and then the conjunction A and J.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And I'm using this very simple logical notation here where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>this is an and a, not an a logical implication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So most people think that, um, Bill is an accountant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>who plays jazz for a hobby is more likely than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Bill plays jazz for a hobby.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Um, and that seems to be a fallacy, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously, the set of the set of jazz playing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 1>accountants is a subset of the jazz players.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So, um, there's this is strictly more likely than this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 1>But people still think that somehow being an accountant who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>plays jazz is more likely than just being a just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49,100]}

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>playing jazz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Um, and this is, of course, because this description that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 1>we're giving up here, uh, is, You know, stereotypical description

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>of an accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so, uh, people don't seem to, uh, to deal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,77,100,100,100,100,72,100,100]}

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>with these conjunctions in the expected way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And this is sometimes called the conjunction fallacy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Um, more specifically, uh, there is a bias towards a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.670
<v Speaker 1>representative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh, answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 1>So if we come up with a description here that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.270
<v Speaker 1>is typical of an accountant, then people will pick out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>the accountant, but they will also pick out accountant and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 1>something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Which is, strictly speaking, the wrong answer, because it's less

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 1>likely that you're an accountant and something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>But compared to just an accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 1>So this is called the representative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh, bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100]}

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And, uh, the explanation is that the description is representative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 1>of being an accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Speaker 1>And what's going on under the hood is in probabilistic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.160
<v Speaker 1>terms, is that the probability of the description given the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.640
<v Speaker 1>category.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.480
<v Speaker 1>So description is the text that we've seen and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.520
<v Speaker 1>category is accountant is high.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.720
<v Speaker 1>If it's an accountant category then you're likely to describe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>But here of course we are inferring the opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.560
<v Speaker 1>We are inferring the probability of the category given the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.400
<v Speaker 1>description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.000
<v Speaker 1>So in this task participants were given the description.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And then they had to guess the category.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Speaker 1>So uh, people somehow seem to reason that this here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>which is the likelihood is the same as the posterior,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.360
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it in Bayesian terms, then, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400
<v Speaker 1>of course, the probability of x given Y is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the same as the probability of y given x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>And what's the difference between those terms?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the prior right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>If we were to compute the posterior here then we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.360
<v Speaker 1>would need to take the prior into account.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.740
<v Speaker 1>But people don't seem to be able to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 1>And this is sometimes called base rate neglect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.500
<v Speaker 1>It's something we'll come back to later in this lecture.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of things going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>First of all, the fact that the description is representative

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 1>of a certain category, but also the fact that people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.660
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to be able to distinguish between likelihoods, this

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.740
<v Speaker 1>probability and posteriors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.900
<v Speaker 1>This probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to estimate some probabilities ourselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you scan the QR code, um, you will

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.580
<v Speaker 1>get a, uh, a short probability estimation exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And here's the code again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Here is a few causes of death.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.990

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>them by probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So starting with the most likely going down to the

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.910

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.310

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.110

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>So sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Most likely at the top.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.360
<v Speaker 0>I don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,46]}

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:44.960

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.660

<v Speaker 0>You very.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 0>Much.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I seem to have managed to reset the projector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 1>42 answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look at, first of all, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you thought.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so five people say car accident, bike accident, drowning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,38,100,100]}

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.150
<v Speaker 1>accident, shark attack, car accident, bike accident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so people don't really like cars and bikes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Um, shark is always last, which is great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Cars?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Always first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.710
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually pretty good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So car accident maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Not surprising then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Poisoning seems to be really frequent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Drowning also bike accident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh, air slash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,37]}

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 1>So the statistics I have taken this from says air

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.230
<v Speaker 1>slash space accident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure what the space accident is, but,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.070
<v Speaker 1>hey, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90]}

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Train crash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Unlikely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Shark attack.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Really unlikely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay, um, so what this is supposed to demonstrate, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 1>is that people have a bias called the availability bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>So I mean, you obviously didn't fall for this, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.280
<v Speaker 0>Explain why the representation bias is about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,77]}

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.320
<v Speaker 0>Is it a policy because it sounds correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32,20,31,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.240
<v Speaker 0>You're taking information you've gathered from data and applying it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:03.880
<v Speaker 0>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,84]}

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.560
<v Speaker 1>You mean this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560
<v Speaker 1>The representativeness bias?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.560
<v Speaker 1>It is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it incorrect?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100]}

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.800
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on the situation, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.520
<v Speaker 1>So in in this situation, it leads to an incorrect

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 1>outcome because it overrides other factors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.120
<v Speaker 1>So here if I just choose accountant then that's great

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 1>because the, uh, the description is representative of being an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>accountant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 1>But then people also think that being an accountant who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>plays jazz is more likely than just playing jazz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a fallacy then, because the representativeness

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.700
<v Speaker 1>of the description overrides the logical rule that if something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 1>is a subset, then it's less likely than the superset,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:55.380
<v Speaker 1>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Because people who play jazz are a superset of people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,99,100,100]}

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.100
<v Speaker 1>who are accountants and play jazz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>So people get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh, people make that mistake, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a sort of specific fallacy, the conjunction fallacy,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 1>which is caused by the representativeness bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And in not in all cases, the representativeness bias causes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 1>problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
<v Speaker 1>But here in this particular case where they even though

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.740
<v Speaker 1>something is, you know, provably less likely, they still find

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,70,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.820
<v Speaker 1>it more likely because it's representative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, sorry, I probably didn't explain this very well.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 1>But moving on to the next bias, and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.500
<v Speaker 1>sort of based on the observation that people find things

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 1>that are, um, that are unlikely, but highly available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>They find this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.510
<v Speaker 1>They overestimate the probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>So train crashes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Plane crashes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.550
<v Speaker 1>These are heavily reported in the media when they happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Terrorist attacks, school shootings and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Even though these are all low probability events, they are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,88]}

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.870
<v Speaker 1>highly available because of media reporting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Car crashes, on the other hand, are very, very frequent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100]}

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're not reported in the media in most cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So they're less available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100]}

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And in comparison we underestimate the probability of car crashes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's the argument here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example which is maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>So the probability is generated by just trying to remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.550
<v Speaker 1>examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the claim here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>So consider the letter r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.550
<v Speaker 1>So is R more likely to appear in the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.280
<v Speaker 1>position of a word or in the third position of

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 1>a word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 1>So most participants think first position is more likely if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 1>you actually count it in a body of text.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Then the third position is more likely, but the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 1>position is just much more available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 1>If I asked you name ten words that start with

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 1>R, you can probably easily do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.880
<v Speaker 1>If I ask you name ten words where the third

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880
<v Speaker 1>letters are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That is actually really hard, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So it is something with being available in memory being

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 1>easy to recall.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And we're biased towards events or in this case lexical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.720

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And this is called availability bias.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Um, and again just like with the representativeness bias, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.080
<v Speaker 1>is a useful heuristic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And it works in a lot of cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Something is highly available because it's very frequent most of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 1>the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:48.100
<v Speaker 1>You're maybe find it easier to, uh, to categorise dogs

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,96,100]}

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.620
<v Speaker 1>compared to, I don't know, marsupials, uh, because you've seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,99,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.700

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>in the zoo or something like that, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's an availability bias, which influences how good you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.540
<v Speaker 1>are at making a certain judgement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And there is actually a research area which is called

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,92,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>inference by sampling, where you estimate probabilities by sampling and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.020

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And so it's probably true that we are using that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Speaker 1>to some extent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And if something is available, like the dog example, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>have lots of examples of dogs to draw upon.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Then probably that means it is actually more likely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a new animal is more likely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>to be a dog than, uh, a marsupial, And also

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.510
<v Speaker 1>extreme events are often, uh, important ones.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So in in a plane crash, this is a very

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.550
<v Speaker 1>important event.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So, um, you the utility, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,99]}

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.630
<v Speaker 1>The losses or the gains are often very large for

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 1>these low frequency events.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Just like a lottery win, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,98]}

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>The probability is really low, but it is a and

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.950
<v Speaker 1>a very important event okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91]}

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that has to do with this idea that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>we overestimate highly probable or highly improbable uh, events.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So that probably also plays into this availability bias.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:36.390

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And this goes back to Bayesian reasoning.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.320
<v Speaker 1>If you remember Bayes rule where we compute a posterior

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.080

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 1>It turns out people also struggle with that.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And there's a well-known example here.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.760

<v Speaker 1>And then the police does some tests and they find

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.340
<v Speaker 1>out that the witness is correct 80% of the time

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.940
<v Speaker 1>when they're given, let's say a picture of a cop

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's in the lighting is the way it was

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 1>at the time of the accident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's at night.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.500
<v Speaker 1>So you're not 100% sure when you're recognising the colour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 1>So and then from this you're supposed to infer was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.180
<v Speaker 1>the cab involved in the hit and run, was it

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.380
<v Speaker 1>green or blue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So most people say green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the typical judgement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>But of course we have learned how to compute this

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.420
<v Speaker 1>using Bayes rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Because we're given a few numbers here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.180
<v Speaker 1>This here is basically our prior probability, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Overall, without any witness, any more information, what's the probability

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 1>that the cab is green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's 15%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.060
<v Speaker 1>What's the probability that it's blue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's 85%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.500
<v Speaker 1>That's our prior probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And this here the witness is correct 80% of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.100
<v Speaker 1>time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.540
<v Speaker 1>That is our likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So given that the cab is really green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.190
<v Speaker 1>How likely is it that the witness says it's green

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and this number is 80%?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>How likely is it that they're mistaken and they identify

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:45.870
<v Speaker 1>it as blue?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>It's 20%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So this is our likelihood here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And so we can plug this into Bayes rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 1>So we're computing the probability of green given that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.670
<v Speaker 1>witness says green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So the witness is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the prior probability that the car

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.710
<v Speaker 1>is green times the probability that the witness says green

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 1>given that it is green right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the posterior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Note the inversion of the conditional here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're trying to achieve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And then we're dividing by the probability of the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the probability of green given the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 1>witness says it's green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And the probability of blue given that the witness says

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.990
<v Speaker 1>it's blue, that it's witnesses green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,85,100]}

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.470
<v Speaker 1>But the cab is really blue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And then we work this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>This is 15% times 80% up here and then down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>here 15 times 80 plus 85 times 20.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 1>The complement the complement of the probabilities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And that works out as 0.41.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,48]}

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually less likely than 50% that the car

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.610
<v Speaker 1>is the cab is green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 1>So the correct answer would actually be blue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And but people say green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And the question is why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 1>So the traditional explanation for this is something called base

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 1>rate neglect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's a cognitive bias where people don't take the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 1>base rate into account.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Base rate is just a fancy name for prior right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,88]}

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't take the prior into account here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.730
<v Speaker 1>then of course the posterior is the same as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.570
<v Speaker 1>likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's 80%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.810
<v Speaker 1>So of course you're going to say green.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So that is the what is claimed to be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,88,100,100,100]}

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>fallacy here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And um yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So participants ignore the prior.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Ignore the base rate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And what's the explanation for this now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Well, in the literature.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.620
<v Speaker 1>So Barrell says we have a heuristic that determines the

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 1>relevance of the information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Kahneman would say the green cup is more representative of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the witnesses report, so they don't really have a very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.860
<v Speaker 1>good explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Um, the phenomenon is important because you see it in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.380
<v Speaker 1>other cases, too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So most concerningly, perhaps, is that doctors make the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.540
<v Speaker 1>mistake, and there's a bunch of experiments showing this where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.500
<v Speaker 1>the base rate would be the prevalence of a disease,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.460
<v Speaker 1>uh, let's say prevalence of a certain form of skin

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.740
<v Speaker 1>cancer, uh, is 1 in 1000, say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,85,85,85,87]}

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's a base rate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a prior probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a diagnostic test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.390
<v Speaker 1>But of course a the diagnostic test is one that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.710
<v Speaker 1>is not 100% accurate typically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 1>So you assume the test is accurate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know 90% of the time when there is

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.310
<v Speaker 1>a cancer, it gives a positive result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.790
<v Speaker 1>That would be your likelihood.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And so based on that you can use Bayes rule

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.630
<v Speaker 1>in the same way right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.190

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.030

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean, this is really a legal case that we

<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.870

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.310

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, that's correct, because obviously it's more likely that someone

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,90]}

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.850
<v Speaker 1>But maybe our description is such that somehow it's very

<v Speaker 1>a biologist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.850

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:52.060

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very accessible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And uh, if you look in particular on at the

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.750
<v Speaker 1>has many more biases than we have seen in the

<v Speaker 1>lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 1>So if that's something you find fascinating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.870
<v Speaker 1>So for example, there's the halo effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:21.030
<v Speaker 1>The halo effect is when you see that someone is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:28.610

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Well, then you think they are also good at their

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>job.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>So the someone who's just, you know, a nice person

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and well-spoken and maybe well-dressed as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Then they built up this halo, and people infer that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:43.330
<v Speaker 1>they're competent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,94]}

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So you overestimate someone's competence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is called the halo effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one of the biases that people have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:50.850
<v Speaker 1>studied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 1>We've only seen 4 or 5 in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to find out a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:02.890
<v Speaker 1>more, Kahneman also has a whole theoretical framework where there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 1>two cognitive systems called system one and system two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 1>System one is fast and making heuristic judgements, which are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes wrong, where systems two is slow, deliberative thinking less

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 1>likely to biases, and less likely to make mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So he has this whole framework anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to go beyond a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.020
<v Speaker 1>of what the course is, uh, what I'm covering here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.340
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.940
<v Speaker 1>But let's look at a particular puzzle, which is called

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the Watson card selection task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,21,98,100,100]}

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Um, and it goes like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So you have a bunch of cards, they have numbers,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Speaker 1>uh, or letters on them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So here we have E27.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78]}

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.900
<v Speaker 1>And you're given a rule as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.020
<v Speaker 1>The rule is if there's a vowel on one side

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.940
<v Speaker 1>of the card, then there's an even number on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.740
<v Speaker 1>other side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.340
<v Speaker 1>So we have two types of uh letters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100]}

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Speaker 1>We have vowels and consonants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And we have two types of numbers even in odd

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.379
<v Speaker 1>numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And you're supposed to turn over the cards that allow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.659
<v Speaker 1>you to test if this rule is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:20.659
<v Speaker 1>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 1>So logic dictates that what you're supposed to do is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 1>uh, turn over E and seven E is pretty clear,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:33.879
<v Speaker 1>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It has a vowel on one side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.679
<v Speaker 1>So I can I can test whether it's an even

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.879
<v Speaker 1>number on the other side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Seven I need to turn over because of the inverse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.760
<v Speaker 1>of this, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.159
<v Speaker 1>It has an odd number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.399
<v Speaker 1>So the other if I find, uh, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.840
<v Speaker 1>If I find a vowel on the other side, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the rule is incorrect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So both allow you to, uh, disprove the rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.480
<v Speaker 1>What people do is, though, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.720
<v Speaker 1>So this explains what I've just said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So we will write this as, uh, p and not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Q, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87]}

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.560
<v Speaker 1>E and seven seven is not an even number, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an odd number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So that would be P and this would be not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh, and uh, rather than, for example, turning over x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.730
<v Speaker 1>or two, which would be not P and Q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 1>So um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90]}

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 1>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100]}

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So it would be this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98]}

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is that p I have a vowel

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.810
<v Speaker 1>on one side implies q, and I have an even

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.090
<v Speaker 1>number on the other side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So if we flip over the e and we see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.850
<v Speaker 1>an odd number, then we have falsified the rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.130
<v Speaker 1>If we flip over the seven and we see a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.730
<v Speaker 1>vowel, then we have also falsified the rule, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way of actually confirming the rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:07.130
<v Speaker 1>But by turning over these two cards, we can falsify

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 1>the rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>People, however, they, uh, they tend to pick, uh, some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.420
<v Speaker 1>of the other cards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you, for example, take the X, then it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter if the number is even odd, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.980
<v Speaker 1>It cannot falsify the rule because x is a consonant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And if we flip over the two, then again it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.060
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter if there's a vowel or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.340
<v Speaker 1>On the other side, it doesn't falsify the rule because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's an even number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And this is when you actually run an experiment and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you ask participants which rules they take, which cards they

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 1>take, then p and Q is the most common.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.580
<v Speaker 1>So q here is two, so e and two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And then a certain number also just turn over e.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 1>But the correct answer here p and not q is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.540
<v Speaker 1>very small one out of 34 £0.34 and not P

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 1>obviously doesn't doesn't make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 1>But one person did it anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you had four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Who did?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.160
<v Speaker 1>P and Q and not Q, which again is a

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.120
<v Speaker 1>contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So that shouldn't happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And p and not p.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And q is one out of 34.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one two that turned over everything.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is that people either only turn over

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.720

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Q, and that is the correct the incorrect answer, because

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.680
<v Speaker 1>the Q doesn't really tell you anything, right?

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 1>P fair enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.560
<v Speaker 1>But Q doesn't tell you anything.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.560
<v Speaker 1>So, uh, what is going on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 1>How could we explain this behaviour?

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 1>So way back in the day and this is an

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.400

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.160

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.280
<v Speaker 1>You need to reason in terms of logical rules.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.530

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:23.330

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>That was his explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And that is obviously a statement of, you know, this

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.530

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very good way of, uh, of dealing

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.210

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 1>So people have been trying to understand what's going on

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.330
<v Speaker 1>ever since.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.490

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.450
<v Speaker 1>And let's maybe try quickly whether we can use our

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:58.010
<v Speaker 1>biases that we've seen to explain this.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 1>So we go back here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the biases we've seen in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you think one of these biases could explain the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.490
<v Speaker 1>fact that people are not really able to reason logically

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.420

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Could it be the framing effect, availability bias, representative bias,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:22.980
<v Speaker 1>and so on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.320
<v Speaker 1>So 20% thought framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,98]}

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone want to explain framing effect?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:06.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, actually, this information is flexible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,83,89,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.040
<v Speaker 0>So that you think that if you apply the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,84,100,100,95,99,78,70,100]}

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.520
<v Speaker 0>set of about 20s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,96,68,71]}

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.130
<v Speaker 0>Maybe next week or two more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,98,41,39,88]}

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.890
<v Speaker 1>So the explanation, let me just repeat it, is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it's something about information gain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So turning over the first card gives a certain amount

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.290
<v Speaker 1>of information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you don't need the second card anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's really about maximising some form of informativeness out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 1>of the data rather than following logical rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually this is an explanation that has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.730
<v Speaker 1>been advanced in the literature.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'll talk about this briefly at the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:54.090
<v Speaker 1>So um, in general, it turns out that how the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 1>problem is formulated is important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 1>So if I give you an abstract rule, like there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.210
<v Speaker 1>a vowel on one side and an even number on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>the other side, then this is really hard for people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:10.210
<v Speaker 1>If I give you a familiar rule, like if you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:14.260
<v Speaker 1>over 16, you're allowed to drink alcohol, Then people are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>actually quite good at reasoning with examples like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.180
<v Speaker 1>So that is also an aspect of the framing, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.500
<v Speaker 1>How familiar is the situation and how is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Can you relate it to an everyday situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.460
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a type of framing effect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's availability right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,60,100,66]}

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.780
<v Speaker 1>If you've encountered rules like this before and you think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.100
<v Speaker 1>about implications like a if A then B all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.940
<v Speaker 1>time, then maybe you find this easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,68,100]}

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So it could be availability as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Representativeness I'm not sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Base rate neglect I'm also not sure because there's no

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.820
<v Speaker 1>probabilities given a priori.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.300
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if we know that vowels and consonants are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.700
<v Speaker 1>not the same probability, then something like base rate could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 1>come in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Conjunction fallacy could be because people don't seem to be

<v Speaker 1>P and not P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Um, so things maybe that is one aspect of logical

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And as I said, there's a long sort of tradition

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one particular, um, alternative explanation.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh, so there's basically two competing hypotheses, right?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 1>If you write this the rule down as an implication.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 1>If P, then q can either be true or can

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:16.450

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we're actually interested in finding out the most

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.130

<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.730

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.770

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.410
<v Speaker 1>this is evidence against the rule, we also want evidence

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.140

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.340
<v Speaker 1>P and Q which would be Alice's.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.940

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Ask the tripe eaters how they feel.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.420

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And then secondly, ask sick people if maybe recently they've

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.100

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 1>sick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Bob has a strict logical approach here of P

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.260

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Ask eaters how they feel and ask well people if

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:04.860

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.820
<v Speaker 1>So which policy seems more reasonable here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.640

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,60,100,100]}

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Because talking to the sick people is bound to be

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.280
<v Speaker 1>more informative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot fewer of them probably, than, well,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 1>people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.400
<v Speaker 1>So just randomly asking people that are not feeling sick

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.800
<v Speaker 1>whether they've eaten tripe, that's not going to be very

<v Speaker 1>informative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.880

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.760

<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 1>We're taking into account the fact that being sick is

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 1>more informative for our for the rule we're trying to

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.320

<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Remember we didn't have an abstract rule.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.040

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.720

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.760

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100]}

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.880

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.600

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.570

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the wasting card selection task, is that people always have

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.690

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:19.450
<v Speaker 1>They're making assumptions about probabilities because in everyday life there's

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And you can actually formalise this, and you can make

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:40.650
<v Speaker 1>the assumption that people choose the options P and Q

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.770
<v Speaker 1>in this case that are most informative for testing this

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 1>rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:50.090
<v Speaker 1>So the probability of p and q should then affect

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.050

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm no longer assuming this is purely a logical

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.650
<v Speaker 1>So if I manipulate the probability of p and q

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 1>then people's behaviour should change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100]}

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.330

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So in this plot you have the probability of q

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.780
<v Speaker 1>here on the y axis, the probability of p on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 1>the x axis, and here the black region where the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.220
<v Speaker 1>probability of p is between zero and point two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:25.380
<v Speaker 1>sorry of q and the probability of p, um, roughly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.460
<v Speaker 1>matches the probability of q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh, is the region where, uh, turning over p and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.620
<v Speaker 1>q would be optimal, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91]}

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So the answer is basically p.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And q is a good strategy sometimes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the probability of p and q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.380
<v Speaker 1>If the probability of q, for example, becomes too low,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 1>then it's a good idea to look at not q

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 1>rather than q okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Because the probability of not q obviously is one minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the probability of q and Oxford.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And later they have a fairly complicated story to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 1>with the expected information gain and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can make this mathematically precise, but the intuition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.320
<v Speaker 1>is that the logical story is not the whole story.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.760
<v Speaker 1>You need to take into account the probability of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 1>different forms of evidence as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.480
<v Speaker 1>So today we've seen a number of classic experiments to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>do with decision making.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at framing effects as you see them in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.320
<v Speaker 1>paired lotteries.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.840
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at the representative bias where if the description

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.920
<v Speaker 1>of of an event or a person is very representative,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.600
<v Speaker 1>then this overrides other evidence, the availability bias, where we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 1>go for things that are easily accessible, they are present

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 1>in memory or in the environment or in the news.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We've seen base rate neglect where people don't take the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.080
<v Speaker 1>prior probability into account and when they reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen the waste and card selection task, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.320
<v Speaker 1>is about how logical reasoning and probabilistic reasoning interact in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 1>complicated Ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And overall, the enterprise is to try to understand the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 1>limits of of rational behaviour, of optimal behaviour and try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.650
<v Speaker 1>to explain why in some situations we behave in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:19.650
<v Speaker 1>rational, optimal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.890
<v Speaker 1>When we make decisions, in other situations we don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's it for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's also my part of the course.
