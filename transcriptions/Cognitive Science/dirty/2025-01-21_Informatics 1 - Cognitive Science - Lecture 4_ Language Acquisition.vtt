00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't already, please scan the QR code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 0>We'll again have some interactive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 0>Exercises on Wall Club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,31,34]}

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 0>So today we're going to talk about language again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 0>So building on the the Friday where we talked about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 0>rules and words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 0>Now we're going to talk about what this means in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 0>cognitive terms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 0>And in particular I'd like to talk about language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 0>So language acquisition is the process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 0>Maybe this isn't loud enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 0>Language acquisition is the process of acquiring a language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 0>Learning a language in particular in children.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 0>So cognitive scientists, when they talk about language acquisition, they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 0>mostly interested in child language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 0>I mean, a few people also study language acquisition in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,100,100,58,100,100,98]}

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 0>adults, but it's generally thought to be quite a different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 0>process from first language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 0>So here we'll only talk about first language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 0>This is really interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100]}

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 0>So this is the game plan.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 0>We're going to talk about the past tense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 0>Because the past tense has been used as a as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 0>a case study, as sort of a and an exemplar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 0>that people have used to study language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 0>And we'll see why in a moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll look at what kind of evidence we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 0>normally rely on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll try to sort of zoom out a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 0>little bit and talk about knowledge acquisition more generally, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.610
<v Speaker 0>different views of how that happens in cognitive science in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 0>particular will come back to a neatness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,78,88]}

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 0>If you remember, lecture two where we talk about talked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,70,100,95,100,100]}

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 0>about cultural evolution and innate knowledge versus learned knowledge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 0>So this sort of debate also looms large in terms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 0>of language acquisition or knowledge acquisition more generally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 0>Then there's a preview, just two slides talking about neural

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 0>networks, which will start in earnest on Wednesday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 0>On Thursday and on Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 0>Just to recap basically what we said on Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we have argued that human language involves two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 0>types of mental tissue, two types of mechanisms and two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 0>types of knowledge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there's a lexicon of words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 0>These are stored.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 0>They're retrieved from memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's a finite list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 0>Uh, precomputed, readily available, presumably also very fast to access.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 0>And if you've attended the tutorials, uh, will we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,47,47,100,100]}

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 0>seen quite a lot of examples there of stuff that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 0>is precomputed in other languages as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 0>Not just in English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 0>If not, well, go to one of the tutorials this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 0>week to find out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.360
<v Speaker 0>And in addition to that, there's a set of rules

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 0>of computational procedures that act upon those stored lexical items,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 0>for example, to to construct sentences, but also to construct

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.520
<v Speaker 0>words and more complicated words from simpler words, for example,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.280
<v Speaker 0>by affectation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60]}

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 0>So you like, like it would be a fixation process,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,56,63,97,45,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 0>or the compounding train and conductor becomes train conductor and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280
<v Speaker 0>So the rules can act upon words as well as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 0>on phrases and sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.760
<v Speaker 0>We've talked about this notation here, which is called context

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.880
<v Speaker 0>for grammar notation, where the words are written as lexical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 0>items like this determiner goes to the where there is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,60,96]}

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.060
<v Speaker 0>is an article or a determiner, and n goes to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 0>dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is the part of speech for dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 0>And then we can have rules that construct phrases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 0>So a noun phrase is made up of a determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 0>a noun a verb phrase is made up of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 0>verb and a noun phrase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.660
<v Speaker 0>And then if we have a sufficiently large quantity of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 0>of words and rules, then we can use that to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.340
<v Speaker 0>parse sentences, to turn them into syntax trees, to turn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 0>them into structures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 0>These structures are useful a for computing whether a sentence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 0>is part of the language is grammatical or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 0>And b they can also be used in deriving the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 0>meaning for the sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 0>And again the tutorial talks about that a bit more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.780
<v Speaker 0>So at this point this is just a hypothesis, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 0>This is something that linguists have dreamed up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 0>And how do we know whether speakers actually do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 0>They actually store lexical items in the in their brains,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,82,100]}

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 0>and they actually apply rules On those lexical items to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 0>compute sentences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.150
<v Speaker 0>How would we even test this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 0>There's various ways of getting evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 0>People have looked at large amounts of speech or text,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 0>so-called corpora of data, and try to find patterns, patterns

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.030
<v Speaker 0>that repeat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 0>you can try to test whether there's rules, whether there's,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.650
<v Speaker 0>And they don't use any rules, right?

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 0>They don't even have lexical items in the same way

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 0>So that's already a little bit of evidence that maybe

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.370
<v Speaker 0>It just means it's possible for a sufficiently large model

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.170
<v Speaker 0>Another thing people have done, they've studied human language processing

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.970

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.810
<v Speaker 0>It would, for example, entail that things that are stored

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 0>You just have to retrieve them then then they're ready.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if you apply those rules, then maybe this takes

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.780

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.500
<v Speaker 0>Write rules that have low frequency items that have a

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 0>Maybe these take longer if you apply a lot of

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.900

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 0>So a phrase that is made up of lots of

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.740

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is something you can you can test.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 0>You can, for example, do brain imaging.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Speaker 0>You can do reaction time studies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.420

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 0>These are all, uh, ways of getting evidence for the

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.940
<v Speaker 0>real time process that happens while we are listening or

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 0>reading or while we're speaking or writing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Speaker 0>And another way of looking at this is to look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.740
<v Speaker 0>at the sort of errors that people make.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.580
<v Speaker 0>And these are often systematic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Certain errors occur frequently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.600
<v Speaker 0>Others occur not at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 0>And then looking at the patterns of errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 0>Maybe also for corpora, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,78]}

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 0>Text often doesn't contain a lot of errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.760
<v Speaker 0>But speech, you know, as I speak now, I make

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.160
<v Speaker 0>errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 0>I use the wrong word, I don't finish my sentences

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 0>Maybe this is also interesting in terms of evidence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 0>And then a fourth type of evidence is from language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 0>acquisition to see what happens during language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 0>People obviously don't start speaking from the day they're born.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.520
<v Speaker 0>They start speaking sort of between 12 and 15 months.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 0>And they don't they're not fluent speakers of the language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 0>from from the start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.919
<v Speaker 0>It actually takes quite a lot of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 0>And so it's interesting to look at this process again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 0>Look at the errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 0>Look at what kind of utterances they are able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,82,100,100]}

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.720
<v Speaker 0>produce, how they become more complicated, how they mirror the

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.330
<v Speaker 0>language that they hear from adults and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 0>So the acquisition hopefully also tells us about how language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 0>is actually used in cognitive terms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.690
<v Speaker 0>And here we'll look at in particular past tense because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.130
<v Speaker 0>that is an interesting example where some things are memorised

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 0>and some things are rule based.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.290
<v Speaker 0>And it's a bit like a fruit fly, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.050
<v Speaker 0>If you're a geneticist and you always study fruit flies

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.250
<v Speaker 0>as a model organism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 0>So we look at the past tense as a type

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.490
<v Speaker 0>of model organism.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.490
<v Speaker 0>So some quick facts about the past tense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 0>So well there's a very simple rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,89,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 0>Just add ed to the present tense or to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.690
<v Speaker 0>to the base form of a verb.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 0>And then you get the past tense like liked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 0>And at least for regular verbs, there isn't really a

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 0>finite set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 0>You can always make new verbs in English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.850
<v Speaker 0>It's very easy to turn a noun into a verb

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so new concepts arise all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,97,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 0>So new words are coined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 0>And these can be verbs as well as nouns.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.020

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 0>Jog becomes jog to walk becomes walked.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.180
<v Speaker 0>Play becomes played.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 0>Kids becomes kissed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88]}

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 0>But also these relatively new verbs like spam, mosh, which

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 0>You can say this planet was Pluto, which means it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.900

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.660

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.180
<v Speaker 0>Pluto.

<v Speaker 0>For me, this is a Gen Z word of, and

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 0>it means understanding something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, and of course, the same rule applies even though

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.460
<v Speaker 0>these are new words spammed, mosh, Pluto dropped, and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,43,100,75,100,100]}

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.660

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so far, so good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.660
<v Speaker 0>However, the story is slightly more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 0>If we look at verbs like this buy, hold still,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 0>go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.720
<v Speaker 0>So buy it, hold it still, and so on are

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 0>not grammatical in English.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.880
<v Speaker 0>So this asterisk means it's not grammatical.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.800
<v Speaker 0>And instead we have these forms here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.280

<v Speaker 0>Stole.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.320
<v Speaker 0>Went.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 0>Uh, these are so familiar and frequent that we don't

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.560
<v Speaker 0>even notice, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,64]}

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.120
<v Speaker 0>Irregular verbs like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.240
<v Speaker 0>If you learn the language, you somehow need to pick

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.440
<v Speaker 0>up these irregular verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 0>And you need to somehow learn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.280
<v Speaker 0>And you don't say buy it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,46,62]}

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 0>You need to say bought instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100]}

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 0>And then, of course, there is sort of islands of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 0>regularity, even in the irregular verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 0>So it's sing sang ring rang.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,83,100,100]}

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 0>So these obviously are similar in even though they're both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.560
<v Speaker 0>irregular, but it's not clean clang or think tank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,67]}

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.640
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 0>So there's, uh, irregular verbs and some of them have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.930
<v Speaker 0>a common pattern.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 0>But then there's exceptions to those common patterns as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 0>So it's reasonably interesting what's going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.410
<v Speaker 0>And how could the child possibly master that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,98]}

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:02.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.290
<v Speaker 0>But just to summarise what I've said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.570
<v Speaker 0>So some past tense forms are not just Ed, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.170
<v Speaker 0>they are still somewhat regular, like singsong ring rung.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,85,43]}

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, historically, actually this was a different type of, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.090
<v Speaker 0>past tense, which no longer exists except in these irregular

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.570
<v Speaker 0>verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it is a bit chaotic and idiosyncratic and,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.980
<v Speaker 0>but it's a small number of irregular verbs, 150 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,76]}

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.370
<v Speaker 0>180 and, uh, hasn't been really augmented recently, so sneak

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,96,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Speaker 0>snuck seems to be the latest addition in the 19th

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 0>century.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:46.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's actually have a short quiz so that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.550
<v Speaker 0>you can try this out yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.670

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.590
<v Speaker 0>give you 30s to do it now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Unknown>Can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,64]}

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.550
<v Speaker 1>That.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.830
<v Unknown>We're going to do that.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.630
<v Speaker 0>Let's maybe move on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.830
<v Speaker 0>So if you could please guess the past tense forms

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.630

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 0>And of course, I've, I've taken some verbs that are

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Speaker 0>a bit more complicated and new or infrequent and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,36,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 0>So just, uh, try to type the past tense forms

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.630

<v Unknown>Of support.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,60]}

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.080
<v Speaker 0>So as you can see, they come in two categories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 0>The first.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 0>The first part are weird.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 0>Irregular verbs in the second part are low, frequent low

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.080

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.840
<v Speaker 0>They all occur in the dictionary.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 0>So I did check that I didn't just make them

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.080

<v Speaker 1>Some.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.260
<v Speaker 0>So we can see the most frequent answers here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.100

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.700
<v Speaker 0>So bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.260
<v Speaker 0>Most people think bid is, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,79]}

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 0>Is the past tense like in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.620
<v Speaker 0>And that's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.820
<v Speaker 0>But, um.

<v Speaker 0>Bid bid it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100]}

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.780

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.540
<v Speaker 0>It's slightly archaic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 0>So that already makes it more tricky if you have

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.190

<v Speaker 0>have guessed this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 0>So typically sort of in fixed expressions like ironclad, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.230
<v Speaker 0>it's an old past tense form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 0>And then for sake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,77]}

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:09.070
<v Speaker 0>So forsaken would actually be the past participle, not the

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.750
<v Speaker 0>past tense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.590
<v Speaker 0>So for succ is the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,21,100,100]}

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.150
<v Speaker 0>Is the correct the correct past tense form?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.630
<v Speaker 0>Forsaken in I have forsaken him, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.870
<v Speaker 0>So that's the past participle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.790
<v Speaker 0>It's not the past tense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.750
<v Speaker 0>And here, apparently slunk is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 0>I actually need to check myself.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.550
<v Speaker 0>Slang is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100]}

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.310
<v Speaker 0>And the other ones are just regular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.590
<v Speaker 0>Simp is apparently giving someone unwanted attention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.530
<v Speaker 0>So, like, he's juiced up his wardrobe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,39,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.410
<v Speaker 0>Something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.050
<v Speaker 0>And there you have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100]}

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not seen this before, but you can tell they're

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.770
<v Speaker 0>probably regular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.650
<v Speaker 0>Whereas for slunk, something tells you that this is a

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 0>bit like sink sunk, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,95]}

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.689
<v Speaker 0>Even if you haven't seen it before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 0>So it's irregular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:14.290
<v Speaker 0>So and this just sort of reinforces the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.810
<v Speaker 0>How do children figure it out?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.329
<v Speaker 0>Well, from the rules and word's point of view this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.569
<v Speaker 0>is really straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:23.850
<v Speaker 0>You can have a very simple rule, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.170
<v Speaker 0>You can have a verb in a base form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.250
<v Speaker 0>You add ed and then you get the verb in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.290
<v Speaker 0>the past tense form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 0>Or if you write it as a rule then this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.010
<v Speaker 0>would just be v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:41.340
<v Speaker 0>Past goes to V, let's say base form and Eddie.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so super simple rule, which of course doesn't account

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.220
<v Speaker 0>for the, um, for the irregular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.340
<v Speaker 0>So you could assume that the irregular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 0>So this is for, uh, for the regular ones, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.660
<v Speaker 0>have this rule, and for the irregular ones, you just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.620
<v Speaker 0>stick it in the lexicon, hold in the lexicon as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.580
<v Speaker 0>the base form held in the lexicon, in the past

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,99]}

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.020
<v Speaker 0>form, the past tense form, and together with all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.500
<v Speaker 0>other stuff that sits in the lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.580
<v Speaker 0>What's the sound, what's the spelling, the meaning of, of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.300
<v Speaker 0>the verb and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.220
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.700
<v Speaker 0>That's really easy, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.980
<v Speaker 0>Or is there a potential problem in this story?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,65,95,100]}

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.180
<v Speaker 0>You just assume more lexical entries to cover the irregular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 0>verbs, the regular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Speaker 0>You can just write a rule what's what can go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:33.940
<v Speaker 0>wrong?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.940
<v Speaker 0>So the problem is that nothing prevents me from applying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.990
<v Speaker 0>this rule also to the irregular ones, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,76]}

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.070
<v Speaker 0>So I can apply it to this lexical entry and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 0>get hold it as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,67]}

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 0>As well as health which is already in the lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.790
<v Speaker 0>So irregular ones are stored as words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.750
<v Speaker 0>A rule generates the regular past tenses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.870
<v Speaker 0>And then how do I avoid hold it and steal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,38]}

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.430
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 0>And the answer that linguists normally give.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 0>Well, if a form already exists in the lexicon, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 0>the rule is blocked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 0>So somehow you need to assume a mechanism that before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 0>you apply this rule here you check the lexicon whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.830
<v Speaker 0>the output already exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.030
<v Speaker 0>So whether there is already a past tense form for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.110
<v Speaker 0>hold, for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 0>And then you don't apply this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:31.630
<v Speaker 0>So you have some mechanism that prevents you from applying,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.590
<v Speaker 0>uh, applying this rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100,100]}

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.890
<v Speaker 0>And um, well, this works as a mechanism, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.530
<v Speaker 0>not really an explanation, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.010
<v Speaker 0>So it's actually a bit ugly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 0>And it's also something that you don't, you know, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 0>outside the grammar and the lexicon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.450
<v Speaker 0>It's an extra thing that you need to assume.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.090
<v Speaker 0>You see in in other places too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,99,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 0>So if you think about the process that turns an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.890
<v Speaker 0>animal into food.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.610
<v Speaker 0>So for example, you can say, I ate chicken tonight,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.770
<v Speaker 0>I will eat chicken tonight, but you can't say I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 0>will eat cow tonight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.130
<v Speaker 0>You have to say I'll eat beef tonight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.010
<v Speaker 0>So there's this process that turns an animal into an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.570
<v Speaker 0>animal word into a food word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 0>But it's blocked for things like beef and pork and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 0>maybe game as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100]}

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.050
<v Speaker 0>So the blocking happens in other parts of the lexicon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.410
<v Speaker 0>as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 0>But it's it's an unexplained mechanism basically that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.290
<v Speaker 0>to assume.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 0>And this already tells you, well, maybe there's something not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 0>so great about the words and rules account if it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.820
<v Speaker 0>needs to rely on stuff like blocking as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay, but let's look at what actually happens during language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.340
<v Speaker 0>acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.020
<v Speaker 0>So you can obviously study what children do at a

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 0>certain age.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.180
<v Speaker 0>So these are examples from preschoolers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 0>And you can look at the verb form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 0>So they say things like it was neat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.940
<v Speaker 0>You should have seen it instead of seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,36,100,100,100,94]}

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.900
<v Speaker 0>So this sounds like an irregular verb but it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.540
<v Speaker 0>the right one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 0>Doggy bad to me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,39,95,100]}

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.180
<v Speaker 0>Rather than beat me again, this is an irregular one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,46,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.820
<v Speaker 0>but somehow the child has picked up the wrong form,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.540
<v Speaker 0>or maybe generated the wrong form using some sort of

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 0>rule that the Cheerios got eaten by Maki instead of

<v Speaker 0>eaten.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 0>I know how to do that.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 0>I truck myself well, truck is an irregular version of

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 0>trick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.940
<v Speaker 0>Trick truck like stick stuck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,99]}

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 0>This is the best place I ever thought.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.640
<v Speaker 0>Rather than sad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90]}

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so children actually do make mistakes like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, quite frequently at least, uh, in the early

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.240
<v Speaker 0>years.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, these don't suddenly stop when children start school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, the, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.760
<v Speaker 0>It it cannot all be education.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,99,97,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 0>I mean, some of it is that children get corrected

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 0>at school, perhaps, but they persist making these these errors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 0>for quite a while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.080
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, it could be that certain, you know, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.920
<v Speaker 0>very infrequent past tense forms the children may never encounter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78,100,81,100,89]}

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.600
<v Speaker 0>So how are they going to learn those?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.680
<v Speaker 0>And maybe sometimes they just create them by analogy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 0>So this seems to be what is happening here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.560
<v Speaker 0>Like truck instead of tricked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92]}

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.880
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, stick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.280
<v Speaker 0>Stuck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.050
<v Speaker 0>Trick truck makes sense and is a bit like the

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.570

<v Speaker 0>rang.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.770
<v Speaker 0>Clang clang might be an overgeneralisation.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.490
<v Speaker 0>So we see these patterns, and it's also interesting in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.330
<v Speaker 0>the sense that the types of error they change with

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:57.770
<v Speaker 0>time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.170
<v Speaker 0>And they're not just confined to plurals, so they overuse

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:09.290
<v Speaker 0>other processes like plural formation, man man's foot foods to

<v Speaker 0>Normally you just stick an s at the end of

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.250

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.370
<v Speaker 0>comparatives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.990
<v Speaker 0>So there's a lot of overgeneralisation and and morphological errors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 0>like that going on numerals one tooth instead of first

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.510
<v Speaker 0>and second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 0>They're quite creative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100]}

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.190
<v Speaker 0>Here's an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.150
<v Speaker 0>So parent says no booze in the house.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.590
<v Speaker 0>And the child says what's the booze?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,70]}

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 0>So they think booze is a plural.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.150
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.670
<v Speaker 0>It did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 0>It's new instead of it's node.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,98]}

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:08.350
<v Speaker 0>So again, one of these fake irregulars that can happen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.950
<v Speaker 0>as as errors in child language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so if you observe children over a longer period

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.310
<v Speaker 0>of time than you actually load a particular pattern, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.870
<v Speaker 0>is sometimes called the U-shaped curve in development.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.150
<v Speaker 0>So in the first stage, children produce both irregular and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.190
<v Speaker 0>irregular forms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 0>They don't make a lot of errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.830
<v Speaker 0>Also, they don't know a lot of verbs yet at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 0>that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.080
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 0>So they're still very young, I don't know, 15 months,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.080
<v Speaker 0>18 months, something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, then later on, uh, they produce a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,60,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 0>regular verbs and also try to regularise the irregular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.440
<v Speaker 0>So you would hear things like hold it and bite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.280
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 0>So suddenly you have a lot of errors and they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.040
<v Speaker 0>mostly overregulate like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,47,100,100]}

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.000
<v Speaker 0>And then later on the errors reduce again, and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.320
<v Speaker 0>children have mastered both the regular and the irregular form,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,83,100,83,100,100]}

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.600
<v Speaker 0>and the errors go down and close to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.760
<v Speaker 0>So if you if you draw this here, you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.000
<v Speaker 0>time on, on the x axis and proportion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.440
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 0>Here on the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.960
<v Speaker 0>Then initially there's a lot of correct forms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.320
<v Speaker 0>Then they go down a lot of errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.720
<v Speaker 0>And then there's again a lot of correct forms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.140
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually a general pattern that you will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 0>see in other domains as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.860
<v Speaker 0>It's not just for past tense, it's not just for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 0>language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 0>There's this U-shaped curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.660
<v Speaker 0>And let's try to figure out why we see this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 0>U-shaped curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 0>What is going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.620
<v Speaker 0>So why do the errors first increase and then decrease

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.060
<v Speaker 0>again?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.020
<v Speaker 0>And where is my wall club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,45,98]}

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.940
<v Speaker 0>So let's assume there's a few stages that happen during

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.820
<v Speaker 0>language acquisition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 0>And that corresponds to the different elements of the U-shaped

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 0>curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.300
<v Speaker 0>So we have our curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.100
<v Speaker 0>And then we have four stages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.030
<v Speaker 0>Um What do these stages correspond to?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 0>So we're basically assuming that different mechanisms are engaged during

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 0>those four stages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.830
<v Speaker 0>So irregular past tense forms are memorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 0>Past tense forms are generated using rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 0>All past tense forms are memorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.910
<v Speaker 0>Regular past tense forms are generated using rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 0>So which, uh, which order would you have to assume

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 0>so that you get this pattern?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.070
<v Speaker 0>Arrow first goes down and then first goes up and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.070
<v Speaker 0>then goes down again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'll give you another 30s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.330
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 0>So the most frequent answers answer is regular past tense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.930
<v Speaker 0>forms are generated using rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.410
<v Speaker 0>Then all past tense forms are generated using rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.330
<v Speaker 0>And then irregular past tense forms are memorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 0>And then all past tense forms are memorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.850
<v Speaker 0>So that doesn't sound right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.170
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.410
<v Speaker 0>Because you would have to assume that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.450
<v Speaker 0>Uh let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100]}

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.090
<v Speaker 0>So regular past tense forms so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,100]}

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.180
<v Speaker 1>We.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.100
<v Speaker 0>Don't get errors and then you get more errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 0>Irregular forms and memories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,35]}

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.820
<v Speaker 0>And this would actually produce the patterns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,93]}

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.340
<v Speaker 0>But of course the problem is why do you abandon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:48.940
<v Speaker 0>the rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.180
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't seem like a very plausible assumption that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.580
<v Speaker 0>start with rules and then you move from there to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 0>memorising everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.780
<v Speaker 0>So presumably it's the other way round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 0>So the the correct answer is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.380
<v Speaker 0>Hold on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.180
<v Speaker 0>This is the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 0>So all past tense forms are memorised whether they're regular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.540
<v Speaker 0>or irregular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.940
<v Speaker 0>I can of course also memorise the irregular ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.500
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.300
<v Speaker 0>Like walked liked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,95]}

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 0>But it doesn't matter whether regular or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.430
<v Speaker 0>I just put everything in the lexicon and then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 0>have very high correctness, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85]}

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.110
<v Speaker 0>So here's correctness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.270
<v Speaker 0>So I mean this in this stage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:48.510
<v Speaker 0>But then the child suddenly realises, well, there's really many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.270
<v Speaker 0>more verbs than I can care to memorise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.990
<v Speaker 0>And there is actually a regularity as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,54,96,100,100]}

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.030
<v Speaker 0>I can just tick ed on things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,47,71,100,100]}

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.430
<v Speaker 0>So let's forget all the memorised forms, and instead just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.070
<v Speaker 0>use this rule and generate all the forms regular or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.750
<v Speaker 0>irregular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.550
<v Speaker 0>And that explains the overgeneralisation, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 0>The the application that gives you bite and held it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,44,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.390
<v Speaker 0>and hold it and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.950
<v Speaker 0>But of course, the error rate, the correctness goes down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 0>So I'm down here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.290
<v Speaker 0>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 0>Then the opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.490
<v Speaker 0>Potentially the child tries the opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 0>It tries to memorise all the forms, but then it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:47.810
<v Speaker 0>acquires this blocking principle and realises that some past tense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.330
<v Speaker 0>forms are acquired, are generated using rules and some are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.010
<v Speaker 0>memorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 0>And then that's a possibility.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 0>That's a way of getting everything correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.170
<v Speaker 0>You can generate all the regular verbs and even the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.690
<v Speaker 0>ones you haven't seen before, but the irregular ones you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 0>need to memorise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.170
<v Speaker 0>And for that, you also need to apply the blocking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 0>principle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:16.490
<v Speaker 0>So it's basically memorising everything, acquiring the rule and over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.930
<v Speaker 0>generalising, then realising that the rule doesn't apply to all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.370
<v Speaker 0>the all the verbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.490
<v Speaker 0>And then you increase the correctness again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 0>So and this is nice because it makes use of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.180
<v Speaker 0>this distinction between rules and lexical items.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:35.660
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.420
<v Speaker 0>Between things that are stored.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.180
<v Speaker 0>And you can just retrieve as a, as a chunk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 0>and things that are generated on the fly using a

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Speaker 0>rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 0>So more generally this is known as a knowledge acquisition

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.900
<v Speaker 0>problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.900
<v Speaker 0>Where does the knowledge come from.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.410

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.990
<v Speaker 0>And then there's another bunch of philosophers, Locke, Berkeley, Hume,

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.870

<v Speaker 0>And this distinction between rationalism and empiricism mirrors the distinction

<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93]}

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.300

<v Speaker 0>In evolutionary terms, it's a cultural skill, which is amazing

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:10.060

<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 0>If if I know how to read, then it's something

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.470

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:21.870
<v Speaker 0>It's it works unconsciously in the sense that if I

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.070
<v Speaker 0>I cannot consciously avoid reading it.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.990
<v Speaker 1>And, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,92]}

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:37.670
<v Speaker 0>It's also extremely fast, faster than listening and speaking, actually.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 0>So the reading rate of the average adult is about

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.950

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.510
<v Speaker 0>So it's pretty amazing since something like that isn't innate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:36.050

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.020
<v Speaker 0>They are good at recognising emotions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,47,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:04.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.460
<v Speaker 0>So this is really a preview for Thursday's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.800
<v Speaker 0>So this is an approach that emerged in the 1980s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, and yes, so some people think deep learning is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 0>sort of, you know, started with Jeff Hinton in 2015

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.080
<v Speaker 0>or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.000
<v Speaker 0>But it's actually a lot older.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.600
<v Speaker 0>The technology was invented in the 1980s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.920
<v Speaker 0>Some aspects even earlier than that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.120
<v Speaker 0>And it started with a book called Parallel Distributed Processing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 0>and actually two volumes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 0>The first one contains models, the second one contains.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.920
<v Speaker 0>Well, the first one contains models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.920
<v Speaker 0>The second one contains architectures, particular architectures like recurrent neural

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 0>networks or feedforward neural networks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.720
<v Speaker 0>And in particular contains the the training algorithm back propagation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,66]}

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.800
<v Speaker 0>that is used to this day for training neural networks,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 0>even modern ones like transformers that weren't invented yet in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 0>the 80s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 0>And we'll actually talk about back propagation on Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,52,100,100]}

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, it was called parallel distributed processing, which is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.770
<v Speaker 0>really a name that people use at this point, parallel

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:27.210
<v Speaker 0>because it contains, well, the networks, they contain lots of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:33.010
<v Speaker 0>simple independent computations and distributed because the information is distributed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.010
<v Speaker 0>across the network.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 0>It's not represented in an easily accessible way, but it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.730
<v Speaker 0>uses these so-called distributed representations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100]}

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 0>And that's still the case for today's networks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 0>And we'll actually see examples later on in the course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.090
<v Speaker 0>when we talk about semantic embeddings, which are examples of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.810
<v Speaker 0>these distributed representations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 0>And so he isn't on on this on the title,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:03.010
<v Speaker 0>but uh, Geoff Hinton, who I already mentioned and who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.610
<v Speaker 0>obviously just got the Nobel Prize, um, he was one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.170
<v Speaker 0>of the authors of the PDP books.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:09.490
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:13.070
<v Speaker 0>He's is actually the author of several articles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.070
<v Speaker 0>The books contain a bunch of different articles for different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.550
<v Speaker 0>models, and he's the author of several of those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.990
<v Speaker 0>Incidentally, he did his PhD in Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.550
<v Speaker 0>So no bragging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 0>But, um, anyway, so why do we care?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.910
<v Speaker 0>We care because if you believe in this distinction between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:40.630
<v Speaker 0>radical, between empiricism and rationalism, then neural networks or PDP

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.950
<v Speaker 0>or deep learning or whatever you want to call it,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:48.950
<v Speaker 0>is an incarnation of empiricism in the most radical possible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 0>way, in that you assume a very simple architecture, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 0>we'll get to know the architecture on Thursday and Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 0>We start with a very simple one called a perceptron.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 0>Then we make it slightly more complicated, called a feed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,58]}

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.150
<v Speaker 0>forward network, which is basically an assembly of assembly of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.990
<v Speaker 0>perceptrons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:13.360
<v Speaker 0>So you have this very general architecture and you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.800
<v Speaker 0>a very general learning algorithm, backpropagation or gradient descent more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 0>generally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.280
<v Speaker 0>And this is it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 0>Basically this is the technology that can do all these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.560
<v Speaker 0>amazing things, from image recognition to controlling a robot to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.720
<v Speaker 0>ChatGPT and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 0>And you need that and you need a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.360
<v Speaker 0>data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.680
<v Speaker 0>Well, and a lot of compute ultimately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 0>But it is basically assuming a blank slate where you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.640
<v Speaker 0>only have this powerful architecture and the powerful learning algorithm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to have anything language specific, anything specific

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 0>to vision or motor control for all the domains, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.320
<v Speaker 0>can use the same architecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.920
<v Speaker 0>And that is pretty amazing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.360
<v Speaker 0>In the 1980s, people couldn't really exploit it because we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.040
<v Speaker 0>didn't have the the compute and we didn't have the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.040
<v Speaker 0>data and we didn't have the training algorithms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.890
<v Speaker 0>But then in the 2000 People had all these things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.090
<v Speaker 0>and then, well, the rest is history.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so to summarise, we looked at the past tense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 0>as a simple way of analysing and modelling language acquisition,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 0>sort of a fruit fly, a model organism, a very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.970
<v Speaker 0>simple mechanism that we can study and we'll actually come

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.370
<v Speaker 0>back to next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, we looked at children's acquisition of the past tense

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.570
<v Speaker 0>and of irregular things in the language in general, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:44.450
<v Speaker 0>we saw these stages that give you a U-shaped curve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.130
<v Speaker 0>where initially they make very few errors, then they make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.850
<v Speaker 0>a lot of errors, and then they stop making errors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:50.330
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.210
<v Speaker 0>And we explained this by saying they memorise everything first,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 0>then they discover the rule and then apply the rule

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.090
<v Speaker 0>to everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.090
<v Speaker 0>And then they recognise that the rule needs to apply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.890
<v Speaker 0>to certain things, but not to others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.170
<v Speaker 0>Some things need to be memorised, some things need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.010
<v Speaker 0>be rule based.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 0>And that is the official story of the words, word

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,81]}

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:09.350
<v Speaker 0>and rules framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 0>But starting next week, we look at the alternative story

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}
