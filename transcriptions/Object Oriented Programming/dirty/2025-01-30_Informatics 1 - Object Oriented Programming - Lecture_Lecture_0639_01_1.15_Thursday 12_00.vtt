00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 0>So ones like GitHub, Co-Pilot, intellisense.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 0>Um.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 0>Here is a file and read a Stack Overflow.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 0>data was a bit old, so you might extrapolate.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.330

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 0>you could help me with, um, looking and collecting data

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 0>to find some answers to this so you can volunteer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100]}

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 0>So I've got a QR code at the end that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.850

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 0>It's a very easy setup.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 0>It just requires you to run the executable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 0>It's it's pre-packaged, comes with questions, tests, um and integrated

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 0>it that you can run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 0>I've just got a little picture here if you'd like

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 0>to take a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 0>So this is what it would look like when you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,35,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 0>open the research software in your browser.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 0>So on the left hand side you would have preloaded

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 0>questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 0>These are based on the lab questions for the course.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 0>So you've got which one do I put.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,75,54,50]}

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 0>You've got a simple just reversing an array in here.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 0>You'd write your code in there you can click the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 0>run code button.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 0>And you would have a range of tests that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 0>can test your code on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 0>And on the right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 0>This would be where you talk to the coding assistant,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 0>and it would be able to see your code, see

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 0>the context, and give you tips on how you can

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 0>improve it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 0>So here is the QR code if you'd like to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 0>sign up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 0>I'll just leave that up for a minute.

<v Speaker 1>Thanks, Luke.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,81]}

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.830

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>with the course policy on JNI.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>So as Luke has said, how JNI can help develop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>your learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>As as a coda is really still is very experimental.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,76,100,100,100,51,100,100]}

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what Luke's doing research into.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.600
<v Speaker 1>So our policy in infancy at the moment is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I do not want you to use JNI.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to use them for assignments, but I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>don't recommend you use JNI for your practice, because what

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do is to learn to develop the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>skills yourself is really unclear whether you if you use

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>JNI too much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it is clear that you're not going to

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>get that full skill development.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100]}

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to get involved in this project

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>with Luke, what are you going to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to work with that group of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840
<v Speaker 1>this interacts with your learning to make sure that you're

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>not doing all your learning with JNI, but in some

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>cases, to to work with Luke on his research, you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>will be using JNI.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>But in general, I don't want you to be using

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.400

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>do these basic skills yourself.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so, um, sign up if you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.010
<v Speaker 1>at any stage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And I will answer them on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,84]}

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So just to go back to what we were talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.270
<v Speaker 1>about last time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So last time we were looking at objects, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Why do we do object oriented programming?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.990
<v Speaker 1>What is an object?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 1>How do you create an object and how does that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.550
<v Speaker 1>relate to classes?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so there's just a couple of things to finalise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>from this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>So we looked at using methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And the notation you use for methods is is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.950
<v Speaker 1>dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So what this means is this is the method start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.790
<v Speaker 1>engine is the method that I want to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And I want to use I want to apply that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 1>method to this object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm starting the engine of this car.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You always have the round brackets for the arguments to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>go in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there will be actual arguments that you need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 1>be in there, sometimes that will be empty, that will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.670
<v Speaker 1>be defined, and you need to know the method definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.990
<v Speaker 1>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to know the method definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.670
<v Speaker 1>You need to know the signature to see what arguments

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.790
<v Speaker 1>the method would expect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,100]}

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And IntelliJ will always be able to tell you that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And but here we also saw earlier we saw this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 1>application dot here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100]}

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is applying a method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 1>But math is not an object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Math is a class, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So this essentially what this means is you're calling method

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.720
<v Speaker 1>random on the class math.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90]}

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>That means there is a method called random that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>defined within the maths class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100]}

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want you to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.200
<v Speaker 1>So that is what that means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the same operator but it can be used either

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>on instances, which means do this to that instance or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.840
<v Speaker 1>it can be used in classes, which means this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.680
<v Speaker 1>where you'll find the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Um, so instance methods are associated in object um, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,96,98,100]}

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>you need the object name to say what you're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.000
<v Speaker 1>to apply it to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Whereas class methods are associated with a class that's fairly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>explanatory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Class methods are globally available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>That means that you um, that means that you anywhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.000
<v Speaker 1>within the class, you can use it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you need to import things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>We'll be looking at that later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to use things from a different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 1>class you can import that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>And then that means your code can see any of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 1>these, um, class methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>They're also static.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh, we'll get on to explain a bit what that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.210
<v Speaker 1>means in future lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 1>But for now, just just remember that they're static.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Um, so static, static behaviour, which which is to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,75,72,78,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 1>with how much you can change how things behave.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.490
<v Speaker 1>But there's also static states, which means things can't change

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>states easily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful for constants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Um, so global constants um this is a global constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So in within math we're defining this constant pi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make this final because we don't want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.810
<v Speaker 1>anybody to be able to change pi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Pi is just a thing that's always going to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.730
<v Speaker 1>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Um, and we're declaring it public static and final.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And that that means the public.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,97]}

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>This means that it's a global constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 1>And we'll be practising these these modifiers a lot more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.730
<v Speaker 1>in future lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.370
<v Speaker 1>So just to go back to why object orientation is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>important is this is the dominant paradigm in programming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>That is because it's really helpful for good software engineering

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.100
<v Speaker 1>principles, because it's used to objects used to model real

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,91,99,100,100]}

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.140
<v Speaker 1>world domains, or real world entities and domain concepts, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the way in which these change is much slower than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,86,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the way in which the world in general evolves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.380
<v Speaker 1>So object oriented object orientation puts things together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>That's changes together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you if you want to say something different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.940
<v Speaker 1>about cars, if you want to develop the behaviour of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 1>objects, there's a specific place that you do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>That is in the class definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's all clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It's clear where it comes from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And once you make changes in there, that filters out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.340

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.680

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.360
<v Speaker 1>The more you do this, the more I just have

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.760

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so now we are looking at testing and debugging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So the rule of thumb is coding is that there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,70,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.810
<v Speaker 1>usually an error in your code somewhere.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 1>So when you're just beginning coding, a lot of people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 1>have the feeling that, okay, mistakes is something you make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.370
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And as you get better at coding, you're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>know how to do this properly and you won't be

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.210
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes very often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.290
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely not how coding works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Making mistakes and coding is absolutely part of what happens

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Code gets really complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 1>The logic gets really complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy to make mistakes and it's basically impossible

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.090
<v Speaker 1>quite frequent mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.690
<v Speaker 1>That's inevitable, and it can be a massive problem if

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you release code to tons of people, which has got

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.970
<v Speaker 1>fundamental errors in it, then that's a huge problem.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Well, what we do about this is we try and

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.579
<v Speaker 1>avoid them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And if we and if they exist, if they do

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>come along and we try and fix them, okay.

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:13.819
<v Speaker 1>But first of all, looking at the there's three, three

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.900

<v Speaker 1>errors okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.380
<v Speaker 1>So syntax errors are kind of like a spelling mistake.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.699

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 1>it's usually something you know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,75,75]}

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.180
<v Speaker 1>You just do it carelessly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 1>You forget something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Um using an IDE, this is.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>These are pretty easy to pick up.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:37.900
<v Speaker 1>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Um, syntax errors are usually not picked up before you

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.320
<v Speaker 1>run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a syntax error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.920

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.080

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.880

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.960

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you're doing it the command line when you

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.800

<v Speaker 1>If you're doing IntelliJ it just won't let you run

<v Speaker 1>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Um so usually these are fairly easy to identify, particularly

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:12.720

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's not always the case.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on here?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.080
<v Speaker 1>So this is the this is the information it gives

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you is a little bit unclear exactly what that means.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Um, so and exactly what that means I'm not going

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.480
<v Speaker 1>to go into details, but the point is it gives

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you error messages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Usually these are pretty clear, but sometimes it's a little

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>bit hard to understand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 1>So runtime errors maybe that's a bit more like a

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>grammar mistake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Um, and this means you can compile it and you

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.170

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.170

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 1>So this is your classic obvious entry level runtime error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at this several times before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for something in the in at index for

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.010
<v Speaker 1>That's for long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>When we know an array that is for long, the

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.210
<v Speaker 1>the biggest index of the end index is going to

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 1>be three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>So this does not exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>But you can compile it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to show up errors in the in

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>IntelliJ because that is there's no syntax error.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 1>But when it runs it's going to be trying to

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 1>do something that's impossible and that's going to fail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get an error message.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.970
<v Speaker 1>So this would say we've seen this before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.370

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Logical errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So most of the time the kinds of errors you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.330
<v Speaker 1>going to get are logical errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So this means the Java is syntactically correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,48,73,100,100]}

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And the Java is doing exactly what you have told

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.890
<v Speaker 1>it you want it to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,97,100,100]}

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.690
<v Speaker 1>But what you've told it to do is not actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.740
<v Speaker 1>quite what you really meant to tell it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So you thought you were giving correct instructions, but actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.140
<v Speaker 1>your instructions were either not clear or not quite correct,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's doing something wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 1>So here we've got a classic example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.140

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 1>We've got for example the statement this one is an

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.220
<v Speaker 1>orange bird.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly reasonable thing to say in English.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It just isn't true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a there's a logical error there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.820
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to get any help from IntelliJ

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.780
<v Speaker 1>with these errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.420
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a lot of help to find

<v Speaker 1>out where they are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's not going to tell you what these errors

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.740
<v Speaker 1>are because it doesn't know you've told it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.740
<v Speaker 1>That adding means subtraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's like, fine, this is this is how we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>defining this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.820
<v Speaker 1>This is working perfectly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to see where the logical error lies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look at some of these examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to try and run this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Now you can already say you can already see I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68,94,100]}

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.180
<v Speaker 1>got a syntax error here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Because there's lots of red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 1>IntelliJ is not happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.920
<v Speaker 1>You have something that's red, you can't run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's just it's it's it's just going to tell

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>me what the problems are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's saying, um, colon is expected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>If we look in here, it's going to tell me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's in line five I can see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 1>So and then problems further on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.200
<v Speaker 1>But this is coming out of a problem that happens

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.440
<v Speaker 1>earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.480
<v Speaker 1>So can anybody see what is the problem with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Any thoughts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So in the for loop instead of separating these by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.760
<v Speaker 1>semicolons I've separated them by commas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually weirdly something I do quite often

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.000
<v Speaker 1>even though I use Java quite a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So during semester, um, doesn't like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.280
<v Speaker 1>So you saw that there were when I had this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 1>comma in it's also saying, okay, there's a problem here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And the problem here is it can't resolve the symbol

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.440
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be a little bit careful when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no objective problem with this AI.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 1>The problem is because I've got this error up here.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.330

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.490

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Um, but that's not really the root of the problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.330
<v Speaker 1>If I'm just looking at this and say, can't resolve

<v Speaker 1>simple AI.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not that very helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I need to look back to here and say, oh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.250
<v Speaker 1>okay, this for statement is not right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Change that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And then these are going to resolve themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.570
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to look at the root of the

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It's going to spread out to lots of other problems

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.730
<v Speaker 1>later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So that is the first problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to try and run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.290
<v Speaker 1>So that is that is going to compile.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.490
<v Speaker 1>But when I run it I get an array index

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And why is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I think you should know why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.610
<v Speaker 1>This is something we've talked about quite a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.660
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100]}

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>So as we've seen before, we have to put length

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.300
<v Speaker 1>minus one, because the final index of an array is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.740
<v Speaker 1>at length minus one because it starts at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>So let's run this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.180
<v Speaker 1>So it runs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100]}

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no compile errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no runtime errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's telling me the smallest number of this array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I've made from 1 to 5 is five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So is that the answer that we want to get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.100
<v Speaker 1>No, that's not the answer we want to get because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.300
<v Speaker 1>that isn't true right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82]}

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.700
<v Speaker 1>So this is a logical error.

<v Speaker 1>Without any problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.940
<v Speaker 1>However, I didn't tell it to do what I actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.960

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.000

<v Speaker 1>But of course that shouldn't happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.120
<v Speaker 1>You only want to overwrite the current smallest number.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.320

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 1>number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.120
<v Speaker 1>This is the new smallest number, so I change that

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.160

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.800

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.450
<v Speaker 1>And you need to be really careful thinking about how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to manage that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Um, so you have a cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.620
<v Speaker 1>So first of all, you create a test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.540
<v Speaker 1>You run the test and that test fails.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So you create a so you create a new feature

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that's going to solve that problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You run the test and the test passes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to refactor which means you change

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:47.900
<v Speaker 1>the code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to run it through all the other tests

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and update your code and you've got it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.540
<v Speaker 1>This is a cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You keep testing whenever it fails, you keep refactoring the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.580
<v Speaker 1>code so that it's going to it's going to pass

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.660
<v Speaker 1>all of your tests.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look at this in practice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So we want the calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So this is something a slight extension of how we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.020
<v Speaker 1>have been using Java before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So here is a class called calculator right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And can you see anything that is missing from calculator

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that has been in all the other classes that we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>defined so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55]}

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56]}

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh, so it's so void.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So all of all of the methods in here are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.640
<v Speaker 1>returning something, so we don't know whether there's a void

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,52,100,100,100]}

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 1>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.920
<v Speaker 1>No, actually this isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So the class wouldn't have a return type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.080
<v Speaker 1>The methods would.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And they all do, and that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.760
<v Speaker 1>But what we don't have here is a main method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.160
<v Speaker 1>So in Java the main method is always the entry

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>point into any class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see normally in Java we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.160
<v Speaker 1>these little arrows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we use to run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.360
<v Speaker 1>There are no arrows here right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.000
<v Speaker 1>We can't run anything because there's no entry point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.280
<v Speaker 1>this class okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82]}

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You will often be defining classes like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no entry into them directly for the user, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the way into them is by calling these methods

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 1>from other from other classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So here we have calculator client.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.320
<v Speaker 1>This is a class that will use our calculator class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And this has a main method so it can be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.880
<v Speaker 1>run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 1>So let's use some of these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So in calculator we have three methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got add which adds two numbers together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Multiply which multiplies two two numbers together and increment all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.130
<v Speaker 1>which takes an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And it adds a, it adds a number an integer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 1>to every element of that array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And we pass in both the array and the number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that we want it to be incremented by.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with um add return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,74]}

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.250
<v Speaker 1>So we'll create a variable called add return which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.370
<v Speaker 1>going to be an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And we are going to we're going to send this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.170
<v Speaker 1>to add okay with two okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Give me two integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Cool okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.610
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't know what Add is right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Because it can only see inside this class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.490
<v Speaker 1>So um this is like there's no add right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,85,60,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Because add is in calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So what I need to do as we saw before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.410
<v Speaker 1>with maths I'm going to put calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Calculator ad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,76]}

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.580
<v Speaker 1>What this means is I want to use a method

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Speaker 1>ad from this class calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to create this variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to return it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not going to return it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Sorry I'm going to print it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Um I'm going to say um seven plus 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh equals and then I'm going to say whatever my,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.420
<v Speaker 1>my program tells me it equals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So let's run this, see what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.220
<v Speaker 1>So now you can see we've got the arrows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.020
<v Speaker 1>We can run this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to tell me seven plus 12 is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.100
<v Speaker 1>19 which is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Actually this is supposed to not work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.100
<v Speaker 1>But I just remembered I didn't put it back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,64,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay so but what if it what if it did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.460
<v Speaker 1>this right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not complaining about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 1>This is completely fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 1>There's no problem with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 1>But if I then go on to run this, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 1>going to tell me seven plus 12 is minus five,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:21.980
<v Speaker 1>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not the answer I was looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 1>This is a logical error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100]}

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And if I go back to here I can see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.220
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.240
<v Speaker 1>But what do I do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.600
<v Speaker 1>How do I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So how do I pick these up as I go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.400
<v Speaker 1>along?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Actually let's have a look at let's first of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.840
<v Speaker 1>look at the integer array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100]}

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to create an array called first array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to be an array of integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's just going to be let's just make it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.440
<v Speaker 1>12345.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And okay first of all I'm just going to print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And so we saw before you can't just print an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.400
<v Speaker 1>array that's going to print nonsense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You can do you can loop through an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 1>But there's also another way of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And actually some of you were using this method in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the tutorial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not one we've looked at yet, but it's one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.880
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's just the two strings method two strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 1>So I can do arrays dot two string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,37,99,77]}

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.200
<v Speaker 1>What this does is it turns an array into a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 1>string and then I can print it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So if I print that that's just going to print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.560
<v Speaker 1>the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to do now is I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.250
<v Speaker 1>to, um, call the method I want to use here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.210
<v Speaker 1>is increment all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's from the calculator class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's calculated dot increment all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,97,85,100,100]}

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And as always IntelliJ is really useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So it knows what methods are in the calculator class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to suggest what's possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Um and I'm going to send first array plus a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 1>number to increment it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:50.970
<v Speaker 1>For what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,93]}

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 1>What should I use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100]}

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Fine three okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,86,100]}

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to print out the new array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So remember we looked at this last time um here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 1>with adding I need to assign this to a particular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:09.890
<v Speaker 1>value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And then I need to return that value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Whereas because the change is local and the change will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.370
<v Speaker 1>only come back to me if I pick it up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.930
<v Speaker 1>in a return value, but with an array, because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.450
<v Speaker 1>changing things directly in memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to send anything back and pick that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 1>up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I just can print out the array rate again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,43,99]}

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Um, so these two lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I've got to do two string again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,94,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Um, so these two lines are exactly the same, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.820
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be doing something different, because in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 1>meantime, I've gone off to another place and I've messed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.900
<v Speaker 1>around in memory changing what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>So I could do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,91,100,100]}

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So here we can see this is the same array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh, increased by a certain amount by three, in fact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.100
<v Speaker 1>So but we've got this problem here, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Seven plus 12 is minus five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So this we don't want this to happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>So we want to write code that will make sure

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,47,100,100]}

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.460
<v Speaker 1>either this doesn't happen or we're going to pick it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 1>up if things do happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So we so we were able to tell that something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.860
<v Speaker 1>had happened because we printed out a statement and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 1>could we we'd set it up so we can see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.820
<v Speaker 1>okay, this is telling us something that's clearly not true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's clearly a useful thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>If I hadn't done this and I was using this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 1>number and other things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100]}

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I might not know that this problem had happened, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,72,74,100]}

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 1>this is helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 1>However, print statements are kind of messy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>They mess up the output and you can only really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.120
<v Speaker 1>see them internally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's other ways to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Um, we can let's just comment that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So one way of doing this is by using assert.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to say assert add return is equivalent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>to seven plus 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.560
<v Speaker 1>So normally I'd want to do this in a more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.240
<v Speaker 1>general way with that with not with these specific numbers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,68,88,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>hardcoded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.080
<v Speaker 1>But to make it easier, I'm going to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying this is what should happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want this code to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>So whatever add return is it should be equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>this right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86]}

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 1>So within assert you put in what you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:15.680
<v Speaker 1>be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And then you put a colon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>And colon means otherwise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.800
<v Speaker 1>If this is not the case you print out a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.120
<v Speaker 1>message.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.720
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to say error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Seven plus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,93]}

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Plus 12 is return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51]}

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It's given the value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to say whatever that value is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to run this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 1>So here this is causing an exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's telling me what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It's telling me this is the error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So that is much more useful when you're debugging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So you can see this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.290
<v Speaker 1>You can put in whatever you want the error to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 1>be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 1>So this is another way of helping it be easy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.090
<v Speaker 1>to find errors in your code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Um, but there is a more common way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And this is using tests.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89]}

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 1>These are these are unit tests.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,66,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:10.929
<v Speaker 1>We will be using these um, in we'll be using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.530
<v Speaker 1>these in inform be um, but you're not writing them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,51,96,100,45,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.250
<v Speaker 1>in form B, although they're actually really quite straightforward to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67,90,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.610
<v Speaker 1>write but you will be using them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.409
<v Speaker 1>That's important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So you can add as many tests as you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You can run all the tests, or you can just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.899
<v Speaker 1>run a test ad as you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,37,100,100,100]}

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So you indicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.300
<v Speaker 1>So this is in a class which would usually be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.379
<v Speaker 1>called something test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.179
<v Speaker 1>And then you indicate each test with this at test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And that means that um IntelliJ or Java knows where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.700
<v Speaker 1>these tests are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh these are always void.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,97]}

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.580
<v Speaker 1>You give them names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Um, so which should often I mean, this kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.780
<v Speaker 1>normal nomenclature is quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Say you tell it what you want it to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 1>So what I want this to do I want calculator

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:55.500
<v Speaker 1>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.620
<v Speaker 1>So this is an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Say if I send one and two to a calculator

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 1>what I expect is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.580
<v Speaker 1>This is what what it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.780
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want the answer to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Um and assert equals means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh, so so I'm saying these should be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Result and expected should be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm setting up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.860
<v Speaker 1>This is my test condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what the answer should be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's actually going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And these really should be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And these are not the same as a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,96,100]}

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So if I run that okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's going to that's not happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's telling me there's a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's saying here are some not as expected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,35,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>That's because that's what I told it to print out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I expected the answer to be three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.120
<v Speaker 1>That's because this is how I told it to calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 1>But actually the answer is minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.320
<v Speaker 1>So these tests are really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So you can either just run specific ones or you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.920
<v Speaker 1>can run everything on the whole class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And this is saying great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>There's three tests.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 1>One of them is failed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,45,100]}

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Two of them have passed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So overall you get this cross for the whole class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Test class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 1>That means that there is at least one test in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 1>there that hasn't passed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And intelligent indicates this by the red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.920
<v Speaker 1>The red exclamation marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.720
<v Speaker 1>So main methods can be used to quickly evaluate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.680
<v Speaker 1>functionality of your code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was doing with the print statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,70,100,100]}

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.800
<v Speaker 1>As you're going along, you might want to just quickly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.240
<v Speaker 1>check things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Just check what things are look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,83,100]}

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Um, then that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100]}

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Just to put it in print statements, but that's fairly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:21.290
<v Speaker 1>limited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 1>They have a few drawbacks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It requires manual effort.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89]}

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.210
<v Speaker 1>It's more error prone than doing proper testing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 1>So assertions are kind of helpful with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.810
<v Speaker 1>We've seen these assertions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,100]}

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>However, the tests are unorganised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.970
<v Speaker 1>We're just putting them in in your coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no easy way to only test certain methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to see everything all at once.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So the easiest way to do this is a test

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:45.770
<v Speaker 1>framework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And the test framework is the test class that we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:48.770
<v Speaker 1>just seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So how do you decide what you're going to test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So in the example we looked at we were testing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 1>whether addition was working.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100]}

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 1>We just put in one plus two equals three right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.970
<v Speaker 1>If that's working that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And you should do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You should put in general cases things that are quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.570
<v Speaker 1>normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Um, regular use cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Make sure those are returning the right thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 1>But also you have to think about corner cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.170
<v Speaker 1>What are the slightly weird cases that might happen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 1>So when you're doing things with numbers, this is very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.570
<v Speaker 1>often zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Um, it might be that, uh, things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Is it handling negative numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So you need to think about what are all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.100
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you put a really large number in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.820
<v Speaker 1>So you need to think about what are the ones

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that might cause something slightly different and put in test

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.940
<v Speaker 1>examples for those as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Um, what happens about invalid inputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,91]}

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.100
<v Speaker 1>So what happens if, um, I am doing something with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 1>addition or I'm expecting integers and actually somebody send me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.300
<v Speaker 1>a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.380
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do with that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,51,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to respond to that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Um, and you also need to look at positive testing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.980
<v Speaker 1>as well as negative testing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.580
<v Speaker 1>So that means is it doing things right that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:54.980
<v Speaker 1>should be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Is is it succeeding when you want it to succeed?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.540
<v Speaker 1>But also does it fail when you want it to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.580 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 1>fail?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>So things failing is often really important in coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Like if this doesn't work, then you go off and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.060
<v Speaker 1>do something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.060
<v Speaker 1>You need to make sure it's failing at that point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.380
<v Speaker 1>when you want it to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So make sure you put in those examples as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.900
<v Speaker 1>So one of the important things about writing good code

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.620
<v Speaker 1>is being able to figure out how you should test

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it and testing it really robustly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And usually when things go wrong, when code is released,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it's because people haven't thought about specific cases and haven't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>tested those cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They've just assumed that the cases they've tested it on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.400
<v Speaker 1>cover pretty much everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.160
<v Speaker 1>And they and they don't always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.520
<v Speaker 1>So first of all, you want to test that your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.000
<v Speaker 1>code is is running fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100]}

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.720
<v Speaker 1>And usually hopefully it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 1>But if it isn't what do you do then you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.360
<v Speaker 1>have to debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes this is super obvious right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.520
<v Speaker 1>If you have a function called add and you notice

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a minus in there, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't need any complex skills to debug that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.120
<v Speaker 1>But when it's bigger than a test case, debugging can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.960
<v Speaker 1>be quite challenging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look again at IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Rotate debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So this is code uh which is taking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,48,100,100,99]}

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'm creating this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,95,100,100,100]}

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm doing is I'm what I'm intending to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>do is rotate it right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.450
<v Speaker 1>So it starts off one, two, three, four, five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.330
<v Speaker 1>What I want it to do is to return an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,88,100,100,100,100,100,48]}

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:20.810
<v Speaker 1>array to me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100]}

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>That is five, four, three, two, one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So everything's backwards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,99]}

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.770
<v Speaker 1>So let's run that and see if that's what it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:26.130
<v Speaker 1>does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It returns 51111.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's got the it's brought the final one to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>the first position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 1>But after that it has kind of messed up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do this, but I haven't got

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:45.690
<v Speaker 1>a pen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just going to do this on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use a chalkboard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,76,79,100,99,100]}

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I haven't used a chalkboard for years.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay, let's see if I can write on the chalkboard

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 1>an intelligible way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so one way you can do this is just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.530
<v Speaker 1>go by three by hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,76,100,100]}

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And if you've been in the tutorial or you go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.890
<v Speaker 1>to church today or tomorrow, you'll see there's a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.890
<v Speaker 1>of practice where we just go through through things by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,69,85,100,100]}

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 1>hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And this can be really helpful just to just got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,56,38,100,58]}

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 1>a few things down to give you an idea.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.690
<v Speaker 1>So my array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Is oh God Go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,70,73]}

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 1>One.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so I is equal to I starting off at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:23.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>You can shout out that is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.260
<v Speaker 1>So what do I need to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what's in array zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.380
<v Speaker 1>And what's the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.620
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm saying that array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Array a I plus one which is array one is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:50.300
<v Speaker 1>equal to array zero which is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>So now at the end of this loop my array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.940
<v Speaker 1>is going to be what's my array going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.340
<v Speaker 1>11345.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell even from just going through ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61]}

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem here because two is completely vanished.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be able to put two into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.540
<v Speaker 1>the final answer at all because I've lost it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not keeping it anywhere, but I've got this duplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.340
<v Speaker 1>of one, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.350
<v Speaker 1>So right away I can see there's a problem going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 1>on somewhere here where I'm overwriting things that I need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.710
<v Speaker 1>to not be overwriting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.310
<v Speaker 1>That's really helpful for debugging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so that's one way you can do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Um, but there's also lots of super useful tools in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.070
<v Speaker 1>an IDE.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100]}

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.750
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Why is this just spinning?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh, come on IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's reboot IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh, rotate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so we're running that, and that was fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to put in debug points or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.230
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put in stop points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.150
<v Speaker 1>So you might have seen I quite often do this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.870
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to click on this I actually accidentally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:13.530
<v Speaker 1>click on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And this creates, in this case a red diamond.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you do it lower down it'll create a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,87,100,100]}

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 1>red circle okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is a stop point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And what this means is um, I want to I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 1>want to go through actually, let me just show you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.130
<v Speaker 1>this first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Um, so when you click the green arrow, we've always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.650
<v Speaker 1>just been choosing the first one which is just running

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.930
<v Speaker 1>But you see down here there's also debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So let's debug it okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's not telling us something very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,89,58,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Um let's say we put a stop point in here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is saying I want what I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:47.890
<v Speaker 1>see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.850
<v Speaker 1>That's because I'm, I'm not telling it to tell me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:51.810
<v Speaker 1>anything about the debugging.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm saying here, this is my stop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I want you to tell me what is happening here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So let's try debugging this again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.610 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Now we're getting all this information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that well enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh, also, I've just remembered I supposed to turn it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,99,88,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.650
<v Speaker 1>on to black.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,85,100]}

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Well, I'll leave that to the next lecture, but remind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 1>me to do it then, if I forget.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 1>So I hope this isn't too small to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.420
<v Speaker 1>But you can see it's telling me at this line

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:16.780
<v Speaker 1>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.860
<v Speaker 1>These are the values we've got, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So this is what the array looks like the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.100
<v Speaker 1>time we get here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's always going to be the first time around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,57,96]}

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.380
<v Speaker 1>The array dot length is five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Array zero is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Array one plus I plus one is two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the what is in position I plus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.180
<v Speaker 1>is two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And what is in position I is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Now you can see here are some these are these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.660
<v Speaker 1>are the um choices you can make.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.740
<v Speaker 1>So step over essentially step over and step into the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 1>ones you're going to use the most.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Step over is like I'm in a loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what happens in the sleep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to jump out of the sleep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what comes out of this loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Whereas step into means I want to go through this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.340
<v Speaker 1>loop and see what's happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So let's press step into okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So now you can see this is changing right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So we've got we've we've gone on to the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.900
<v Speaker 1>step of the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.340
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning we had I plus one was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 1>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 1>But now because of this assignment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I plus one equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And we can already now see this problem coming in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.510
<v Speaker 1>because this has changed the array to 113452 is disappeared

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100]}

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.550
<v Speaker 1>as we saw by hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 1>We can step into it further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's keep it keeps on making these changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,70,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is really helpful in seeing what goes wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to use that a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.550
<v Speaker 1>There's other things you can do with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So say for example I'm not interested in looking at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.150
<v Speaker 1>what happens when I equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's a particular point I'm concerned about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:40.150
<v Speaker 1>We can if we right click on this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Oops sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Why is this not coming up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's weird.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100]}

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Um, we can add a conditional breakpoint, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 1>So that means I say I don't want it just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>to break any time on this line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I want it to break under certain conditions, and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:03.710
<v Speaker 1>want it to break.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I want it to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,60,77]}

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at what happens when I is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.310
<v Speaker 1>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 1>So if if I is equivalent to two, then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.950
<v Speaker 1>want you to break.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Now we run through that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>And we will see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.530
<v Speaker 1>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That's because I chose run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And I should choose debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So it'll never give you debugging information, even with breakpoints,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.810
<v Speaker 1>unless you tell it you want it to debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So now when I run that debug, we see we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 1>already looking at the situation where I is two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,96,100,95,100]}

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:35.570
<v Speaker 1>already at this stage, um, the array is 1143.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,90]}

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's allowing us to look at a specific point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So these are super useful tools that you're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:39.970
<v Speaker 1>be using a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 1>So we've done all that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88]}

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.930
<v Speaker 1>So debugging strategies we've got the manual walkthrough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh we've got logging um which is uh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.810
<v Speaker 1>So you look at you walk through, you look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.450
<v Speaker 1>what's going on at each point or you use the

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 1>debugger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why this is.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God, what's wrong with my laptop at the

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.610
<v Speaker 1>moment?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why this isn't full screen.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do when you find errors?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 1>This is really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.020
<v Speaker 1>How do we handle invalid input for a start?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>This generates a sequence of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:18.500
<v Speaker 1>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 1>So what could go wrong here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.340
<v Speaker 1>What might be a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So we're testing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.980
<v Speaker 1>That starts as an end okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,65,88,100,73]}

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So one thing that can happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Invalid input.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.020
<v Speaker 1>So if we say the sequence is 7 to 15

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Speaker 1>is going to return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a sequence, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100,100]}

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But can somebody give me a number that's going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 1>cause a problem.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 1>19.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87]}

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So I run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,84,100]}

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a problem, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Because this is just assuming that start is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.460

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So I can simplest thing to do is to add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.460

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:10.470
<v Speaker 1>the way start Must be less than.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.430

<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.030
<v Speaker 1>So this is really quite useful for me when I'm

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.670

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not useful to anybody else.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.750

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.110

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.750

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's not always that useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.750
<v Speaker 1>What I can do, I can put in an if

<v Speaker 1>statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So if it's the case that start is bigger than

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.990

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.230

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to fail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Does something print out problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,77,96,100,98]}

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.910
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Anything else?

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99]}

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So I put it in the wrong place because I've

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.510

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.430
<v Speaker 1>then that's when.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh, God.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.490
<v Speaker 1>That's when the problem is going to come.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to get rid of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,78,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.610
<v Speaker 1>That's going to go right at the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So before I even try to create the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this in and run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.570
<v Speaker 1>So I get the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:20.770
<v Speaker 1>But I've got already this message coming through.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible at live debugging by the way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.610
<v Speaker 1>When you debug I recommend do not do it in

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 1>front of a whole class of people because it's really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,86,91,100,100,100]}

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:29.850
<v Speaker 1>stressful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So comments from the floor is super helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's a way of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a little bit more useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 1>But prints and you will use print statements to pick

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 1>up errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That's common, but it's not really a great solution for

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 1>finished code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.210
<v Speaker 1>For one thing, it's printing these things out all over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 1>the place, which is not necessarily what you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:45.650
<v Speaker 1>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So what what we do here is we use throw

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.570
<v Speaker 1>exception okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So we throw exceptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 1>We use a the method is throw.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to create a new instance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 1>So we use a keyword new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And then it's going to Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.490
<v Speaker 1>IntelliJ will give us some examples of what we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And what we want is a legal argument exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,86,100,100]}

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And then we send a message and it should be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,48,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 1>start, uh, should be less than end or whatever we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 1>want it to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 1>So when we run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.100
<v Speaker 1>That is going to throw this exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So this is a much more organised, clear way to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 1>do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.020
<v Speaker 1>You'll be able to see all the exceptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You've got this error message coming out which is attached

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.700
<v Speaker 1>to the specific, um, thing that you're looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So this is a much more organised way to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And we'll look at a lot more of that, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,44,100,66]}

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 1>over the time over, over the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,98]}

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So these are all examples of things that can go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:43.620
<v Speaker 1>wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.460
<v Speaker 1>You can have a look at these in more detail

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't contaminate the code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.660
<v Speaker 1>So which do you use for private methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.660
<v Speaker 1>We've not really looked at private methods but we will

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.220
<v Speaker 1>do later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You can use assertion if it helps you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else cares.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But for public methods you should be using these, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:01.820
<v Speaker 1>exceptions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay, let me just really quickly finish.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.750

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:06.270
<v Speaker 1>errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Um three different testing strategies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The three debugging strategies and the three kinds of error

<v Speaker 1>handling.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.710

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.670
