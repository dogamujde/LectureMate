00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:18.920
<v Speaker 0>in trying?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.000
<v Speaker 0>You're cutting off opportunities for things that you could do.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.400

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.800

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.360

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.760

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 0>You can cut the chain of the anchor and you

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.040

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.640
<v Speaker 0>So an anchor problem is something that essentially is fixable.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.000

<v Speaker 0>fix them.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.890
