<v Speaker 0>This is how we have to do it because we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
<v Speaker 0>want to make our materials available, but we're not allowed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.880
<v Speaker 0>to make learn available.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 0>So we have to have a learn page with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 0>assessment in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,49]}

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 0>We can't put the assessment on open course because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 0>too open.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 0>But all the materials are on on open course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 0>So if you go to open course everybody should be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.800

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040
<v Speaker 0>This is where most this is mostly what we use.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.800
<v Speaker 0>But you will need to go to learn for assessment

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 0>primarily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 0>And also this has got the technical things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.280
<v Speaker 0>And like the like the coursework planner.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Speaker 0>You can get all the information on assessment here.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.280
<v Speaker 0>But most of the materials are on the open course

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 0>So this tells you a little bit about what Thrombi

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 0>is all about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Now the important thing that I want to share with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 0>you is that this is about software engineering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.170
<v Speaker 0>This is a kind of like beginning to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 0>how you code from a kind of more of a

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 0>software engineering point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 0>So, yeah, so it's not really a software engineering course,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 0>but we're trying to develop those skills that are going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 0>to help you improve in that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 0>So it's all about coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.010
<v Speaker 0>It's all about learning to code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 0>But it's not just about hacking out code that works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.769
<v Speaker 0>It's about learning how to write good code, and it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 0>about learning how to communicate about code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.450
<v Speaker 0>And all of these things are really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's a huge mix of experiences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.890
<v Speaker 0>Some of you will have done advanced higher or or

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.290
<v Speaker 0>A-level, maybe doing Java as part of that, and we'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 0>know most of what's in this course, probably not all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.290
<v Speaker 0>of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.610
<v Speaker 0>And I would still encourage you to stay focussed, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.450
<v Speaker 0>that's you, because you might learn approaches and techniques that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 0>you don't already know, but you may know a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 0>of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.610
<v Speaker 0>Others of you haven't done any Java or any object

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 0>or object oriented programming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Speaker 0>Some of you have never done any coding at all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 0>before last semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.290
<v Speaker 0>That's also common.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 0>And then a lot of you in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.750
<v Speaker 0>So it's designed to suit all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 0>All of you obviously that's really difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 0>If you haven't done any coding before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 0>It is quite a steep learning curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 0>You will have a lot to do and keeping up

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.230
<v Speaker 0>to speed is really important with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 0>If you've done a lot before, you might find this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.430
<v Speaker 0>quite slow moving and quite easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 0>So that's kind of a nice, easy thing for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 0>You can just kind of take your foot off the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 0>in touch with the course and make sure you're paying

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 0>attention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 0>So the learning objectives are about implementing object oriented programming.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 0>But they're also demonstrating an awareness of good practice, being

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.110

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.270
<v Speaker 0>This is the course page.

<v Speaker 0>Start working through it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 0>So this is going to be your first task.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 0>You really should try to get this done this week.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.920

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280
<v Speaker 0>Go along to a lab session.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Speaker 0>We have lab sessions every day except Thursdays.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 0>Don't just get stuck with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.560
<v Speaker 0>So that's the first thing you need to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.680

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 0>is the schedule.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.960
<v Speaker 0>what's happening with tutorials, what labs you're supposed to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we're already starting on assessment, but so far

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 0>the assessment is fairly easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
<v Speaker 0>The bigger assessments are not going to kick in until

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 0>week five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 0>I think assessment one is, uh, released in week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,62,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.170
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.730
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 0>Week three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.970
<v Speaker 0>Week three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 0>Release.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.290
<v Speaker 0>Assessment one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 0>But at the moment we've got the quizzes starting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 0>So we do quizzes every week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 0>There's ten quizzes across the whole semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 0>One of these is the Getting Starter quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,51,100]}

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 0>And this is super easy if you've done the installation,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 0>because all you need to do is check to say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.410
<v Speaker 0>that you've done the installation and you already get 2%

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 0>of the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 0>So that's a really good place to start getting some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.050
<v Speaker 0>marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 0>And then every week we have a quiz which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.250
<v Speaker 0>really lightweight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 0>It shouldn't take you very long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 0>It's really just checking that you've accessed the lecture materials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 0>You have a kind of idea of where we are,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 0>you know, the basic core things that we're trying to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.290
<v Speaker 0>convey in the lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.650
<v Speaker 0>And then so all of these weekly quizzes together are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.410
<v Speaker 0>worth 20%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.570
<v Speaker 0>If you get over 80%, you get 2%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.770
<v Speaker 0>If you get between 50 and 79, you get 1%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 0>That sounds really demanding, but these should not be difficult

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.650
<v Speaker 0>questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.650
<v Speaker 0>It's just a matter of checking with the slides and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 0>then the assessment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>learn in a bit more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 0>So you'll find all of this on the on the

<v Speaker 0>open course under the schedule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 0>If you click on the individual week, then you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.190
<v Speaker 0>see this is where you can get the slides from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then there's tabs for assessment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 0>In the tutorials you can get all the tutorial material.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>We put solutions up here as you go through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.630
<v Speaker 0>So in retrospect you can look at the solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 0>But we don't release those until the tutorial itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.510
<v Speaker 0>Um so that's where you find those things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100]}

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.550

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.350

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 0>is also really annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.920

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 0>And that's a really, really useful part of learning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.240

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 0>but they usually hang back and don't answer questions immediately

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 0>because it's actually really useful for you guys to answer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.360
<v Speaker 0>each other's questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100]}

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.240
<v Speaker 0>And people get a lot of learning that done that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.400
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.280

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.880

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.560

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.240

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.080

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 0>And that's why people are anxious about it being completely

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.380
<v Speaker 0>anonymous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 0>But I don't think that's going to happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.300
<v Speaker 0>I think you can all be relied on to behave

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>So please behave responsibly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 0>And this is the assessment tab.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 0>So when you're doing any assessment this is where you

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 0>have to go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.620
<v Speaker 0>And you can see already the weekly quizzes are up

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:14.780
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.660
<v Speaker 0>This is and this is not what it looks like

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 0>for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.260
<v Speaker 0>I should have put in student preview.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 0>So for you there's just just loads less junk.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 0>So if you go to assessment you'll be able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 0>see the weekly quizzes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 0>You can click on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 0>You can start doing the Getting Started quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 0>I know a lot of you have already done that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 0>and the week one quiz is going to be available

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 0>after this lecture, possibly not immediately after this lecture, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 0>we're just kind of getting up to speed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.700
<v Speaker 0>But but soon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,99,99]}

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 0>So let me go to the introductory slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 0>I've got sort of two different lectures we're doing today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,94,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.100
<v Speaker 0>Probably should have just started straight off with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,63,100]}

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Speaker 0>so this is who we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 0>I've already talked for about ten minutes before even introducing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 0>myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.550
<v Speaker 0>So I'm Fiona.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 0>I'm the course organiser and I'm also a lecturer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.390
<v Speaker 0>I will do most of the lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 0>I've been teaching this course for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.510
<v Speaker 0>This is my fifth year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.710
<v Speaker 0>Now I really like this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 0>I really like working with first year students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 0>One of my main research interests is transition from school

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.990
<v Speaker 0>to university, which is actually kind of a hard transition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 0>It's such a different environment from school to uni.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 0>So we do what we can to kind of scaffold

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.550
<v Speaker 0>that change a bit, but I think it's still really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.510
<v Speaker 0>quite tough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 0>And you probably a lot of you will have found

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 0>that last semester and maybe continuing to find that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.390
<v Speaker 0>is really demanding you're treated in such a different way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 0>at university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.550
<v Speaker 0>So my research historically, my research was in AI and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 0>data integration, but I do more and more in computing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 0>education.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 0>So I'm really interested these days and how people learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 0>computing, how we can make inclusive environments in computing and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.070
<v Speaker 0>make it a bit more accessible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 0>So the other two lectures we have on Inf1 are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 0>James and Adriana, and they are both doing the assessment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 0>So they're going to be setting the assignments that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 0>do, and they will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 0>You may not meet them face to face, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.200
<v Speaker 0>will certainly be hearing from them later on as we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.800
<v Speaker 0>come to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 0>And then we have two course Tas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,90]}

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
<v Speaker 0>Uh, Crystal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,88]}

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 0>So those of you who are not Scottish may that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.640
<v Speaker 0>may be a bit counterintuitive how you pronounce the surname,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 0>but the z is not pronounced.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.240
<v Speaker 0>It's DL and colt and butter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,64,91,62]}

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.440
<v Speaker 0>So they're both fantastic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 0>Colt.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 0>And you'll see on Piazza a lot, uh, Chris is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 0>doing more of the assessment stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.960
<v Speaker 0>So they're always around to, to help you out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 0>So that's the team.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.200
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 0>This is my dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, I always say I really like pets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61,100,100,100,98]}

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.120
<v Speaker 0>I know students really love pets as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 0>When I sometimes teach remotely and the dog ever comes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.160
<v Speaker 0>in, everybody gets really excited about my dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.720
<v Speaker 0>So I put up a picture of my dog.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.560
<v Speaker 0>But what I'd really love to have is pictures of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.520
<v Speaker 0>other people's pets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.920
<v Speaker 0>So I usually do a pet of the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.560
<v Speaker 0>So if anybody has got a pet at home that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 0>you're kind of missing, um, and would like to show

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.240
<v Speaker 0>everyone, whether it's a dog or a gerbil or a

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 0>goldfish or whatever, or it doesn't even have to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.740
<v Speaker 0>your own pet, just any animal you're fond of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 0>Just email me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.700
<v Speaker 0>And every.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,89]}

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 0>Every lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.660
<v Speaker 0>I put up at least one pet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 0>But if you email it, it's not a competition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm not choosing the cutest pet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 0>If you email me a picture of your pet, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 0>will put it up at least at some stage through

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 0>the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.780
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77]}

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 0>So I always like to see at the beginning of

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 0>writing code, it's so familiar and you think you know

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.260

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.940
<v Speaker 0>a couple of weeks, you come back to it and

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.620
<v Speaker 0>you're like, oh God, what was I doing here?

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Speaker 0>If you've written it well, you will know.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Speaker 0>It'll just be really difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.220
<v Speaker 0>So it's all about how you write good code.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.460

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 0>all, being able to write good code is very important.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 0>Don't make more bad code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.300
<v Speaker 0>We're not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90]}

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.140
<v Speaker 0>It's not about hacking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 0>It's about design.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay, so you probably know all of this.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 0>We have the two lectures a week.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 0>They're all in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.950
<v Speaker 0>One tutorial a week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 0>They haven't done the allocations yet, I don't think.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.550
<v Speaker 0>This will be based largely in academic families like influencers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.230
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully the groups will be fairly similar that we

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.270

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.110
<v Speaker 0>But you should be with a lot of familiar people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, the approach is very different to anyone.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.990

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.270
<v Speaker 0>it in the tutorial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81]}

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.709
<v Speaker 0>Tutorials are not assessed, they are compulsory.

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:09.630
<v Speaker 0>We do take attendance.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.069
<v Speaker 0>If you're not attending, it'll be followed up.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.870

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.630
<v Speaker 0>problem for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.829
<v Speaker 0>If you're not, you know it's less of a problem,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 0>but it is a real problem for the course because

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.350
<v Speaker 0>this is absolutely fundamental to tutorials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,82]}

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.910
<v Speaker 0>So please go to the tutorials.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, a lot of them are about working with other

<v Speaker 0>people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.709
<v Speaker 0>We have pair programming that sort of stuff, discussing things

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:26.350
<v Speaker 0>in groups.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that kind of interaction is a really important

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.830
<v Speaker 0>We also have lab exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.750
<v Speaker 0>These are also not assessed, and that means that people

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 0>tend not to do them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 0>But this is where you get your practice in.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.760

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.440
<v Speaker 0>Do the lab exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.800
<v Speaker 0>We have the drop in labs five times a week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 0>lab exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to only ask about lab exercises during

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.520
<v Speaker 0>the lab sessions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.560
<v Speaker 0>You can ask about any aspect of the course, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.880
<v Speaker 0>the demonstrators in the labs will be particularly prepared to

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 0>help with the lab exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 0>If you've got questions about tutorials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.760
<v Speaker 0>Ask a tutor.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,100]}

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.560
<v Speaker 0>But if you've got general questions about the course, well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.600
<v Speaker 0>I'll probably put them on Piazza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.440
<v Speaker 0>But you can also ask the demonstrators.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 0>So the labs are in 606, um, which is an

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.600
<v Speaker 0>open lab.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 0>I've had complaints in the past from students that they

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.680
<v Speaker 0>went along and there were no demonstrators there.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.680
<v Speaker 0>That I don't think has ever actually been true, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.960
<v Speaker 0>sometimes it's really hard to see who the demonstrators are.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.760
<v Speaker 0>So you might think there's no demonstrators.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.280
<v Speaker 0>So I've told them that they need to wear badges.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.200
<v Speaker 0>So I've got to actually on my way back, I've

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.160
<v Speaker 0>got to go and pick up some stickers so that

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.200
<v Speaker 0>they can write their name on and then say that

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.000
<v Speaker 0>there are demonstrators.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,80,80]}

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 0>So they should be really easy to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you're having problems, please let me know and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.700
<v Speaker 0>I will harass them about doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 0>And then you have your weekly quizzes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.420
<v Speaker 0>You can earn badges, you earn a mastery badge if

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 0>you get 80% sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, 80% or over, which is your 2% of grades

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.100
<v Speaker 0>or making Progress badge if you get over 50.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 0>Some people love badges.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 0>I'm I'm such a sucker for gamification.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.140
<v Speaker 0>I always love to like, collect things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.180
<v Speaker 0>Some people don't care, but you also get your point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 0>So that's why we're doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 0>So also I put survey questions onto the weekly quizzes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.180
<v Speaker 0>just to touch in to see how people are feeling

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.780

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 0>I mean, they're not associated with marks, but it's really,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.260
<v Speaker 0>really helpful way for me to kind of keep in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.010
<v Speaker 0>So you can see every week you have a mix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.810
<v Speaker 0>of let's say week three overview.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 0>So there's a mix between warm up core and optional.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.210
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.610
<v Speaker 0>So in week three for example there's three warm up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 0>So I would strongly recommend that every week you do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.730

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.370

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.130

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.450
<v Speaker 0>moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.290
<v Speaker 0>Try and do those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.650
<v Speaker 0>If you have time to do the optional great, that's

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.290
<v Speaker 0>But these warm up and core exercises should really be

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.210

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.330

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,66,65]}

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.730
<v Speaker 0>I would absolutely prioritise warm up and core lab exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.810

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.860

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100]}

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 0>So they start in week three and they finish in

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.060
<v Speaker 0>week ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, I think there's six tutorials that are kind of

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.540
<v Speaker 0>core material.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.860
<v Speaker 0>We also have tutorials that focus on assessment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.900

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.540
<v Speaker 0>But also the second assignment is in two parts.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 0>You do the first bit and then you get feedback.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.900

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Speaker 0>And then in a tutorial we'll go through that and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 0>then you improve it for resubmission.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.860
<v Speaker 0>So I'll talk about that in here at the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78,72,87,100,100]}

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 0>So we've got three pieces of coursework starting in week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.030
<v Speaker 0>So although it's 100% coursework, the final piece of assessment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.870
<v Speaker 0>And that is because we used to do it all

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.630
<v Speaker 0>We've dropped a little bit of the assessment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.310
<v Speaker 0>So the assignment three is now shorter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.830
<v Speaker 0>And that is because it was just too intense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.510
<v Speaker 0>We got a lot of feedback from students that there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 0>was just too much assessment during the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.390
<v Speaker 0>I think it's really important that it's not too overwhelming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 0>So we've dropped that a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.990
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully you'll find it a bit more manageable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.910
<v Speaker 0>And then we have the continuous assessment and the weekly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.870
<v Speaker 0>quizzes, which is worth up to 20%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 0>And the weekly quizzes are released on the Monday after

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.390
<v Speaker 0>the first lecture of the week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 0>So in week one, we released the week one quiz

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.590
<v Speaker 0>today, and then you have the whole of that week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.510
<v Speaker 0>and the next week to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 0>So a week one quiz is due lunchtime on Friday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.790
<v Speaker 0>in week two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 0>So for example, the week six quiz is released Monday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 0>week six and it's due Friday week seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I would definitely recommend doing it the week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78]}

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 0>After the lecture you'll remember it easier more easily.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.210
<v Speaker 0>But if for some reason you don't have time or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100]}

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.650
<v Speaker 0>They really should not be difficult or time consuming or

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.570

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, what did I say?

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.170
<v Speaker 0>Tending lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.010
<v Speaker 0>Really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.010
<v Speaker 0>Whether that's in person or online, in person, preferably attending

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.650
<v Speaker 0>tutorial, working on your lab exercises, reading set texts.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.690
<v Speaker 0>I put 1.5 hours.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.690
<v Speaker 0>Actually, I might change that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.610
<v Speaker 0>That seems way too much for reading set text because

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 0>as I said, reading is you need to know stuff,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.890
<v Speaker 0>and sometimes it's useful to read different explanations of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:25.850
<v Speaker 0>you've got in lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 0>But practice is a really important stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,72,72,72,100,100,100]}

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.690
<v Speaker 0>So have a look at those hours if you're doing

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.020
<v Speaker 0>something completely different to those hours, maybe think about whether

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.020

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.540
<v Speaker 0>So do not work really long hours.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.300
<v Speaker 0>Like some lecturers are really encouraging to work very long

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:38.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.140

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.580

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.260

<v Speaker 0>rest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.620
<v Speaker 0>It's really important that you get that balance right.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.740

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.620

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.860

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.420
<v Speaker 0>And it's okay.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.290
<v Speaker 0>So Java is an imperative language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 0>That means imperative is about you give something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.060
<v Speaker 0>A list of things to do, and it goes through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 0>the list and it does it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.820
<v Speaker 0>So a lot of things we do in everyday life

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.660
<v Speaker 0>are imperative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.620
<v Speaker 0>For example, cooking, cooking recipes are usually imperative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 0>They'll have a list of things to do and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.620
<v Speaker 0>go through in the right order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.300
<v Speaker 0>If you try and do things out of order, well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.220
<v Speaker 0>sometimes it's fine actually, but generally it's set up so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.340
<v Speaker 0>that you do things in the right order and that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.300
<v Speaker 0>can be quite important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 0>So see processing step by step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 0>Now in object oriented programming it's all based around objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 0>And objects live in classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.340
<v Speaker 0>So we're thinking when the the mindset of object oriented

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.980
<v Speaker 0>programming is thinking about what sort of things exist in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,98,100]}

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.580
<v Speaker 0>the world, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.620
<v Speaker 0>So that might be we might be talking about different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.460
<v Speaker 0>kinds of students.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.860
<v Speaker 0>We might be talking about physical things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.860
<v Speaker 0>These are objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.740
<v Speaker 0>And object oriented programming is all about how objects interact

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.380
<v Speaker 0>with one another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.180
<v Speaker 0>And objects are organised into classes and objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 0>Do what we carry states.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87]}

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.420
<v Speaker 0>That means they remember things about themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 0>So they Day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58]}

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.160
<v Speaker 0>So?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.120
<v Speaker 0>So they they know where you've got to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 0>If you're going through a recipe there will know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,88]}

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:25.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 0>Actually this is not a very clear explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240
<v Speaker 0>So an object knows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 0>For example, if an object is a car, it will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.600
<v Speaker 0>know its own speed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.160
<v Speaker 0>Or maybe it'll know whether its you know its own

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,88,100,100,61,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 0>colour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.520
<v Speaker 0>It will know the state that it's in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.480
<v Speaker 0>So objects are able to carry state.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.280
<v Speaker 0>So the idea is that the program is structured like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.600
<v Speaker 0>the real world into objects, which are organised into classes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.000
<v Speaker 0>of things that are the same kind of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.840
<v Speaker 0>So they store data about themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, they can they have behaviour, which means they can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,95,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.080
<v Speaker 0>do things in response to messages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 0>So you can send the message to an object and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 0>it'll carry out certain behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,100,100,100,99]}

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 0>They also have identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 0>That means that you can have two objects that have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.400
<v Speaker 0>exactly the same state, but they are different objects and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.080
<v Speaker 0>they can be treated differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.480
<v Speaker 0>Now, all of this might seem a little unclear if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 0>you don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 0>If you've never done this before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 0>But don't worry, this will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 0>We'll be going over this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 0>We'll be seeing lots of examples of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 0>This will become much more familiar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 0>So state behaviour and identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.450
<v Speaker 0>These are the three things about objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.890
<v Speaker 0>But they don't have to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 0>They might not have any state.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.530
<v Speaker 0>They might not have any behaviour that might be empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:32.930
<v Speaker 0>There might be nothing they can actually do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.210
<v Speaker 0>But these are all things you can associate with objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.290
<v Speaker 0>And objects are always oriented in classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:43.370
<v Speaker 0>So let's start off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to start off by okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.690
<v Speaker 0>So let me just talk about okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.930
<v Speaker 0>So right creating a new class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.050
<v Speaker 0>So in Java code sits inside a class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 0>So you'll be doing a lot of creating classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.690
<v Speaker 0>Classes have names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.330
<v Speaker 0>It's a convention that they use CamelCase.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 0>So they start with a capital letter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,99,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 0>And every new word has a capital letter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.890
<v Speaker 0>It's not it's not going to force you to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:08.010
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.690
<v Speaker 0>But you always should do it like that.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.250
<v Speaker 0>And it goes into its own file.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.850
<v Speaker 0>Usually as you get much more complex, you'll find that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,98]}

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:14.490
<v Speaker 0>not always true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.490
<v Speaker 0>But from the point of view of this class and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 0>of course, and mostly what you're doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.500
<v Speaker 0>Each class has a file of its own and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.620
<v Speaker 0>ends in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to start using Visual Studio Code instead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.620
<v Speaker 0>of um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70]}

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.420
<v Speaker 0>So mostly we're going to be using IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.500
<v Speaker 0>If you've done the Getting Started materials then you will

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 0>be familiar with IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.940
<v Speaker 0>Um let's do so I'm going to do a new

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.380
<v Speaker 0>file.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.940
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to call it Hello world.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.460
<v Speaker 0>So you see I'm using CamelCase here with my capital

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 0>H and my capital W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.020
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to call it Java okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to put that in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's just I'll just save it in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,99,80,100,95,95,100,100]}

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.340
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.740
<v Speaker 0>I've got to start off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to start off this is, this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.180
<v Speaker 0>the class file.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.820
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to call it a class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Speaker 0>And the name of the class is hello world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.740
<v Speaker 0>And it should be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 0>Generally the convention is that the name of the class

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.780
<v Speaker 0>is going to be the same as the name of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.740
<v Speaker 0>the file you've stored it in, and I have my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.840
<v Speaker 0>curly braces now Also, when I declare a class, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.800
<v Speaker 0>have to say how accessible it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.960
<v Speaker 0>So for now, I'm going to put public.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 0>We'll look at what that means later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.200
<v Speaker 0>Now all classes have to have a main message main

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.720
<v Speaker 0>method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 0>So you usually always start off defining a class by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 0>defining the main method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 0>So you have to call it main.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 0>And then main methods always take in an array of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.440
<v Speaker 0>strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.040
<v Speaker 0>That's called args.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.240
<v Speaker 0>So this is what's coming into the method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.040
<v Speaker 0>And again there's certain things we have to declare about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 0>a method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.880
<v Speaker 0>And don't worry about the details.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 0>We'll get on to this later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,91,100,100]}

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.840
<v Speaker 0>But I'm going to say this is public.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840
<v Speaker 0>Anyone can see it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:51.920
<v Speaker 0>It's static.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk about what that means later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.960
<v Speaker 0>And then I have to say what sort of thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.000
<v Speaker 0>is this method going to return?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.040
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do with Hello World is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.240
<v Speaker 0>I just want to print out a statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.200
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to return anything to the program.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.720
<v Speaker 0>I just want to print it out and stop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.560
<v Speaker 0>So I don't want anything to be returned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.040
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to put void in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.720
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to open my curly braces and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 0>print.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.000
<v Speaker 0>And in Java printing is System.out.println.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.690
<v Speaker 0>Learn and it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,97,86]}

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to put a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.170
<v Speaker 0>So in Java you always put strings and double braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:20.690
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.530
<v Speaker 0>Not double braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.450
<v Speaker 0>Double quotation marks I'm going to say hello world okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.290
<v Speaker 0>And statements in Java always end in a semicolon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.770
<v Speaker 0>So unless I've got a typo in that, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.810
<v Speaker 0>very common when I'm doing when you're doing live coding,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.850
<v Speaker 0>it's almost impossible not to get loads of typos.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:37.570
<v Speaker 0>So let me see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.410
<v Speaker 0>It's a hello world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,97,100,100]}

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so you can see here I've got this hello

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 0>world Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.810
<v Speaker 0>So Java is a compiled language right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.930
<v Speaker 0>So how many people put your hands up if you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.250
<v Speaker 0>familiar with what it means to be a compiled language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.570
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.450
<v Speaker 0>So lots of people but a lot of people aren't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.850
<v Speaker 0>So what this means is it takes something that's more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 0>or less machine readable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 0>So you can see what I've written here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.170
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, more or less human readable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.010
<v Speaker 0>This is written in in stuff that's very accessible to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.050
<v Speaker 0>humans, and it turns it into something that's machine readable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:05.970
<v Speaker 0>That's the first step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.490
<v Speaker 0>It will first compile it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.170
<v Speaker 0>And then once you have the compiled code, you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:10.690
<v Speaker 0>run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.900
<v Speaker 0>So to compile it I need to say it's Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.740
<v Speaker 0>C is a command and I put hello world Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,97,100,100,100,98,49,49,97]}

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what's it saying?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.380
<v Speaker 0>Can't find some stupid typo.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:25.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody debug this for me?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.180
<v Speaker 0>What have I done?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.820
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what I've done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.260
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.580
<v Speaker 0>It's not strings, it's string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.420
<v Speaker 0>Thank you very much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.900
<v Speaker 0>Is that going to help?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98,100]}

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay, great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.580
<v Speaker 0>So we do a lot of live debugging because it's

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.340
<v Speaker 0>really it's just even typing your name when loads of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 0>people are watching you is really difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 0>And however many times I practice I'm always like, okay,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90,100,100,88,73,94,95,100,100]}

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.620
<v Speaker 0>so we've compiled it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.420
<v Speaker 0>Now if we see what we've got, we've got this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 0>hello world class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.500
<v Speaker 0>And we've also got Hello World Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.100
<v Speaker 0>So I wrote the Hello World Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.700
<v Speaker 0>Hello world class has appeared when I compiled it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.740
<v Speaker 0>So if we look at Hello World Java okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.260
<v Speaker 0>That's just what we, what we typed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 0>I don't know if you can even see this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.580
<v Speaker 0>This is maybe too small, but if we look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.100
<v Speaker 0>what's in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.480
<v Speaker 0>Hello world class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.760
<v Speaker 0>This is a binary file.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 0>So if we look at that you can see that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.200
<v Speaker 0>unintelligible to to a human that is machine readable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 0>So now we can just run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.560
<v Speaker 0>We just use Java and then the name of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.080
<v Speaker 0>class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.360
<v Speaker 0>And now it's done the printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 0>So it's actually run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.880
<v Speaker 0>So this is maybe so you don't need to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 0>about this very much because we're using Ides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.520
<v Speaker 0>But I think it's really important just to begin with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.760
<v Speaker 0>to, to show you what that means to be a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.440
<v Speaker 0>compiled language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.440
<v Speaker 0>We'll talk later on about pros and cons of why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.120
<v Speaker 0>you might want to use a compiled language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, but that is what it means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 0>It's this two step process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.760
<v Speaker 0>However, mostly what we're going to do is use IntelliJ,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.760
<v Speaker 0>and IntelliJ does a lot of stuff for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 0>And that means that although it's still a compiled language

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.240
<v Speaker 0>and these two steps are still happening, you're not aware

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 0>of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.520
<v Speaker 0>You just press run and it'll do that for you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.320
<v Speaker 0>without you having to be involved in that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.130
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to start a new project and I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.810
<v Speaker 0>to do the Hello World project in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,81,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.890
<v Speaker 0>So again I'm going to create this file called Hello

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:20.450
<v Speaker 0>World.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:23.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.090
<v Speaker 0>Um now let me make this bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:32.530
<v Speaker 0>So often it's kind of, um, quite I don't always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 0>think as much as I should do about how visible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 0>things are to you and stuff, so if it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.730
<v Speaker 0>visible, please just shout out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:39.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.330
<v Speaker 0>How do I make this bigger?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:41.450
<v Speaker 0>Actually, I should know this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100]}

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 0>It's not okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,76]}

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to get the main screen and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,100,100,100,100,94,94]}

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 0>see if I can make that bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.370
<v Speaker 0>So to make a new class, this is slightly unintuitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 0>actually, even though Java is largely very intuitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Speaker 0>I mean, IntelliJ is largely very intuitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.330
<v Speaker 0>You have to go to source and then you right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 0>click.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 0>And you choose New Java class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.890
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to call this Hello World again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.050
<v Speaker 0>And it automatically creates this class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:06.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.770
<v Speaker 0>So let me see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:09.290
<v Speaker 0>Is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 0>Why is it not getting bigger?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.660
<v Speaker 0>Can you see that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I might practice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 0>I don't really know why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:19.220
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.180
<v Speaker 0>It's not responding to the Apple Plus, but I will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,67,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 0>practice making that bigger in case it's not clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so it's already filled this with it knows it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:27.580
<v Speaker 0>a class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.660
<v Speaker 0>It's making it public.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.580
<v Speaker 0>And now I need to add the main method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.020
<v Speaker 0>So I just have to put mine in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 0>And as if by magic, all of that stuff I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.860
<v Speaker 0>talked about automatically appears.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to do the printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 0>Hello world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 0>Already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 0>The semicolon is there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100]}

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.700
<v Speaker 0>So it already gives me all this stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.060
<v Speaker 0>So to run it I just press the green arrow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.820
<v Speaker 0>and I can either run the whole class, the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.900
<v Speaker 0>the whole class, or I can run just the method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.900
<v Speaker 0>In this case, it doesn't make any difference because there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 0>only is one method, but later on you'll be doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.300
<v Speaker 0>classes with more than one method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to run that okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:05.980
<v Speaker 0>And then what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.300
<v Speaker 0>The output appears down here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 0>So you can see this is what it's actually doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 0>And as you can see, the compilation and the running

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 0>happened at the same time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.120
<v Speaker 0>You don't notice that happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.160
<v Speaker 0>So that is how you do that in IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.040
<v Speaker 0>So let's go back to the slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 0>So we've had a look at what this means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 0>And we've had so generally I do a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.600
<v Speaker 0>things using live coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.960
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just going to flick through the slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.960
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to say everything I've just said as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 0>I'm coding, but it's in the slides so that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.000
<v Speaker 0>can if you want to go back and refer to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 0>it in the slides, it's all there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.920
<v Speaker 0>But if you just prefer to watch the video, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.240
<v Speaker 0>don't have to see me going through everything twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.640
<v Speaker 0>So everything I should have already said here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100]}

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.880
<v Speaker 0>So the edit compile run cycle, which again, if you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 0>using an IDE, it's really just an edit run cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 0>But the point is so you you create your program,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,99]}

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.170
<v Speaker 0>or you change your program and then you compile it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:11.810
<v Speaker 0>and then you run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Speaker 0>But the kind of the point I'm trying to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.690
<v Speaker 0>here is that this is a cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.730
<v Speaker 0>And this should be happening really, really frequently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:22.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, the golden rules of programming are save regularly, run

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.050
<v Speaker 0>it often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:23.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.370
<v Speaker 0>Because if you make 1 or 2 changes and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.650
<v Speaker 0>you run it and it breaks, it's not very difficult

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.450
<v Speaker 0>to figure out what went wrong because there's only 1

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.650
<v Speaker 0>or 2 things it could be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 0>If you've been coding for half an hour or an

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 0>hour and you run it and it doesn't run, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.170
<v Speaker 0>a nightmare because there's so many different things it could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.330
<v Speaker 0>be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.690
<v Speaker 0>And that could put I mean, it's just it's just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.210
<v Speaker 0>a nightmare.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 0>So the more often you run it, the more sure

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.850
<v Speaker 0>you are of where things are going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.010
<v Speaker 0>And we'll talk about these different kinds of correctness later

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:50.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.730
<v Speaker 0>So let's have some basic functionality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 0>Let's do some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.850
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to keep this in the hello world class,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,76,100]}

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.810
<v Speaker 0>which is not very good practice because the class should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 0>always do something relating to its name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.330
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm going to be doing some arithmetic, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 0>I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:04.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:10.700
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to print out, The sum of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100]}

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:10.940
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.940
<v Speaker 0>Give me an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.020
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:18.860
<v Speaker 0>Another integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.100
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:21.900
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.860
<v Speaker 0>So I'm printing out a string there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.420
<v Speaker 0>You can tell it's a string because it's in double

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:27.180
<v Speaker 0>quotation marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.380
<v Speaker 0>This means that Java is not going to evaluate that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.660
<v Speaker 0>It's just prints as is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm going to get Java to do a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 0>bit more work on the printing out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to put three plus two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 0>So slightly annoyingly IntelliJ always comes up with these these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 0>pop up things which can be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.940
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes they just get in the way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.860
<v Speaker 0>So what's going to happen when I run this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 0>So it prints out the string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.940
<v Speaker 0>And then with this this is not a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.780
<v Speaker 0>So it's looking at what's going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.420
<v Speaker 0>It can tell that these are numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 0>It knows what plus means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.580
<v Speaker 0>So it's doing the work here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 0>It's doing the evaluation and then it's printing it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 0>And actually so I can get rid of the LN

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 0>means add a new line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 0>So usually we use println because you always want a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 0>new line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.920
<v Speaker 0>But here we don't want a new line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:14.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's doing the sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,65]}

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, and let me just show you the quotient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.440
<v Speaker 0>So three divided by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 0>What do people think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.680
<v Speaker 0>The answer of this is going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.810
<v Speaker 0>Any idea what this is going to be 3 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:30.800
<v Speaker 0>3 divided by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 0>Anyone know?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.200
<v Speaker 0>One.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 0>The answer is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:39.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.840
<v Speaker 0>So if you're not familiar with what we're doing, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.160
<v Speaker 0>might seem a little bit weird.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.400
<v Speaker 0>From a math point of view, the answer is obviously

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.200
<v Speaker 0>1.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.240
<v Speaker 0>But if we run that, we're going to see the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.000
<v Speaker 0>answer is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.800
<v Speaker 0>So why is that happening?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.480
<v Speaker 0>Now this is to do with types.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.440
<v Speaker 0>Typing in Java is really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.200
<v Speaker 0>Three is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.320
<v Speaker 0>Two is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 0>So when Java is interpreting what it actually should do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 0>with this, the the class of the arguments of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.690
<v Speaker 0>function are important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.930
<v Speaker 0>So it's interpreting this as integer division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 0>So if you just put integers in this means it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 0>an integer operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.490
<v Speaker 0>It will only return integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.890
<v Speaker 0>So it works out it's 1.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100]}

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:18.330
<v Speaker 0>It'll return that as an integer and it always rounds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:18.530
<v Speaker 0>down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 0>So the answer it returns is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at different things we can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.810
<v Speaker 0>with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.770
<v Speaker 0>So the name is bond.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.410
