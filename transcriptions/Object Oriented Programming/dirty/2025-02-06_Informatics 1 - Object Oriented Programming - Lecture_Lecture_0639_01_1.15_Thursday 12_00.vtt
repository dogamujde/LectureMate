NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.920
<v Speaker 0>I can't make it go much more slowly because we've

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.160
<v Speaker 0>quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 0>BA ba ba ba.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99,99,99]}

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 0>What was the other thing I wanted to pick up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,91,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.560
<v Speaker 0>on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so somebody made the point that the stuff in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 0>the lectures is quite easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 0>And when you go on to tutorials and labs and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.840
<v Speaker 0>assessment, it's much harder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.280
<v Speaker 0>So there's a bit of a disconnect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, so to some extent this is intentional.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.760

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 0>So the the lectures are about getting the basic materials

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.290
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.210
<v Speaker 0>So you know, the stuff, the tutorials about putting that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,85,98,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 0>into practice, that does sometimes mean doing harder things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 0>And that's what the tutors are there for to provide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 0>that structure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 0>And it's the same with the labs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 0>The demonstrators are there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 0>The lab sessions are not well used.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 0>So if you find the labs, it's a bit harder

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.290

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.570
<v Speaker 0>Yes, it is, because it's putting into practice what we've

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.890

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 0>If you're not clear on that, go to the lectures.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.209
<v Speaker 0>The assessment again, this is a balance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 0>It's pushing a little bit further than we've done in

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 0>the lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 0>But it shouldn't be really overwhelming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 0>We I think assignment the first assignment does contain material

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.130

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.060
<v Speaker 0>We are doing the Java API this week, so this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 0>is stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 0>We've a little bit touched on this before, and this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 0>is about some of the functionality of how we do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 0>things in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Speaker 0>But this also carries over to a lot of other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.660
<v Speaker 0>programming languages okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 0>So built in classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.700
<v Speaker 0>So we've already used built in classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.580
<v Speaker 0>We talked a little bit last week about built in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 0>classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.340
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.700
<v Speaker 0>And this is the Java API is the class library

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 0>of all the things that are built into Java and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 0>that you can use without having to worry about how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 0>they're implemented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 0>So again, we saw a diagram like this a couple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 0>of weeks ago or last week or something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 0>I don't know about how you interact with the implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 0>So the point of the API here is to protect

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 0>the user from the implementation, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 0>So when we're doing like print print stuff, whatever, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 0>don't care how that's implemented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to go into the code to see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.460
<v Speaker 0>how it's printed out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Speaker 0>I just want to know this is the thing I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 0>can use that's going to do the thing that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.460
<v Speaker 0>want, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.590
<v Speaker 0>So the API is what allows me to me to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.670
<v Speaker 0>interact with the implementation without actually having to care about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.030
<v Speaker 0>what's in the implementation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 0>So this just makes it way easier for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.630
<v Speaker 0>But also it means that the underlying implementation can be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.670
<v Speaker 0>changed without affecting the user.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.470
<v Speaker 0>So all you need to keep the same, you need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.550
<v Speaker 0>to keep the basic functionality, what it's doing the same,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 0>and the inputs and outputs are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,90,100]}

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.630
<v Speaker 0>If you're changing those, then you're going to be screwing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 0>up things for users.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.670
<v Speaker 0>But if you keep those the same and you change

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 0>how it's implemented, then that's not the concern of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 0>user, which makes life way, way easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.030
<v Speaker 0>So some of the things that we've looked at already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 0>So print um, strings generating random numbers, all of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.870
<v Speaker 0>Now clearly we don't want every user to just be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.470
<v Speaker 0>figuring all this out from, from, um, from basics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,65,100,100]}

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.910
<v Speaker 0>We we want this built in so that because people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 0>are doing it all the time, it's a total waste

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.870
<v Speaker 0>of time to get every user to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 0>And generally, people want to do this in exactly the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.910
<v Speaker 0>same way as all the other users.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 0>All the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800
<v Speaker 0>All the all the things that you're coding yourself are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.600
<v Speaker 0>things that you're particularly coding for, the things that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 0>want to achieve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 0>And you might be conceiving this in different ways to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.520
<v Speaker 0>other people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 0>You might be doing different things with them so they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.160
<v Speaker 0>wouldn't be in the library.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 0>But the things that are just general people are going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 0>to want to do the same things with them, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 0>they're going to want to do it a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.440
<v Speaker 0>This is the kind of thing you get in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.920
<v Speaker 0>library.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so packages we haven't talked about packages, I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 0>think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 0>But packages are how you organise classes together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.120
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.920
<v Speaker 0>So we've talked quite a lot about what you want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.120
<v Speaker 0>to change together stays together or code where the logic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 0>is um, whether logically similar or they belong together, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.040
<v Speaker 0>keep the code in the same place and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 0>what classes are for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 0>But then classes also work together and you can put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.120
<v Speaker 0>these in packages, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 0>The code that needs to be chained together live together

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100,91,100]}

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.120
<v Speaker 0>classes are not enough because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Speaker 0>Because you might want to change classes together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 0>Oh, this is quite out of date, sorry I did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.040
<v Speaker 0>I did mean to update this, but in the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.560
<v Speaker 0>I thought, I mean it's just it's just illustrative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 0>Illustrative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 0>Illustrative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.700
<v Speaker 0>How do I say that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.580
<v Speaker 0>Illustrative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.460
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, um, I didn't update it because it's the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.700
<v Speaker 0>point, but this is basically showing you that there's tons

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 0>and tons of classes in the library.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 0>It actually got a little bit less between 10 and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 0>11 because I did a bit of organisation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.300
<v Speaker 0>So sometimes periodically things go through, people go go through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,74,100,100]}

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.660
<v Speaker 0>And some of the old classes aren't used, but generally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 0>there's a lot of stuff you can use and it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.060
<v Speaker 0>growing over time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 0>So you don't just want thousands and thousands of classes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:15.740
<v Speaker 0>all over the place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 0>You want to organise them into packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.620
<v Speaker 0>So think of packages as subfolders.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, and within those are the classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.900
<v Speaker 0>So for example we've got the Java.lang package that has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.300
<v Speaker 0>various classes for using things like integers or integer maths

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,90]}

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.900
<v Speaker 0>and strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 0>So remember um, string is not a primitive, but it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 0>is something that you can just use without doing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.140
<v Speaker 0>coding yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.820
<v Speaker 0>That's because it's in java.lang.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.430
<v Speaker 0>Uh, Java util has got res and date arrays and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 0>dates and scanners and various other things, utility things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.990
<v Speaker 0>So you think these are all utility things?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 0>These are all things to do with language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.910
<v Speaker 0>Put them in a package that's relevant okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 0>And you can see the naming convention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.990
<v Speaker 0>We've seen this dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 0>This dot does a lot of heavy lifting in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.270
<v Speaker 0>We use it for a lot of things here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.230
<v Speaker 0>We're using it um to indicate that this is what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 0>the package name is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.750
<v Speaker 0>The package name is util or the package name is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 0>lang.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.630
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at this okay I'll just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,65,71]}

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.470
<v Speaker 0>get my notes out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,88,100,100]}

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.870
<v Speaker 0>Remind me what it is that I want to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.870
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.750
<v Speaker 0>So let's go to IntelliJ and have a look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.110
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.430
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to I'm going to actually actually I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.750
<v Speaker 0>going to bring up calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 0>First of all just to show you an example of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.270
<v Speaker 0>something we've looked at before okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.070
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to get rid of this okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 0>So I've changed it to dark I think that's what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,78,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 0>people indicate a preference for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 0>But if um if you don't like the dark just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 0>let me know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.640
<v Speaker 0>Is that okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.240
<v Speaker 0>Can you see that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.680
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,95]}

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.040
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 0>So here we're using this built in method to string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,46,100]}

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:52.960
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.680
<v Speaker 0>So at the moment it's complaining that it doesn't know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 0>what two string is okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,95]}

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.640
<v Speaker 0>And this is because two string is in a package

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.560
<v Speaker 0>and I haven't I haven't imported that package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 0>So if you're using a built in package you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 0>to import it so that um, so that the code

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.800
<v Speaker 0>can access it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.400
<v Speaker 0>It's not automatically accessing everything in the library.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's only accessing the things you're telling it to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.640
<v Speaker 0>import that keeps it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.760
<v Speaker 0>It helps with memory and it's more organised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.920
<v Speaker 0>So I have to tell it where to look for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.920
<v Speaker 0>And this is in the class arrays okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.440
<v Speaker 0>So here first of all it's like I don't know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 0>what two string is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.200
<v Speaker 0>But now it's like okay you've told me where two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.320
<v Speaker 0>string is, but I don't know what arrays are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 0>And that's because I haven't imported, um, the util, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.840
<v Speaker 0>is the package in which arrays can be found.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.080
<v Speaker 0>Now because intelligence is very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,36,99,100,100]}

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.640
<v Speaker 0>I don't have to do this myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.100
<v Speaker 0>I can ask it to do it for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 0>So here where it says cannot resolve symbol arrays, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,51,75,100]}

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.180
<v Speaker 0>gives me the option to import class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 0>So if I import it, it just it knows where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 0>this is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.940
<v Speaker 0>It's in the utils class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.700
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not importing all of util.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.140
<v Speaker 0>I'm just importing class arrays which is in the package

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 0>util and now is happy with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,30,100,100,100]}

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.900
<v Speaker 0>It's not happy here because I still haven't told it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.300
<v Speaker 0>where to look for it, but now I'm telling it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50]}

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, this this is in the class arrays and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.460
<v Speaker 0>knows where that is because I've imported the package in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.540
<v Speaker 0>which it can be found.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 0>Oh, interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 0>Fruit is the clear winner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.020
<v Speaker 0>I'm bringing too many biscuits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.700
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I'll bring some grapes this time then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so now we'll look at the date printer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.140
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to start a new project here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 0>I haven't actually done that for a while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I'm going to call it Date Printer five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.620
<v Speaker 0>And here I'm going to create a new Java class,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Speaker 0>Us, which is also going to be called deep into

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.030
<v Speaker 0>five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.310
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,93]}

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.110
<v Speaker 0>Not sure why I was doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,99,44,79,79,100,100]}

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:52.830
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do here, I just simply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.230
<v Speaker 0>want to find out what the day to day is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.550
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to do that by creating a new

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.430
<v Speaker 0>instance of date.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 0>What data date and doesn't like this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.550
<v Speaker 0>Because I haven't told it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76]}

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 0>The class and the class is date.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.030
<v Speaker 0>So I want to create a new instance of something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:14.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, there's of type date and I'm not giving it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,38]}

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.270
<v Speaker 0>so data something that doesn't need any arguments because what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,44,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.910
<v Speaker 0>it does is it just fetches whatever the current date

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.589
<v Speaker 0>and time is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to print that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.470
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.550
<v Speaker 0>It's not going to complete it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 0>Let me so it doesn't it's not going to let

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 0>you complete things you don't that you can't do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,58]}

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 0>So it's upset about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.470
<v Speaker 0>And why is it upset about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.070
<v Speaker 0>It's upset about this because I haven't told it where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't know I'm using a method doesn't know where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.470
<v Speaker 0>it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 0>So if this is a message, I'm sorry, a method

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.440
<v Speaker 0>I'm defining myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 0>I then need to do what we've seen before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.640
<v Speaker 0>Also, sorry I haven't put a main method in which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.600
<v Speaker 0>is a bit of a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now actually might might allow me to print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,36,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.280
<v Speaker 0>stuff out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,86]}

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 0>So I have to tell it what it needs to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 0>know what date is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100]}

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 0>This is not something I'm defining myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 0>I don't have to create this method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 0>I have to tell it where to find it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.680
<v Speaker 0>So there's two ways I can do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.000
<v Speaker 0>I can just say, right, this is in Java util.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 0>So I can just do Java util date there and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.520
<v Speaker 0>over here okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85]}

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 0>And this can be a useful way to do it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.680
<v Speaker 0>if you're only referring it to a once.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 0>But it gets a little bit unwieldy because every time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 0>you want to use anything in here, you have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080
<v Speaker 0>type it out and fill.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 0>So what I can do instead is I can just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.800
<v Speaker 0>use the import statement and then I don't need these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.160
<v Speaker 0>And again IntelliJ can help me with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.840
<v Speaker 0>And it's asking me do I want to import the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 0>class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.540
<v Speaker 0>Again there's two different kinds of dates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.020
<v Speaker 0>There's one in util and the one in SQL package,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,81,100,100,99,100]}

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Speaker 0>and I want to import the one that's in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.620
<v Speaker 0>util package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.220
<v Speaker 0>So it will then here import this this class for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 0>me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.620
<v Speaker 0>And then the package the class within the package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.500
<v Speaker 0>And then if I run that it's going to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is what it inputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.780
<v Speaker 0>This is what outputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 0>It tells me that this is the date.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 0>Thursday February the 6th.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,82,82]}

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.460
<v Speaker 0>Then this is the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Speaker 0>And that's just the format that it automatically does it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.420
<v Speaker 0>in date, although there's ways to change that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.540
<v Speaker 0>So and this is exactly what I was saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 0>You're creating this new instance of date and you're telling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.500
<v Speaker 0>it the package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.580
<v Speaker 0>But the easier way is to import the package before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.180
<v Speaker 0>you start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 0>You can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.620
<v Speaker 0>So you can see here it's importing the specific class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.740
<v Speaker 0>You can use the star to import everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 0>It's not considered best practice because um, then you're just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.620
<v Speaker 0>importing a ton of stuff you don't use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.100
<v Speaker 0>It's better just to import the stuff that you do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.150
<v Speaker 0>use, but it's workable and you can do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that reminds me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 0>I didn't answer the questions from last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.870
<v Speaker 0>There was something similar to that in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,63,88,100,99,99,97,100]}

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 0>I must remember to do that before the end of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.510
<v Speaker 0>the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 0>The questions that came up in woohoo clap last time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,56,56,100,100]}

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.430
<v Speaker 0>And here we've got another example of static inputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.950
<v Speaker 0>So static inputs allow you to skip class identifiers for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.270
<v Speaker 0>calling class methods or using static constants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.390
<v Speaker 0>So here we've got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:07.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 0>So we're creating we're importing the calendar package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.070
<v Speaker 0>And we're saying here that within that we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 0>find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.430
<v Speaker 0>So there's a static constant inside calendar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 0>And year is um something that you'll find is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,98,100,78,100]}

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.870
<v Speaker 0>constant that you're going to find in calendar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, and here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 0>So the point here is that you have to every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 0>time you're doing this, you have to put this dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.350
<v Speaker 0>calendar and to say that this is where the static

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.190
<v Speaker 0>constant will be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, but here we can import static.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.280
<v Speaker 0>And that's going to we're importing all of the static

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.480
<v Speaker 0>constants in calendar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 0>And now when we look at getting the year, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 0>month and the day of the month, we don't have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.280
<v Speaker 0>to put dot calendar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,44,100]}

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 0>So here what we're doing here is we're importing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 0>class with the methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.280
<v Speaker 0>And here we're importing the static constants okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 0>So we will um we'll look at more examples of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.040
<v Speaker 0>that later if that's not completely clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:03.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 0>So as you've seen we're using string and math a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.200
<v Speaker 0>lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.680
<v Speaker 0>But we never but we don't have to import anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 0>Why is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to import java.lang.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, we've used if you look back at some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.120
<v Speaker 0>the coding that's using strings and stuff, we haven't imported

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.640
<v Speaker 0>anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.840
<v Speaker 0>Java.lang is just imported invisibly all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 0>It can always access anything in Java.lang without importing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.480
<v Speaker 0>So that's why you don't need import statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we can create our own package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.820
<v Speaker 0>So say we are creating a data app and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.260
<v Speaker 0>want to put different classes in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:47.220
<v Speaker 0>So one of these, this class here, um, that uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,47]}

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.380
<v Speaker 0>so date printer, this is something that we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 0>want to put into a package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.340
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.660
<v Speaker 0>So here you can see there's just, just a class

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 0>on its own.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 0>But we want to make a package and we'll put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.340
<v Speaker 0>other things around the data now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,61]}

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.900
<v Speaker 0>So this is just one of the classes that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 0>want to have in our thing in our little date

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:02.660
<v Speaker 0>app.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to create a package or I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.540
<v Speaker 0>to set a tell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,95,96]}

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.060
<v Speaker 0>Um I'm going to tell Java that this is part

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.540
<v Speaker 0>of a package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.740
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to call it this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.740
<v Speaker 0>Dot out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,55]}

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.260
<v Speaker 0>This is the output okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100]}

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:16.980
<v Speaker 0>Is in this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.580
<v Speaker 0>So Java is not happy about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,39]}

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.780
<v Speaker 0>IntelliJ is not happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's see why it isn't happy because um, I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.100
<v Speaker 0>told it that Date Printer five is in this data

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.060
<v Speaker 0>package, but it's like, well, it's not this is this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 0>is the structure, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.180
<v Speaker 0>It isn't in a package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.350
<v Speaker 0>So I'm telling you what I'm telling it is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.710
<v Speaker 0>true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.950
<v Speaker 0>But because IntelliJ is very useful, it will it will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 0>do this for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.150
<v Speaker 0>So it says, do you want me to move this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.030
<v Speaker 0>to the right package?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.430
<v Speaker 0>If I can get the mouse to work properly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 0>So I can just click this and it's going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.230
<v Speaker 0>do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 0>And now sorry I didn't actually that was really unclear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 0>I should have I should have clicked on source.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 0>That was super unhelpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, because I wasn't actually showing you this at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.230
<v Speaker 0>So Date Printer five is now a class within this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.990
<v Speaker 0>package, and this has just appeared as you couldn't see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.710
<v Speaker 0>because I hadn't got that expanded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,89,100]}

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.390
<v Speaker 0>But if I'd have shown you this before I did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.990
<v Speaker 0>that import, um, this line here would not have existed,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.190
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.350
<v Speaker 0>This is something that's just the structure has been changed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.150
<v Speaker 0>by IntelliJ because I'm here explicitly changing the structure by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 0>saying, actually, I want to put this into a package

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.430
<v Speaker 0>or a subfolder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 0>That's all about things for dates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 0>So I'm putting these things together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.510
<v Speaker 0>Well, I say these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.570
<v Speaker 0>There's only one class there at the moment, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.090
<v Speaker 0>would do that if you wanted to create a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 0>of other classes related to them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so here you can see under source in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.130
<v Speaker 0>example we've got various packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 0>We've got an error package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 0>Uh so yeah we've got an error package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 0>We've got exec.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.810
<v Speaker 0>We've got other classes that are not packaged.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 0>So the structure of this of packages can get quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 0>complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.850
<v Speaker 0>And depending I mean as with everything, don't overcomplicate things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 0>because it gets harder to maintain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 0>But in some situations you might want quite a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 0>of different packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 0>You might even want layers and packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 0>So, um, yeah, you, uh, you can do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 0>So packages maintain their own isolated namespaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.890
<v Speaker 0>So, um, normally start with calm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 0>We've seen a bit why this is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,80,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.850
<v Speaker 0>This is because of how it relates to HTTP.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, but classes with the same name can coexist in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.290
<v Speaker 0>the same program if they're in different packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 0>So that can be quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 0>You can call things the things the same name if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.900
<v Speaker 0>you put them in different packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 0>So here we've got utils, we've got two different utils

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.660
<v Speaker 0>and one is utils for graphics and one is utils

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.380
<v Speaker 0>for io.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 0>So that could be useful with basic package names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.660
<v Speaker 0>So we can go to the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.820
<v Speaker 0>So being aware of Java um the Java API API

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 0>documentation is a really important part of being a coder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.220
<v Speaker 0>So I actually just noticed that this was really out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.780
<v Speaker 0>of date in the slides I originally had up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.620
<v Speaker 0>I've updated this to the most recent one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you downloaded the slides before about an hour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.740
<v Speaker 0>ago, this will link to the out-of-date one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,98]}

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.860
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't actually make really any difference for what I'm trying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 0>to show you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so if you go to Java API, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.740
<v Speaker 0>is what it looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.340
<v Speaker 0>So these are all the things that are built in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a little look at for example string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 0>because strings something we've done stuff about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,37,78]}

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.780
<v Speaker 0>So it's saying write string is a class within the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,98,73,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 0>lang package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.750
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at the documentation in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.590
<v Speaker 0>So class string is defining what a class string is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.630
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of documentation here that you can read

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 0>about explains what strings are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.550
<v Speaker 0>And then here you get the different constructors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.990
<v Speaker 0>So we have only ever looked at one way of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 0>constructing a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.070
<v Speaker 0>And that is just this string with no arguments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.950
<v Speaker 0>We're just saying this thing is a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 0>There is actually lots of different ways you can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.990
<v Speaker 0>this with bytes and all sorts of things, which we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 0>may look at later on, but we won't look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.830
<v Speaker 0>anything from B in in from B just this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,85,66,52,73,73,74,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.110
<v Speaker 0>the only constructor we're looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.670
<v Speaker 0>But the point is classes can have lots of different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.510
<v Speaker 0>constructors depending on what you actually want to do with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.470
<v Speaker 0>objects in that class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 0>You'll also see this deprecated stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is old methods that did exist and are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.310
<v Speaker 0>not being used anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.470
<v Speaker 0>They keep them in the documentation so that you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.390
<v Speaker 0>see why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.870
<v Speaker 0>Perhaps legacy code isn't working because they say, oh well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.990
<v Speaker 0>that was using this and now it's been deprecated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 0>So these are all the methods um, and you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.610
<v Speaker 0>look at different, you can look at different categories and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.610
<v Speaker 0>they'll have all the deprecated methods in there, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.450
<v Speaker 0>useful if you're trying to find where something doesn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, some of these you're familiar with what we've looked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.090
<v Speaker 0>at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.930
<v Speaker 0>So equals equals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.890
<v Speaker 0>So this is saying equals is something that takes in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.610
<v Speaker 0>an object and it returns a boolean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, and what it's actually doing is it's comparing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 0>string to the specified object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86]}

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 0>So whatever object you pass on pass in does it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,62]}

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.690
<v Speaker 0>Is it the same as the string we've seen that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 0>we've seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.130
<v Speaker 0>Let's me see we've seen length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 0>Um so length doesn't take in any arguments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.850
<v Speaker 0>You just apply it to a string and it returns

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.090
<v Speaker 0>an integer which is the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.370
<v Speaker 0>So some of you may have come across things like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 0>char at I think some of you were using that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.850
<v Speaker 0>in tutorials, which returns the index at a character at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,97,100,100]}

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.970
<v Speaker 0>a particular values at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,92]}

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.930
<v Speaker 0>So there's loads and loads of these compared to concat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100]}

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.810
<v Speaker 0>These are all like most of these are useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Some of these you'll use a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 0>So if you're trying to do things with strings, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,97,97,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 0>first thing you do is go to the API and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.690
<v Speaker 0>see what built and stuff it has that you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 0>already use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.500
<v Speaker 0>So let's try using some of those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.260
<v Speaker 0>Let's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.180
<v Speaker 0>Have a look at string test one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.740
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do a little bit of coding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 0>about to determine whether a string is a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 0>So who knows what a palindrome is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.980
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone want to explain for people who don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay I'll explain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 0>So a palindrome is just something that reads the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 0>forwards or backwards, whether you start at the beginning of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 0>the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.620
<v Speaker 0>So for example, simply the name Anna is a palindrome

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 0>because whichever way you read it, it's the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100]}

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.300
<v Speaker 0>You can have or it could be they're either got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.500
<v Speaker 0>They are either the same up into the middle, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:25.380
<v Speaker 0>they've got a middle, uh, a middle character that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't matter how long it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 0>Is what I'm saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.700
<v Speaker 0>This is also a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 0>You can have much longer things a man.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 0>A plan, a canal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.470
<v Speaker 0>Panama.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.670
<v Speaker 0>That's quite pertinent at the moment with all the stuff

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 0>about Panama.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 0>So if you look at the letters, you can see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.430
<v Speaker 0>that they, um, they're all the same either way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 0>And they end in this middle letter C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.870
<v Speaker 0>So that is what a palindrome is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.750
<v Speaker 0>So what we're going to do is we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.990

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 0>test whether we're passing in a string.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to return a boolean value as to

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 0>whether or not it's a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.030
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do is I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 0>find out how long this string is and then go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 0>in from the answer from from one side and from

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.190
<v Speaker 0>the other side, and check whether the characters are the

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 0>same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.510
<v Speaker 0>So I need to know the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.550
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so integer n is um, string length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 0>So already I'm using this built in thing that you

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.150

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.270
<v Speaker 0>And I have a for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 0>So for integer I equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 0>And they want to keep going half way through because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,50,50,100,100]}

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 0>I'm coming at both ends at the same time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.850
<v Speaker 0>So I only need to go halfway through the string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Speaker 0>until I get to the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Speaker 0>So I want to keep going for until it's less

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 0>than n divided by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I want to iterate each time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 0>And what I want to say is if I'm looking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.090
<v Speaker 0>at the first letter and the last letter, if these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.570
<v Speaker 0>are not the same, it's not a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 0>Forget it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 0>If they are the same, maybe it's a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's keep on looking at the next ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.850
<v Speaker 0>So if these are not the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.490
<v Speaker 0>So I want to first check for when they're not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 0>the same because then I can immediately jump out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:10.410
<v Speaker 0>the testing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.370
<v Speaker 0>So if strings are at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,32,62]}

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.370
<v Speaker 0>So here we're using a built in method chart at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 0>which is going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.570
<v Speaker 0>So if I go back to documentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.250
<v Speaker 0>So char at I need to give it an integer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.340
<v Speaker 0>and it's going to return whatever character is at that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 0>point at that index in the string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 0>So I want the first one, which is whatever's at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:34.460
<v Speaker 0>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.220
<v Speaker 0>And I want this not to be equal to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.420
<v Speaker 0>You haven't seen this before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 0>But exclamation equal means not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 0>I mean, generally explanation means not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 0>Exclamation mark means not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.180
<v Speaker 0>And I've got string char at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.980
<v Speaker 0>So n minus one minus I puts me in the

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 0>right place if that's not clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.740
<v Speaker 0>Have a think about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.620
<v Speaker 0>Uh, then what do I want to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.580
<v Speaker 0>I want to return false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.420
<v Speaker 0>These are not the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.500
<v Speaker 0>It's not a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.580
<v Speaker 0>And I go through that whole loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 0>And if I never jump out, if it's ever not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.900
<v Speaker 0>right, I'm going to jump out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.540
<v Speaker 0>If I never jump out, then that means it is

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.140
<v Speaker 0>a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.860

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:13.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.940
<v Speaker 0>So either way there's a boolean outcome for this.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.940
<v Speaker 0>So all the red stuff has disappeared is happy with

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.460
<v Speaker 0>this now.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.670
<v Speaker 0>So what do we want to check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.430
<v Speaker 0>Give me give me something we want to check whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.510
<v Speaker 0>it's palindrome or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:20.630
<v Speaker 0>Taco cat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,97]}

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.230
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:21.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.790
<v Speaker 0>Is this a palindrome?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.890
<v Speaker 0>Yes, this is a palindrome, but if I do Taco

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.450
<v Speaker 0>cat two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.210
<v Speaker 0>This is not a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.490
<v Speaker 0>I could also take out the middle letter of Taco

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.410
<v Speaker 0>cat and just have tat cat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,45,100]}

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.130
<v Speaker 0>Is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.490
<v Speaker 0>Is that a palindrome?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Speaker 0>That is a palindrome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is just a little example of using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 0>some of these built in things to make life way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.650
<v Speaker 0>easier for you if you're trying to do that without

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 0>using that, that would be fiddly and annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so these are all things that might be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.570
<v Speaker 0>We've looked at char at concat we can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.410
<v Speaker 0>Let's just have a look at concat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 0>So we've looked at using the plus which is fine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 0>way to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 0>But you can also use the built in method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.650
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.570
<v Speaker 0>Give me a string someone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 0>Just a word or an expression.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.850
<v Speaker 0>Tree okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:27.100
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm going to make string two, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:34.780
<v Speaker 0>going to be a string one concatenated with another, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.220
<v Speaker 0>string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 0>Give me another string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 0>Huh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.100
<v Speaker 0>Apple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.180
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to print out string two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.620
<v Speaker 0>What was the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,27,100,100]}

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 0>Tree.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 0>Apple okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.340
<v Speaker 0>So it's just putting these together exactly as we would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 0>with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 0>Plus sometimes it's easy to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 0>Plus sometimes using plus gets really messy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.660
<v Speaker 0>And it's easier to use this built in method there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.100
<v Speaker 0>Compared to um ends with ends with is really useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 0>What's the final um oh does does a string that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 0>boolean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 0>Does a, does a string end with a certain thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.100
<v Speaker 0>that you pass into it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.500
<v Speaker 0>What is the index of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.060
<v Speaker 0>So here index of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.620
<v Speaker 0>This is a good example of when things are overloaded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.919
<v Speaker 0>Overloaded means it's doing more than one thing like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.159
<v Speaker 0>Plus is introducing integer addition and string concatenation and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:27.480
<v Speaker 0>forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.919
<v Speaker 0>So here Indexof either takes one argument which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:32.760
<v Speaker 0>string and it returns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.320
<v Speaker 0>So say we're doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440
<v Speaker 0>Let me just show you this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.840
<v Speaker 0>Um oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:47.679
<v Speaker 0>Integer index equals uh, let's say string one dot index

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.040
<v Speaker 0>of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.919
<v Speaker 0>What let's do um two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100]}

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to just print our index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,66,100]}

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.080
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.360
<v Speaker 0>That makes no sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.640
<v Speaker 0>No, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.840
<v Speaker 0>That's not how you use it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.600
<v Speaker 0>Have a look at the, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.520
<v Speaker 0>So minus one means that it doesn't exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 0>Have a look at what it's actually saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.480
<v Speaker 0>What I'm supposed to be passing in is the string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 0>that I'm trying to find out where this index is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,91,98]}

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say E.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.610
<v Speaker 0>What's the index of E?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84]}

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:24.610
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 0>So it sends.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58]}

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.250
<v Speaker 0>So it gives me two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.210
<v Speaker 0>But E is actually at two and three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.850
<v Speaker 0>So if we just put an index of with just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.210
<v Speaker 0>the string, that means the very first time that string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:33.850
<v Speaker 0>occurs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.650
<v Speaker 0>But also I can have an index of with an

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.130
<v Speaker 0>integer I, which means start searching at a particular place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say start searching at two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.370
<v Speaker 0>then tell me the next time you find an E.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 0>Start searching at three because if you start at two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:50.690
<v Speaker 0>it's going to find that two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 0>And now it's saying okay, there's also one at three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.610
<v Speaker 0>But if I was, for example, looking for a T

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.930
<v Speaker 0>or an R in index three, it's going to say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 0>minus one doesn't exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.530
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if I get rid of this and I say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.490
<v Speaker 0>just look anywhere in that string, it should give me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 0>an answer.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>There's lots.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 0>So there's about five different ways you can do index

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.300
<v Speaker 0>of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:23.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.940
<v Speaker 0>So there's lots these these things are all useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 0>You'll get really familiar with them okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.900
<v Speaker 0>But in Java just just as a point to remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,85,100]}

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.860
<v Speaker 0>strings are immutable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 0>But that means you can't change strings using these operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 0>You're just finding out things about these operations okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 0>So code for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.780
<v Speaker 0>Let me just check the time okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 0>Oh that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is a palindrome when we looked at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,52,100,63,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 0>this is extracting file names and extension from a command

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,44,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:49.740
<v Speaker 0>line argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 0>So here we want to look at substrings of we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 0>using index of um so we're trying to find we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.620
<v Speaker 0>got a long string of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 0>We're trying to find the dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.100
<v Speaker 0>And then we're looking at what comes before the dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.460
<v Speaker 0>and what comes after the dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.100
<v Speaker 0>So that's quite a common thing to do with strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, what's happening here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.820
<v Speaker 0>So here we're using read line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 0>So we're printing all lines from standard input containing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 0>string info.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:19.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.600
<v Speaker 0>So we're reading each line and then we're saying does

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.960
<v Speaker 0>this line contain info.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.760
<v Speaker 0>If so, print it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.480
<v Speaker 0>If not, ignore it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.560
<v Speaker 0>So we're looking for all the things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.480
<v Speaker 0>So we might have tag things with info.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.600
<v Speaker 0>That's what we want to print out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Other things are not relevant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.560
<v Speaker 0>Um here we're looking for uh, URLs from Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.000
<v Speaker 0>Any academic URL.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.960
<v Speaker 0>So we want a URL that's we want something that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 0>starts with HTTP and it's going to end with UK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 0>That's, that means that's what we're looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.440
<v Speaker 0>So here we're using starts with and ends with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.040
<v Speaker 0>So using these built in things we can do lots

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 0>of interesting and fun things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 0>So now we're looking at something a little bit different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Speaker 0>which is about formatting strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.160
<v Speaker 0>So some of you were using this I think this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 0>came up a little bit in the tutorial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:09.440
<v Speaker 0>Um so print that's we've mostly we've only done printing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.440
<v Speaker 0>so far with print Lynn or just print.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,34,100,100,100]}

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 0>So, so this is print is just the basic functionality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.560
<v Speaker 0>LNE means add a return line afterwards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[36,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.250
<v Speaker 0>So you have to pass it in everything you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.010
<v Speaker 0>But so here we can use concatenation to make a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.650
<v Speaker 0>longer string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is okay in simple cases if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.010
<v Speaker 0>just want to say the student name Lee is aged

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,80,100,89]}

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.850
<v Speaker 0>18, this is what we can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, but it's a little bit inelegant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 0>And if we have tons of these things, that can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.410
<v Speaker 0>be really annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 0>So there's nicer ways of formatting this stuff, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.410
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.490
<v Speaker 0>So this is the this is the string that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 0>want to produce.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so this is the basic string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.730
<v Speaker 0>And into this we want to slot variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.930
<v Speaker 0>We want we want lots of maybe lots of examples

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 0>of this with different instantiations of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.970
<v Speaker 0>And so what we use are these format specifiers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.170
<v Speaker 0>And those are uh percentage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 0>So the percentage indicates something is going to go here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 0>So you're waiting for a variable to fill in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 0>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.650
<v Speaker 0>That's what percentage means in a string like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, and s means the kind of thing that it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:16.730
<v Speaker 0>expecting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:16.980
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.580
<v Speaker 0>S means it's expecting that to be a string now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.820
<v Speaker 0>I've said before that strings are kind of black box.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.020
<v Speaker 0>And when you're doing things with it, Java's not looking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 0>inside the string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.580
<v Speaker 0>It's just treating it as a whole object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.220
<v Speaker 0>This is an exception to that case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:29.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.180
<v Speaker 0>So if you have a percentage it's going to look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.860
<v Speaker 0>in and it's going to know that that means something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.700
<v Speaker 0>specific and it's going to behave differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.940
<v Speaker 0>So the percentage is a placeholder is a placeholder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.060
<v Speaker 0>And percentage S is a placeholder for a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.100
<v Speaker 0>And these are called format specifiers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.580
<v Speaker 0>And when you actually do something with it the format

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.860
<v Speaker 0>specifier will be replaced by an actual value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.460
<v Speaker 0>So here we're using string dot format.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.820
<v Speaker 0>So the command is format.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.340
<v Speaker 0>And we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.500
<v Speaker 0>This is the string we want to create with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.020
<v Speaker 0>gaps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.780
<v Speaker 0>And then after that we have as many arguments as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.540
<v Speaker 0>we have percentage signs which is telling us what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.340
<v Speaker 0>going to go in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.140
<v Speaker 0>So here something called name is going to go in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.140
<v Speaker 0>the first one and something called age is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 0>go in the second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.580
<v Speaker 0>And these have got to be the the types have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.180
<v Speaker 0>got to match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.880
<v Speaker 0>So these have both got to be strings and name

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.800
<v Speaker 0>clearly is a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100]}

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.560
<v Speaker 0>Age might be a string or it might be an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.440
<v Speaker 0>integer, probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440
<v Speaker 0>And that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't mind if it's an integer because it will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.560
<v Speaker 0>automatically convert an integer to a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 0>But if I put in, well, I'll show you that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.040
<v Speaker 0>in a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 0>So let's just have a look at this in IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.920
<v Speaker 0>We'll just do it in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.640
<v Speaker 0>So string one is now going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do string is string dot format.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,52,100]}

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.120
<v Speaker 0>So I'm saying the method I want you to apply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 0>here is format.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 0>What is format is something that you find defined within

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.480
<v Speaker 0>the class string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.520
<v Speaker 0>So the student named what is the name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be a string I'm passing in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.960
<v Speaker 0>So percentage s o.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51]}

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 0>And I think we had for some I don't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 0>know why there's a single quote marks around those, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.890
<v Speaker 0>we'll just do that anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 0>To show that that can work is age percentage s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,73]}

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.290
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm going to pass in a name and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.810
<v Speaker 0>an age.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Speaker 0>Or I could just do this directly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Give me a, give me a name someone might have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.410
<v Speaker 0>James.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.290
<v Speaker 0>And this has been named how old is James?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 0>40.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.250
<v Speaker 0>Mature student.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.450
<v Speaker 0>This is not happy here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 0>We know why that is because I haven't told it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.170
<v Speaker 0>what the type is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to, um, let's print out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:52.930
<v Speaker 0>Uh, string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 0>So if we print that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.290
<v Speaker 0>The student named James is age 40.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:41:59.330 --> 00:41:59.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.250
<v Speaker 0>Now, obviously there's no point doing this if we're just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:04.890
<v Speaker 0>immediately putting what we want to be printed out inside

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.250
<v Speaker 0>the format statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.690
<v Speaker 0>The point of this is that you can do with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.250
<v Speaker 0>variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 0>So we can say here name is James.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:21.820
<v Speaker 0>And age is 40 and name is a string, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.860
<v Speaker 0>age is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 0>And then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 0>Name and age in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:32.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.900
<v Speaker 0>And that does exactly the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.740
<v Speaker 0>So now we can see we could be passing in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,75]}

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.060
<v Speaker 0>arrays with tons of data or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.340
<v Speaker 0>And it's going to do the same thing for all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.780
<v Speaker 0>of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.660
<v Speaker 0>Very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.260
<v Speaker 0>So very often you want to create strings that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.220
<v Speaker 0>formatted like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.380
<v Speaker 0>But in this case all we're doing is we're creating

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.500
<v Speaker 0>the string and we're printing it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 0>So then we don't actually need to create the string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,96]}

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 0>separately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 0>We can create this within a print statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 0>So this time instead of doing print Len we do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,30,100,100]}

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.180
<v Speaker 0>print f.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.380
<v Speaker 0>This means this is a kind of print statement in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.100
<v Speaker 0>which formatting string formatting will occur.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.900
<v Speaker 0>So all I'm going to do is put in into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.860
<v Speaker 0>that printf statement exactly what I put into the format

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 0>statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.100
<v Speaker 0>Get rid of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.000
<v Speaker 0>Don't need that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:13.600
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:17.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.480
<v Speaker 0>So that does exactly the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 0>So if if it's easy enough to do it within

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.120
<v Speaker 0>the print statement, you don't need to create this string

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100]}

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 0>and then print it just to just do all that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.880
<v Speaker 0>work within the print printf statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, but if you want to do other things with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 0>the string then probably using format is useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,71,100,100]}

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:35.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.800
<v Speaker 0>Printf statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93]}

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.680
<v Speaker 0>So here we've got an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.640
<v Speaker 0>This again this is expecting type string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.760
<v Speaker 0>And we're sending it a character.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 0>That's okay because Java can convert a character to a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:49.800
<v Speaker 0>string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 0>So it's not going to complain about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.320
<v Speaker 0>Um here we are using uh doubles doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,68,71,98]}

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.680
<v Speaker 0>It cannot convert to a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.920
<v Speaker 0>So if we say here H is 40.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,57,100,99]}

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.360
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, because whoops that's a problem there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,98,100,75,100,100]}

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 0>Is this not going to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 0>Oh that is going to work actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 0>So it will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 0>So we'll convert.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.650
<v Speaker 0>It will convert the double into a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.690
<v Speaker 0>Apologies about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.730
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes you don't want it to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.690
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you actually want it to be a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 0>So what we're going to do here is we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 0>to say, um, the value of pi is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Uh, percentage f.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100]}

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then what we're passing into that is um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.130
<v Speaker 0>pi the value of pi, which is math dot pi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.890
<v Speaker 0>So this is saying pi is a constant that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 0>defined within the maths package.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100]}

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.010
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,90]}

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 0>It's going to print it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,88,87,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:53.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.570
<v Speaker 0>So another useful thing you can see this chooses a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.610
<v Speaker 0>fairly arbitrary number of decimal points to print it out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,45,86,79,100]}

00:44:58.610 --> 00:44:58.730
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.730
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how it chooses that, but say we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.810
<v Speaker 0>wanted we only wanted two decimal places.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 0>We can put in here two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:04.850
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.090
<v Speaker 0>So percentage two with f so f.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.300
<v Speaker 0>By the way remember that this stands for float which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 0>is kind of the same as a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.060
<v Speaker 0>A double is a float that has twice as much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:13.540
<v Speaker 0>storage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.300
<v Speaker 0>For some reason, it's always double that we use for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,68,100]}

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 0>the type and f for the to specify here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 0>So what we're doing here with the point two C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,99,100,78]}

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 0>is just pointing out to two decimal places.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.220
<v Speaker 0>We can also put a slash n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 0>That means new line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.540
<v Speaker 0>And that's going to well actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.580
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.180
<v Speaker 0>That's the right kind of slash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.220
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise it's just a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100]}

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 0>And you can see this creates an empty line there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.580
<v Speaker 0>So just really quickly looking at code documentation we haven't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.900
<v Speaker 0>got very much time to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.500
<v Speaker 0>So code documentation is really really, really important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.380
<v Speaker 0>You have to tell people what's going on in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:53.620
<v Speaker 0>code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.300
<v Speaker 0>You have to tell yourself what's going on in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 0>code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.620
<v Speaker 0>But when you come back to it, otherwise your code

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 0>is really, really hard to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.060
<v Speaker 0>So there's some basic ways of doing this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 0>So the easiest way is just to put in something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.940
<v Speaker 0>here with double slash you can say this is my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.580
<v Speaker 0>comment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 0>Or if it's over multiple lines, you do slash star.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.520
<v Speaker 0>And that automatically creates a closing dash star.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100]}

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.560
<v Speaker 0>And you can say this is a comment okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 0>So this is useful just for yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 0>If you want a little aside to yourself to remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,40,30,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.440
<v Speaker 0>what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 0>But the main thing you should be doing is you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.880
<v Speaker 0>should be creating Java documentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:28.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.080
<v Speaker 0>So this is if we put dash star star, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,86,100,100]}

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 0>creates Java documentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.600
<v Speaker 0>And actually let's just show it in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.840
<v Speaker 0>This is going to work better here as an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.280
<v Speaker 0>So I've got this method is palindrome I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 0>put in my Java documentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.960
<v Speaker 0>That's not a very good example because it's not bringing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.200
<v Speaker 0>up the parameters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay I'm not quite sure what's going on there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.120
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.960
<v Speaker 0>Java documentation is automatically converted into HTML.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it contains Uh, so you can put HTML

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 0>tags in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.650
<v Speaker 0>But this is creating documentation that's similar to what you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 0>will see in the Java API.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.570
<v Speaker 0>You create your own stuff for your own methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 0>And this is really easy to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 0>You just have to use Java Doc and it does

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,91,100,100,100]}

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.650
<v Speaker 0>it all for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:22.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it should be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.490
<v Speaker 0>I'm not quite sure why it's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.210
<v Speaker 0>Why is Param not coming up?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:26.930
<v Speaker 0>Am I putting it in some wrong place?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.530
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah, I am.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:34.250
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 0>Live coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:38.050
<v Speaker 0>Such a pain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:39.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 0>So sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.570
<v Speaker 0>I was putting it inside the method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 0>That's not right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.770
<v Speaker 0>You put it above the method.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:47.570
<v Speaker 0>Now here it's automatically providing param and return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:48.050
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.850
<v Speaker 0>It knows that something's coming in and it's a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 0>And it knows that there is a return value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 0>So I put the string I want to check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.210
<v Speaker 0>Put it in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:04.010
<v Speaker 0>And um you probably want to put more, um, more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 0>specific things, but but it gets you to explain what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 0>goes in and what comes out, and then you want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 0>more documentation explaining what's actually happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, so and the three things it automatically does is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,63,75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.420
<v Speaker 0>parameter return and throw.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 0>So throws as if there's any exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.540
<v Speaker 0>Here we look briefly at throwing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.220
<v Speaker 0>This is throwing a null pointer exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 0>So you need to explain that in the documentation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh an IDE will automatically bring these things up for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 0>you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.580
<v Speaker 0>Uh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100]}

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 0>So how much commenting do you need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.580
<v Speaker 0>Every method, class and field contents should have Javadoc.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,73]}

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.460
<v Speaker 0>It will create this interface that's really useful within the

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:37.740
<v Speaker 0>code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 0>How much you need?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.620
<v Speaker 0>Not very much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, sometimes it's useful, so don't do it for super

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.100
<v Speaker 0>simple things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.260
<v Speaker 0>That's pointless.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.740
<v Speaker 0>This is really simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 0>People can figure that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.100
<v Speaker 0>Don't waste time with commenting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, don't say things that aren't true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.060
<v Speaker 0>This sounds really obvious, but actually this is part of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:55.820
<v Speaker 0>code maintenance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 0>As you change your code, some of the documentation is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 0>not going to be accurate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.460
<v Speaker 0>It's really important to change the code documentation as you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.180
<v Speaker 0>change the code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, so sometimes things get it makes it clearer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.880
<v Speaker 0>But you should um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.520
<v Speaker 0>So sometimes you can just do this by using sensible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:14.800
<v Speaker 0>names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:14.960
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 0>If you can do that, give things names that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 0>meaningful, then you don't have to put as much documentation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.200
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.120
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's kind of self commenting code, which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 0>bit of a I mean, it's a bit of an

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.200
<v Speaker 0>exaggeration.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you need comments, but the more so here we've

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.320
<v Speaker 0>got p names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100]}

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.000
<v Speaker 0>Then you don't need to explain that it's the names

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.680
<v Speaker 0>of the participants that's kind of obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 0>Uh, don't do stuff like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.960
<v Speaker 0>It's very tempting, but it's kind of annoying and it's

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 0>not considered good practice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.160
<v Speaker 0>Even though you will be, um, sometimes commenting or sometimes

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.760
<v Speaker 0>working with code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.560
<v Speaker 0>That's really annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 0>So every method, class and field within code just to

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 0>explain it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.960
<v Speaker 0>If it's not obvious and you need to know, all

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 0>right, uh, and do consistent coding style just makes it

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 0>much easier to read.
