00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.610

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.890

<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170
<v Speaker 0>I think the problem is they're not making themselves visible.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.970

<v Speaker 0>So let me just quickly show you The week one

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 0>results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this obviously is not the final results from

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 0>the survey because it's still open until Friday.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 0>Not all of you have done that, but actually a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.710
<v Speaker 0>lot of you have done this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.710
<v Speaker 0>So having a look at your background, um, actually 63%

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.590

<v Speaker 0>level or some kind of similar school leaving qualification.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.230
<v Speaker 0>In computing, this is higher than usual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.590
<v Speaker 0>Normally it's only about 5050, but you can see a

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.590
<v Speaker 0>lot of the class do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.630
<v Speaker 0>But then for a lot of the class, about 35%

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 0>of the class don't have very much higher computing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 0>They've either done a little bit or they've done none

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.310

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100]}

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 0>So you can see it's quite a mixed class there,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.510
<v Speaker 0>although less mix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,91]}

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.110
<v Speaker 0>Unusual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 0>More than half of you have some experience of OOP,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 0>but not 20% have done a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 0>Most of you have done just a little bit, or

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 0>some of you have never done any.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 0>This is again, this is higher.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 0>I'm surprised how many people have already done OOP.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 0>So there's maybe a bit of repetition for those of

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 0>you just have to bear with us because this is

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520
<v Speaker 0>for the people who haven't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 0>And also the reminder is often really useful.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.720

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.040

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.880

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.770
<v Speaker 0>We're going to say else.

<v Speaker 0>The verdict is Roasting.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 0>And then once we've gone through these options, we will

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.510

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.870

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 0>Now if you see verdict, they were all greyed out

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.990

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.830

<v Speaker 0>used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.110

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.910

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.310

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76]}

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.790
<v Speaker 0>So here are all our options.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.070
<v Speaker 0>At the moment the temperature is zero.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.990
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a just have a look at that.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Speaker 0>Think what is it going to do when the temperature

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.190
<v Speaker 0>is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.150
<v Speaker 0>So let's run through that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.230
<v Speaker 0>So actually I'm going to put the temperature to let's

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.990

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.190

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 0>It's normal.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.400
<v Speaker 0>Let's put it at 12, That none of these are

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.000
<v Speaker 0>going to apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.200
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to print out roasting.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:51.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.240
<v Speaker 0>That's what we think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 0>None of these none of these ifs apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.280
<v Speaker 0>It goes straight onto the else that's roasting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.200
<v Speaker 0>If we go down to nine then we'd expect it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.720

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.960
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to set verdict to normal because this

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.920

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.760

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.200

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.360

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.280

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 0>So now I'm going to assign this value to verdict.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.010
<v Speaker 0>But because it means this condition is going to assign

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 0>a new value to it, it's going to write verdict

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 0>equals normally normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.210
<v Speaker 0>This is why these are greyed out because it's saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.250
<v Speaker 0>it's never actually going to use these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 0>Because if any of these are true, this is also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 0>going to be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.290
<v Speaker 0>So you're going to be overwriting what you've done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.210
<v Speaker 0>And this is why we need else conditions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:17.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 0>Because once we've once we've found where we want to

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.050

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 0>the things that don't apply in that situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.370
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say if temperature is less than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.810

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to put this in an else loop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.370
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 0>Else if temperature is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 0>Less than one the verdict is nippy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 0>And then I have another else in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.010
<v Speaker 0>Else if temperature is less than ten, verdict is normal.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.900
<v Speaker 0>And then we've got the final else here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.860
<v Speaker 0>And that should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I've got to close these brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.940
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully this is going to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.700
<v Speaker 0>So now can you see it's nested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.740
<v Speaker 0>And if I run that now if I haven't made

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.500
<v Speaker 0>a stupid error it should work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 0>And it's saying okay because I've nested that properly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.300
<v Speaker 0>I've got my ifs and I've got my elses right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,87]}

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 0>So it's always it always knows which path to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 0>down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 0>There's no confusion about checking multiple conditions by the way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 0>Just as an aside, what would happen say, we talked

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 0>a little bit about the importance of curly braces in

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.580
<v Speaker 0>these loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if I just remove these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:25.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 0>So now there's no curly braces around the first condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 0>Let's put it down to minus six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 0>So that will be relevant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:32.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.900
<v Speaker 0>So who thinks that's going to make a difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 0>Do you think that's going to we are going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,68,100,100]}

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.100
<v Speaker 0>have a different output.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 0>Some people do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 0>Who thinks it's going to be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.440
<v Speaker 0>Probably more people think it's going to be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 0>So if we run it and see, we'd expect that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 0>to say, wear a sweater and it's exactly the same,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.960
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't make a difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 0>Why is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 0>Is because there is only one line, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.720
<v Speaker 0>So if you don't use curly braces, Java will assume

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100]}

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.440
<v Speaker 0>the loop is just the first line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.920
<v Speaker 0>In this case, it genuinely is just the first line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.800
<v Speaker 0>So you don't need the braces from a from Java's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.360
<v Speaker 0>point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 0>You do need them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.160
<v Speaker 0>From a readability point of view, though, it's not going

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 0>to fail if you don't do it, but it's way

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.600
<v Speaker 0>more readable if you do, so just always put those

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:12.840
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's everything that I wanted to do from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.760
<v Speaker 0>the from the last lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 0>So now we're going to move on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800
<v Speaker 0>I just got my water up.

<v Speaker 0>Sorry about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 0>So we are going to look at arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.680
<v Speaker 0>So arrays are something that you should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,98]}

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 0>I'm just looking through these beforehand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.440
<v Speaker 0>So let me go up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you should be kind of familiar with arrays

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 0>from math.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.770
<v Speaker 0>But arrays are a very fundamental part of most programming

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.130
<v Speaker 0>languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.650
<v Speaker 0>There's something you're going to use all the time in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 0>Java, and you would use all the time in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.610
<v Speaker 0>lot of different languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 0>So arrays are essentially a way of keeping things together,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:59.730 --> 00:15:59.970
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 0>Lots of things that you want to consider.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.290
<v Speaker 0>At the same time, you keep them all together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 0>So it's a yeah, it's a way of storing different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 0>kinds of data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 0>So importantly in Java, in an array, every every item

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.890
<v Speaker 0>of an array has to be the same type of

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.530
<v Speaker 0>You can't have an array with one element that's a

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 0>double and one that's an integer and one that's a

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 0>string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.130
<v Speaker 0>Everything has got to be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.850
<v Speaker 0>So here we're looking at initialising.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.530
<v Speaker 0>An array that is is an array of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 0>And it's got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 0>So here we've got these ten numbers A0 to A9.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.170
<v Speaker 0>And we want them all to be we want them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 0>all to start off as 0.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.530
<v Speaker 0>They're doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:46.060
<v Speaker 0>0.0 is the default value of a double, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 0>may then want to do other things, like here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.220
<v Speaker 0>We're now assigning a new value to A4.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.420
<v Speaker 0>We might want to do addition with some elements of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.740
<v Speaker 0>the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.940
<v Speaker 0>We want to do things with bits of the array,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.940
<v Speaker 0>but we want to keep these things together okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we initialise these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100]}

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.180
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100]}

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 0>Let me just go straight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.819
<v Speaker 0>Let's go straight to IntelliJ and have a look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:07.980
<v Speaker 0>it here how we do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.420
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to bring up arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.900
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to I'm going to make an array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.980
<v Speaker 0>of doubles right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to call it array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 0>And it's already read because I haven't told it what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.660
<v Speaker 0>type it is yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.579
<v Speaker 0>As you know Java really wants me to tell everything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:25.260
<v Speaker 0>once.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 0>Always be very clear about types.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm going to use the keyword new here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.780
<v Speaker 0>And this is something that you'll get very familiar with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 0>What does new mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 0>New means I'm creating something that doesn't exist before, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 0>I need a space in memory for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.680
<v Speaker 0>So new is essentially finding a space in memory so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.040
<v Speaker 0>that when I create this new thing, there's somewhere for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Speaker 0>it to live.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.600
<v Speaker 0>Now, so far we've only looked at doing things with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 0>literals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to do this with literals, but if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 0>you're creating a new object, which is essentially what an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.640
<v Speaker 0>array is you use, you need the keyword new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now I need to indicate what I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 0>indicate that it's an array, which I do with square

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.560
<v Speaker 0>brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 0>And I have to say what kind of thing is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.160
<v Speaker 0>going to be in the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.880
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to do an array of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.440
<v Speaker 0>So this is how I declare that double the word

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 0>double or the word whatever the type is with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160
<v Speaker 0>square brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 0>Now also when I'm creating this space in memory, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 0>need to say how much space do I need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.120
<v Speaker 0>So I need to say how big is the array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 0>going to be?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.720
<v Speaker 0>So when you're creating arrays, you already know when you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.760
<v Speaker 0>when you create them, you need to know how many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.880
<v Speaker 0>elements they're going to have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.960
<v Speaker 0>You can't do this on the fly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 0>You have to declare this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 0>And you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.440
<v Speaker 0>You do it by putting the number in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.200
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say this is an array with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.920
<v Speaker 0>ten elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 0>It could be anything but I want to create an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 0>array with ten elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.490
<v Speaker 0>Now I need to tell it what type it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 0>and the type of this thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 0>A new thing I've created called array is a double

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.210
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 0>So you may think this looks kind of redundant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.450
<v Speaker 0>I've literally just told it that this is an array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 0>of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 0>And then Java is like, oh yeah, but I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 0>know what the type is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.570
<v Speaker 0>So I have to say it's an array of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 0>So you have this same thing on both sides of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.890
<v Speaker 0>the of the declaration, which maybe seems a little redundant,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.330
<v Speaker 0>but this is what you have to do in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.650
<v Speaker 0>You have to be really explicit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.410
<v Speaker 0>Here I don't need to put how big it is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.330
<v Speaker 0>because the purpose of this is not to create anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.570
<v Speaker 0>It's just to say the type and the type is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.490
<v Speaker 0>an array of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.930
<v Speaker 0>So here I have to put the size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.410
<v Speaker 0>But on the left hand side very bad left and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,55,100,100]}

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:24.650
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm just saying what the type is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now I can do stuff with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 0>Let's try system to print out an element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 0>So let's print out a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79]}

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.340
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 0>So what this means here is I'm saying here's an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,97]}

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:45.540
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.580
<v Speaker 0>And what I want you to do, Java, is to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.220
<v Speaker 0>find whatever is in position two, and then it's going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.740
<v Speaker 0>to print it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.180
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what happens when I do that okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.740
<v Speaker 0>And it's going to print 0.0 right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.500
<v Speaker 0>So first this might seem a little strange.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.420
<v Speaker 0>I've just created this new array but I haven't set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.340
<v Speaker 0>And I've said there's ten elements in it and they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 0>all of type double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,97,100]}

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 0>But I haven't said anything about what value these things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:06.940
<v Speaker 0>have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 0>And yet it is printing out a value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.220
<v Speaker 0>So this is normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.220
<v Speaker 0>This is because you have these default values in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.860
<v Speaker 0>So if I don't assign anything a value it will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.460
<v Speaker 0>use a default values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100]}

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.900
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100]}

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is exactly what I've been showing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 0>And then I can do all sorts of things here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 0>Like I can assign new values so I can say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.980
<v Speaker 0>uh array two equals uh let's say 2.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,94,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 0>And now you can see I've changed this value to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 0>2.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm printing it out and you can see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.800
<v Speaker 0>that it's got its new value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.240
<v Speaker 0>And I can do things like adding things I could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Speaker 0>do, um, int uh, no, let's make that a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 0>That would make more sense in sum equals um array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.760
<v Speaker 0>two plus array three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.320
<v Speaker 0>And that I would expect to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 0>What's the value of this going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.560
<v Speaker 0>2.5 yeah okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 0>So I can manipulate things in arrays in this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.440
<v Speaker 0>And we all get really practice at doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.080
<v Speaker 0>Um so what kinds of things would you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080
<v Speaker 0>put in arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.240
<v Speaker 0>Basically anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 0>All kinds of stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 0>So we'll look in a minute about using an example,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.280
<v Speaker 0>using playing cards in a deck.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 0>But you could keep all the undergraduate students at UAE.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,98,85]}

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 0>That would be um, well that might be an array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.210
<v Speaker 0>of strings if you're using their names, or you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.530
<v Speaker 0>have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 0>Identifier like integer identifiers or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.650
<v Speaker 0>All the characters in a book are just all kinds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.210
<v Speaker 0>of things that you want to keep together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 0>These are really, really common.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 0>Now, one thing that's really important about array is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 0>they're index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100]}

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.530
<v Speaker 0>So you've already seen that when I say whatever is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,76]}

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.330
<v Speaker 0>at position two it that has a meaning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.490
<v Speaker 0>Something is at position two in an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.730
<v Speaker 0>Because arrays are ordered and a little bit counterintuitive to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 0>begin with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.010
<v Speaker 0>But something you'll get super used to is that indexes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.090
<v Speaker 0>always start at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 0>So the the first element in an array is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.370
<v Speaker 0>in position one, it's in position zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.130
<v Speaker 0>The thing in position one is the second in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.370
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.410
<v Speaker 0>So here Rebecca is the first value in this array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.450
<v Speaker 0>at position zero Isla is the second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 0>That's at position one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.050
<v Speaker 0>There's a lot of silly errors that come in because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 0>people forget that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.650
<v Speaker 0>But you will get pretty used to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 0>So this array is of is length five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 0>There's five different slots, so when I create this, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.060
<v Speaker 0>say it's an array of length five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.900
<v Speaker 0>And in memory there will be five different slots created.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.580
<v Speaker 0>The final index index of an array is always one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 0>less than the length, because the first one is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.980
<v Speaker 0>So what's happening in memory?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 0>So if we have primitives, they all have a different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.660
<v Speaker 0>space in memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 0>So they're all pointing to a different bit of memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.340
<v Speaker 0>But with an array you just have one position in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.500
<v Speaker 0>memory for the whole array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Speaker 0>And then within that there's different slots in the memory

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 0>for each element of the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.620
<v Speaker 0>So you're just pointing to this, this one entry in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.060
<v Speaker 0>the memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.500
<v Speaker 0>And all of the stuff is saved there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,99,100,100]}

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 0>Don't worry too much about what memory means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 0>If that's really unfamiliar and strange, we will be getting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 0>on to memory in a bit and we'll look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 0>this in a lot more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.580
<v Speaker 0>So arrays are kind of objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.820
<v Speaker 0>They're kind of they're special kinds of objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.660
<v Speaker 0>We haven't really spoken very much about objects at all,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.780
<v Speaker 0>let alone what it means to be a special kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.220
<v Speaker 0>of object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 0>This is something that we will get onto later and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,97]}

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.920
<v Speaker 0>we'll be talking a lot about in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so we looked at all of this and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 0>we declared it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 0>This is how you declare it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.320
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.960
<v Speaker 0>Let's do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.240
<v Speaker 0>So, so this is a for loop going through initialising

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.960
<v Speaker 0>things, um, that we will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960
<v Speaker 0>We'll come across this later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.600
<v Speaker 0>So this is if you want to go through and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 0>give a different value to everything, you can do that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 0>rather than having the actual default value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82]}

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.680
<v Speaker 0>We've already seen that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.480
<v Speaker 0>And here are the default values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 0>If it's an integer default value of zero double is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,56,100,99,100,100,93,100,79,96]}

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.640
<v Speaker 0>0.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 0>Boolean is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.400
<v Speaker 0>String is null.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.840
<v Speaker 0>So if you haven't told it the value of any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.880
<v Speaker 0>of these things, that is what it's going to default

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.120
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 0>And as we said before, everything in array has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.160
<v Speaker 0>have the same type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.320
<v Speaker 0>Uh all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100]}

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.040
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at a different sort of array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to make an array of strings and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 0>it's going to be of I'm going to call it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.570
<v Speaker 0>buildings, and it's going to be different buildings that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.650
<v Speaker 0>might be going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.730
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say, oh, sorry, I haven't shown

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 0>you this shorthand yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:49.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.330
<v Speaker 0>So here's a shorthand for making arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.090
<v Speaker 0>So what we saw before with the square brackets that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.690
<v Speaker 0>will create an array of things that have just a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.530
<v Speaker 0>default value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I want an array so there's going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.370
<v Speaker 0>to be four elements in an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.810
<v Speaker 0>So I can do it like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.010
<v Speaker 0>Uh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.370
<v Speaker 0>New uh string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.650
<v Speaker 0>So I can do it like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 0>This has created what I want, but nothing has any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,30,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.170
<v Speaker 0>value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 0>So I can go through one by one, giving it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.010
<v Speaker 0>values, missing a bracket somehow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, but there's another way to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.650
<v Speaker 0>If I already know every element and it's maybe not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 0>too long a list, so this is quite easy to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.530
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 0>There's a shorthand way of doing this where we use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.500
<v Speaker 0>curly braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 0>So normally everything in an array is always square braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,57,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.900
<v Speaker 0>But if you want to do this initialisation trick, use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.700
<v Speaker 0>curly braces and you just list everything that's going into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.260
<v Speaker 0>your array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.540
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to instead of doing this, I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.620
<v Speaker 0>to say, here are my curly braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.540
<v Speaker 0>And get rid of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.340
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to just list everything in this init.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,95,95]}

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.740
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing is going to be my house.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.940
<v Speaker 0>And then and then we separate things in the array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.620
<v Speaker 0>with commas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:07.740
<v Speaker 0>Let's have the Informatics Forum and Appleton Tower.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.340
<v Speaker 0>And what's another building in Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 0>What's that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 0>Castle okay Edinburgh Castle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:18.820
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.660
<v Speaker 0>That'll do for now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:22.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.300
<v Speaker 0>So let's first of all here's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.500
<v Speaker 0>So let's just run that check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 0>It's happy with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.980
<v Speaker 0>So it's created this thing I can't see it because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.980
<v Speaker 0>I'm not doing anything with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.800
<v Speaker 0>But now I know that I've changed the memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.320
<v Speaker 0>I've created a bit of memory in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.280
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46]}

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.840
<v Speaker 0>And this is what's in it now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.320
<v Speaker 0>I haven't used the keyword new, which is very rare.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.280
<v Speaker 0>When you're creating something new in memory, you almost always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 0>use new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Speaker 0>But with this special shortcut, you don't have to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.360
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 0>So if we print it out, what's it going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.640
<v Speaker 0>look like?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.600
<v Speaker 0>Uh, buildings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is the name of array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, no it isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.080
<v Speaker 0>This is the name of the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.120
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to print this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:58.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.160
<v Speaker 0>And this is what it's going to return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Speaker 0>Which is not what I might want it to return.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 0>So it's kind of annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.720
<v Speaker 0>In Java, you can't just print arrays out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.840
<v Speaker 0>You have to go through and print out the elements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.160
<v Speaker 0>of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.520
<v Speaker 0>So this is essentially a kind of reference to it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 0>in memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.960
<v Speaker 0>It's not telling me what the contents of that is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 0>which is probably when I print out an array what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Speaker 0>I actually want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 0>So um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88]}

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.280
<v Speaker 0>But what I can do is I can get it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.930
<v Speaker 0>to print out, Um, what is in each slot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,99,100,100]}

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.850
<v Speaker 0>So okay, I'm going to do print out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.090
<v Speaker 0>This is telling me this this I'm saying print out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 0>what is ever whatever is an index one of building.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,98,100,100,58,98,100,100,63]}

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.890
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to go back to woo Clap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,87]}

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to open this question I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 0>hide the results okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.020
<v Speaker 0>So I can also get it to tell me the

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.500
<v Speaker 0>length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.340
<v Speaker 0>Now this is something we haven't seen before using built

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 0>in methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.580
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.780
<v Speaker 0>So when you apply methods to an object you use

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.380
<v Speaker 0>a dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 0>So here I'm going to put buildings dot length okay.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 0>So length is a built in method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 0>And I'm applying it to an object called buildings using

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.660
<v Speaker 0>this dot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.340
<v Speaker 0>So what this is saying is whatever length, whatever length

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.540
<v Speaker 0>is do it to buildings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:11.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 0>And what length is, is something that tells you the

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.860

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 0>So it's something that's built in for arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.020
<v Speaker 0>So if I run this, it's going to tell me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.380

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 0>That means it's got four elements in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, other things I can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 0>So I can say right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 0>What is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.920
<v Speaker 0>So it's for long.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.680
<v Speaker 0>I want to know what is at the in in

<v Speaker 0>index for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 0>So I can do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.520
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.760
<v Speaker 0>So the what I want to do here is I

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 0>want to make this, this number that is returning.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.080
<v Speaker 0>I want that to be the index I'm looking at.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.840
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to ask what's in that position.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.080
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 0>So what this is mean I'm not giving it an

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.040

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 0>the index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.480
<v Speaker 0>I'm getting it to work out a number and then

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.720

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.040
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't really like this.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:01.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.320
<v Speaker 0>So it's got this yellow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.120

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.920
<v Speaker 0>But it's not very good coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what's going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 0>So I now get an array index out of bounds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,44,100,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.120
<v Speaker 0>exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 0>And it's telling me the yellow is telling me array

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.520
<v Speaker 0>index is out of bounds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 0>Now we should know why that is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.640
<v Speaker 0>Because the building the list of is of length four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,56]}

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 0>What's the index for?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,43,100,100]}

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:27.570
<v Speaker 0>Nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.250
<v Speaker 0>Because the highest index is three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:30.770
<v Speaker 0>It goes from 0 to 3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 0>So the highest index in any array is always length

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 0>minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 0>So if we put this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.370
<v Speaker 0>So if we put a minus one in here, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.810
<v Speaker 0>this is saying now is give me whatever is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.010
<v Speaker 0>last element of this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.810
<v Speaker 0>And that is something you might quite often do when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.890
<v Speaker 0>you're coding what is last in this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.010
<v Speaker 0>If I do that it's going to tell me Edinburgh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 0>Castle that is in the final index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.290
<v Speaker 0>So this array index out of bounds is something that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:57.770
<v Speaker 0>happens quite often when you're coding because you've somehow messed

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.090

<v Speaker 0>What's the next question?

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99]}

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.850

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.730

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.410
<v Speaker 0>look through this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.370

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 0>we've been looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.690
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not going to go through those all now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.460
<v Speaker 0>So we've got this Is a dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,96,100,100]}

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 0>So maybe you remember doing dot products in maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, so essentially what we're doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.420
<v Speaker 0>A dot product is the sum of the products of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.620
<v Speaker 0>their corresponding components.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.580
<v Speaker 0>So you multiply them together and then you add those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.340
<v Speaker 0>all those multiplications together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100]}

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.500
<v Speaker 0>So what we're doing here we're setting up these two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 0>arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.460
<v Speaker 0>And we're using this shorthand here with the curly braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.980
<v Speaker 0>Um so x is has got three values y has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.820
<v Speaker 0>got three values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.060
<v Speaker 0>Now we're trying to find out what the ultimate sum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.140
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.220
<v Speaker 0>So we start off with an initial value for some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 0>which is some is a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,97,100,100]}

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.500
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to be 0.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 0>And then we go through um go through these this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.060
<v Speaker 0>And every time we are multiplying whatever is in ith

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,89,87,99]}

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 0>position of x with the ith position of y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.380
<v Speaker 0>That's probably familiar with you, if you can remember dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.540
<v Speaker 0>products, if you can't have a look at it, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.860
<v Speaker 0>you want to figure out what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:16.820
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.360
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to have a little question about that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 0>a little bit later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 0>So we're creating an array with random values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 0>So sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:33.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 0>So here you can see this is another thing we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 0>haven't we haven't done yet built in packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.440
<v Speaker 0>So obviously there's tons of things that people do all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:41.800
<v Speaker 0>the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.680
<v Speaker 0>You don't want to build it in yourself all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:43.800
<v Speaker 0>time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.000
<v Speaker 0>So here's a package called maths packages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 0>Start with uppercase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 0>And this is just a whole package of different maths

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.440
<v Speaker 0>things you want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 0>And one of the methods in there is called random.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 0>What random does is it just finds a random value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.560
<v Speaker 0>So what this is saying is create something completely random

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.240
<v Speaker 0>and assign that to A1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93]}

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.160
<v Speaker 0>So now we're creating an array and we don't know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.560
<v Speaker 0>what the values are but they're not 0.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 0>We're creating random stuff for those values to be um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.000
<v Speaker 0>uh let's do the printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 0>So let's do printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 0>So we tried printing this out, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.960
<v Speaker 0>Just using buildings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 0>And we saw that that didn't work because you can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.840
<v Speaker 0>do that with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 0>So what you have to do with the rays is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,37,100]}

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 0>you have to go through one by one and print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 0>them all out yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.770
<v Speaker 0>So we can do this with a for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.890
<v Speaker 0>I get rid of that for now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:32.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:36.330
<v Speaker 0>So for everything in the array we're going to print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:36.810
<v Speaker 0>it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:37.410
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember for loops from the last lecture

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 0>we have the three things in the header.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 0>First of all we have the counter which we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.570
<v Speaker 0>to initialise to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 0>So in t equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 0>And then how long are we going to go through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:51.610
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.650
<v Speaker 0>How many times are we going to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.130
<v Speaker 0>We're going to do this for every element of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.450
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.890
<v Speaker 0>So we can have at whilst as long as I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,37,70,100,100,100,86]}

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.970
<v Speaker 0>is less than building buildings dot length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 0>Because as we've just seen, when we get to buildings

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.210
<v Speaker 0>length then we're outside the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.770
<v Speaker 0>So as long as it's less than that we'll keep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.129
<v Speaker 0>going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:11.370
<v Speaker 0>You also could have I is less than or equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.850
<v Speaker 0>to buildings length minus one, which is saying go to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.730
<v Speaker 0>the end and then stop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.090
<v Speaker 0>This is saying stop before you get past the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.250
<v Speaker 0>as effectively the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.690
<v Speaker 0>It's slightly more concise this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.490
<v Speaker 0>And then we're iterating each time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 0>What I++.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93]}

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:27.060
<v Speaker 0>And then every time we're just going to print out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.700
<v Speaker 0>whatever is in the ith position in the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 0>Buildings ie.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,25]}

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:36.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.220
<v Speaker 0>So if we do this it should print out everything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 0>for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.980
<v Speaker 0>So here this is all the elements of the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.139
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.020
<v Speaker 0>Now this is not what I'm going to show you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.940
<v Speaker 0>now is not particularly apropos to arrays, but it's something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.379
<v Speaker 0>a little coding hack that you need to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.860
<v Speaker 0>And I think it's as good a time as any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.940
<v Speaker 0>to do it, because as you can see, we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.460
<v Speaker 0>this little yellow thing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.380
<v Speaker 0>It's saying it's not completely happy about this for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.780
<v Speaker 0>It's not wrong, but it's not very neat programming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.940
<v Speaker 0>So what it's saying here is for loop can be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.740
<v Speaker 0>replaced with enhanced for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,99]}

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.020
<v Speaker 0>So for loops are pretty repetitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.220
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.420
<v Speaker 0>We always have we start with an iterator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.380
<v Speaker 0>We go on until we've got a condition met and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 0>then we iterate by one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.320
<v Speaker 0>And what we're essentially mostly doing or very often doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.240
<v Speaker 0>in a for loop is just going through a list

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,99,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.840
<v Speaker 0>of things and doing the same thing to each of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.120
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.360
<v Speaker 0>So for everything in the list, we do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 0>And um, because this is really common, there's shorthand for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 0>it which is called enhanced for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.200
<v Speaker 0>So one of the nice things about using an IDE

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 0>like IntelliJ is that it does a lot of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 0>stuff for you, so I don't actually have to replace

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.800
<v Speaker 0>I can just choose here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.200
<v Speaker 0>Is suggesting do you want to replace this with an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 0>enhanced for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.080
<v Speaker 0>So fine I'll do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.760
<v Speaker 0>And now it's changed that for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 0>So this is the anatomy of an enhanced for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 0>So we just have this one thing in the header.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.520
<v Speaker 0>So this is what we're this is what we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 0>through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 0>This is this is our array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.840
<v Speaker 0>We're going to step through the array and we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.120
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.640
<v Speaker 0>So the colon should be read as in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.760
<v Speaker 0>So what this is saying for everything called building that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.560
<v Speaker 0>is in this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.280
<v Speaker 0>Buildings do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.960
<v Speaker 0>What we're going to do here is print it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.080
<v Speaker 0>You might think it could be, um, this is very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.960
<v Speaker 0>common way of doing it, but we could just put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 0>a, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,99]}

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.170
<v Speaker 0>We could just put X or whatever, you know, whatever

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:25.490
<v Speaker 0>we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.370
<v Speaker 0>So for every thing in buildings, do something for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 0>If we look at that, it's going to be exactly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 0>So enhance for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100]}

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.730
<v Speaker 0>You can get IntelliJ to write them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.770
<v Speaker 0>You can write them yourselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.170
<v Speaker 0>The colon means for for everything sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 0>It means n for everything in this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:40.610
<v Speaker 0>Do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.730
<v Speaker 0>So basically most of the time we're using for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.530
<v Speaker 0>You kind of want to do the enhance for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100,100]}

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.010
<v Speaker 0>only other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.850
<v Speaker 0>The only situation when you don't want to do this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 0>is if you're actually using the iterator to do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 0>So when we looked at, um, did we do it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 0>when we were doing here when we looked at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.650
<v Speaker 0>So when we looked at this dot product we're actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.570
<v Speaker 0>using this iterator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.490
<v Speaker 0>We want to know what's in the ith position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 0>Uh and we're multiplying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,89,90]}

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 0>Actually we could do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:09.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:10.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.530
<v Speaker 0>So we'll have a we'll have a look at examples

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,41,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.050
<v Speaker 0>when you can and can't use for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,92]}

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 0>If you if you need to know the iterator, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.220
<v Speaker 0>you're doing something with the iterator, um then you Then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,56,100]}

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.100
<v Speaker 0>you need to use a traditional for loop, but usually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.340
<v Speaker 0>use enhance for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,64,100,100]}

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we've done the printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.940
<v Speaker 0>We've done random values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 0>Um we can look at maximum values of the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.700
<v Speaker 0>Um and here so this is a little for loop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100]}

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.540
<v Speaker 0>that's been written.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.180
<v Speaker 0>And again this could be an enhanced for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 0>Um and it's saying we want to find the maximum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.580
<v Speaker 0>value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.340
<v Speaker 0>So let's go through everything in the array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.580
<v Speaker 0>We'll start off with the maximum value being the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 0>element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.820
<v Speaker 0>Um and then we check everything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.220
<v Speaker 0>If it's higher than the one we've already got, we'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:52.820
<v Speaker 0>replace it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 0>And if not, we'll just ignore it and keep going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 0>until we have finished.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.740
<v Speaker 0>And that will give us the maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 0>So this is lots of different things you might want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 0>to do with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.380
<v Speaker 0>Copying one array to another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.020
<v Speaker 0>So I don't want to go through all these examples

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.340
<v Speaker 0>in a huge amount of detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.260

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.960

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77]}

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.120

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.400

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 0>Here are some things that might go in the blanks.

<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.360
<v Speaker 0>So what's going in blank one for a start.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.760
<v Speaker 0>So the header of the for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.960

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 0>I'll leave it a little bit longer.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.320
<v Speaker 0>So most people have got is that the right answer?

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.890

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so number one is the second most popular answer.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.490
<v Speaker 0>So in t equals one is correct.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.290

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.210
<v Speaker 0>If that was I's less than or equal to length

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.810

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100]}

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.290
<v Speaker 0>You keep on until it's equal to the final index.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.610
<v Speaker 0>But if you say it's less than so length minus

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.530

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.850
<v Speaker 0>So you're not going to get to the final index.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.210

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.170
<v Speaker 0>Here there's commas instead of semicolons.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.370

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 0>I don't know why I do that, because you always

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 0>What's wrong with this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.590
<v Speaker 0>look at all the different commands and to order them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.990
<v Speaker 0>in the right way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.350
<v Speaker 0>And I especially put in that new slide because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,36,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.230
<v Speaker 0>screwed that up last year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 0>And it should have worked, but I didn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,46,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.950
<v Speaker 0>It didn't work anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,100,86]}

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.790
<v Speaker 0>So what we have to do here, first of all,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.570
<v Speaker 0>we have to declare what some is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,88]}

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.930
<v Speaker 0>So we've got some we're going to use some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.250
<v Speaker 0>So we've got to declare what it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.530
<v Speaker 0>And then here we've got what we're doing here is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 0>okay, so this is shorthand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.610
<v Speaker 0>Have we seen this shorthand before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is a nice way of just saying instead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.490
<v Speaker 0>of saying sum equals sum plus something, you just say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.610
<v Speaker 0>sum plus equals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.890
<v Speaker 0>And that just means by adding something new to sum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.090
<v Speaker 0>and reassigning it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.050
<v Speaker 0>And then you're going to print out, um, so we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 0>doing the average value of an array of doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.250
<v Speaker 0>So we're getting the sum and then we're dividing it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.210
<v Speaker 0>by the length okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.090
<v Speaker 0>If that's not clear have a look through it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.490
<v Speaker 0>If it's still not clear then go along to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 0>lab okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 0>So do we have time to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.610
<v Speaker 0>The um so this here we're going to look at,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.730
<v Speaker 0>uh, slightly more complex different arrays where we are trying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.210
<v Speaker 0>to represent a pack of cards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, let me just see if we can start doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.490
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 0>What is a deck of cards?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,94,50,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh, cards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,97]}

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.660
<v Speaker 0>Sorry about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, I forgot to get this figured.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.740
<v Speaker 0>It's using the wrong version.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no, don't do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so maybe we should just leave this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.740
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.260
<v Speaker 0>Hang on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 0>I've got to just change the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.820
<v Speaker 0>Version of Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.340
<v Speaker 0>For some reason, it keeps trying to open it with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 0>an old version of Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now this should work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,99]}

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.900
<v Speaker 0>So we don't have time to look at this in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 0>very much detail just now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.620 --> 00:44:01.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, but, um, okay, so what this is doing, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,54,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 0>Oh, actually, also, in fact, I'm just going to leave

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 0>that because it's got things in that I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:05.860
<v Speaker 0>introduce slowly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm really sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, I wasn't actually expecting to get onto that one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.020
<v Speaker 0>so I haven't prepared it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.470
<v Speaker 0>But let's go on to the to the questions and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,91,87,63,99]}

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.110
<v Speaker 0>see if we can get any sensible questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.470
<v Speaker 0>No questions at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.550
<v Speaker 0>Nobody's got any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:29.710
<v Speaker 0>Favourite biscuits?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.550
<v Speaker 0>My favourite biscuits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 0>I love rich tea biscuits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 0>I'm really like low key in my biscuit things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:36.670
<v Speaker 0>And also, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 0>Also I like biscotti.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 0>They're really good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:40.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.990
<v Speaker 0>Isn't nesting ifs a bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100]}

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:45.470
<v Speaker 0>Isn't it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,51]}

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.950
<v Speaker 0>Oh, God.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.310
<v Speaker 0>What is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,72,100]}

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.350
<v Speaker 0>Is it a bad practice?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,95]}

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.270
<v Speaker 0>We're going to look at alternatives to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:51.230
<v Speaker 0>So as you can see, even with the four options

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.390
<v Speaker 0>it does begin to get a little bit cluttered, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.070
<v Speaker 0>So sometimes it's um if you're in a complex situation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.270
<v Speaker 0>there are other ways to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.830
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to look at it differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 0>Look at that later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 0>Why do arrays start from zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.870
<v Speaker 0>I don't know a lot of things in coding start

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:05.270
<v Speaker 0>from zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 0>I've never really understood it, but that's how it works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:11.090
<v Speaker 0>Could you have used a break instead of nested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61]}

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:11.330
<v Speaker 0>Else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.610
<v Speaker 0>You could have used a break.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, usually you need to be a bit careful about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.410
<v Speaker 0>using breaks because it takes it right out of the

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.770
<v Speaker 0>coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 0>But yeah, that could have worked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.890
<v Speaker 0>Which is more efficient?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay, wait, this is a list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,84,100,100]}

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.730
<v Speaker 0>It might not jump around a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:28.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.810

<v Speaker 0>Yes.
