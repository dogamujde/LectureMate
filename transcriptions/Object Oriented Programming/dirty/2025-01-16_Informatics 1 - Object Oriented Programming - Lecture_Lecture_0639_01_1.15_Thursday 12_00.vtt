00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 0>Maybe not necessarily, but it's.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.680
<v Speaker 0>I can't emphasise enough that what you're doing in this

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 0>And if you do that by just getting ChatGPT to

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.200
<v Speaker 0>do it and not learning it yourself or whatever it

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.640

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.240
<v Speaker 0>So please take this seriously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 0>You have to develop these skills and if you just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 0>don't do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 0>No, that's for later in the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.900
<v Speaker 0>So we did awkwardly stop right in the middle last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.740
<v Speaker 0>time I was not expecting to get to the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.100
<v Speaker 0>of all of the contents of the first lecture, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.220
<v Speaker 0>we have to do all the admin stuff, but I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 0>wasn't really intending to stop in the middle of a

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 0>sentence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
<v Speaker 0>But anyway, we're now what we're going to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 0>What's the time?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.180
<v Speaker 0>20 pass okay, that gives us plenty of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 0>We're going to finish the first lecture, and then we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.460
<v Speaker 0>going to move on to loops that we're doing that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 0>we're planning to do in the second lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.660
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember what we got to I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 0>this is where we got to, we were looking at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 0>string concatenation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.300
<v Speaker 0>So we're looking at how you can use the plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 0>sign to do integer addition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95]}

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.860
<v Speaker 0>But also if you if you use a plus sign

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 0>and you're passing in strings, it's going to interpret the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 0>plus sign as string concatenation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if we mix this up a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.740
<v Speaker 0>bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.660
<v Speaker 0>Let's say uh is that you double O.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,68,100,100,97,90,74]}

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to put in an integer here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 0>So we've got an integer between two strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.390
<v Speaker 0>So this string here and this string is telling this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 0>plus symbol that telling Java Plus should be interpreted interpreted

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.230
<v Speaker 0>as string concatenation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 0>But here we have an integer which is saying you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.470
<v Speaker 0>have to interpret this as integer addition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 0>So what is IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 0>What's Java going to do with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.670
<v Speaker 0>So if we run it we see that that works

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 0>fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 0>So what is happening here is that Java is recognising

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 0>this as an integer, but is trying to do something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.590
<v Speaker 0>that's incompatible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 0>You can't you can't have plus being both integer addition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 0>and string concatenation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.350
<v Speaker 0>So what will Java will do in certain kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.430
<v Speaker 0>specific situations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.630
<v Speaker 0>It'll try to be helpful by seeing what is possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.870
<v Speaker 0>Now it's always possible to turn pretty much anything into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 0>a string just by putting quotation marks around it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.590
<v Speaker 0>At least that's what it looks like to us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.150
<v Speaker 0>It's not what's happening under the hood, but you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 0>turn things into strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.110
<v Speaker 0>You can't obviously turn strings into integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.470
<v Speaker 0>So it's just turning this into a string and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 0>doing string concatenation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 0>But by the way, what would happen if we took

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.560
<v Speaker 0>these zeros out and put them in here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.000
<v Speaker 0>What's going to happen here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.840
<v Speaker 0>So if we run that, we see the two zeros

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.080
<v Speaker 0>are dropped, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 0>And this is because Java's first looking in this as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 0>an integer and 007 as an integer is the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.440
<v Speaker 0>as seven is most easily expressed as seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Speaker 0>And that's why it's returning it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.920
<v Speaker 0>So it's dealing with an integer and then turning it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.680
<v Speaker 0>into a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.840
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if you put this in a string, obviously Java's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 0>not looking inside the string to see what that means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.320
<v Speaker 0>It's just treating it as a whole thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:19.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 0>So let's move on to variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 0>Let me just get the oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.600
<v Speaker 0>Let me I should not be up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,95,95,100,100]}

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 0>Get rid of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.520
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.800
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what can I do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,92,92,100]}

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.600
<v Speaker 0>Let me do a full screen mode.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,44,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now we're going to look at the basic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.220
<v Speaker 0>definitions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.740
<v Speaker 0>The structure of Java code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to go back to look at numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 0>And this time we're going to be printing out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 0>So what we've all we've been looking at so far

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 0>is just print statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 0>It's not doing anything other than printing stuff out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.740
<v Speaker 0>In fact I think that's what we got to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,89]}

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.220
<v Speaker 0>So now we're going to look at variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:08.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.340
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to have an integer variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:11.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 0>So let's think of an integer value for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.860
<v Speaker 0>What value should we give a three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.500
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to have b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 0>What value are we going to be 17.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,100,100,100,81]}

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.580
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:23.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.140
<v Speaker 0>We didn't do this on Monday did we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 0>No no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,97]}

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Just make sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,82,98]}

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 0>Then what we're going to print out here is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.260
<v Speaker 0>plus B right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 0>So the print statement is now taking in data that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100]}

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.300
<v Speaker 0>coming further higher up in the program and doing something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.740
<v Speaker 0>with it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 0>So you can see there's this red appearing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.260
<v Speaker 0>What happens if you have red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 0>We'll try and run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.750
<v Speaker 0>It's not going to run.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 0>If you have red in your program, you can't run

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 0>And here you can see the name of the file

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.110
<v Speaker 0>is underlined in red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,98,100]}

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 0>That means something really bad is wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.670
<v Speaker 0>We can't run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.550
<v Speaker 0>So what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.510
<v Speaker 0>What is the problem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.630
<v Speaker 0>So IntelliJ has lots of really useful ways of finding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 0>out what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 0>So wherever there's a problem, there's a little bar next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 0>to it on the right hand side of the screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.030
<v Speaker 0>And you can hover over that and it'll tell you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.230
<v Speaker 0>So this is saying cannot resolve symbol A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.910
<v Speaker 0>This is also what it's saying down here when I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 0>try and run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 0>And if I look up here I've got lots of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 0>problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.910
<v Speaker 0>And again if I click on that it'll show me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 0>what these are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 0>So the problem is that it can't resolve the symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,85,100]}

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.910
<v Speaker 0>What that means is that Java is saying I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 0>know what A is, what is a right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.990
<v Speaker 0>So in some languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.510
<v Speaker 0>So we can see here we've told that A is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 0>equal to three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.270
<v Speaker 0>Now some languages would say well three is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.510
<v Speaker 0>And I'm saying that a is equal to three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.750
<v Speaker 0>So a must be an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.310
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.270
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to tell it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.430
<v Speaker 0>It's just going to assume it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.030
<v Speaker 0>Java does not do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 0>Java likes everything to be very neat and very clear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 0>and very explicit and it will force you to tell

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.240
<v Speaker 0>it right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84]}

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 0>So I have to tell Java before I introduce a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 0>I have to say before I try and give a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.760
<v Speaker 0>value to it, I have to say what what a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.040
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 0>So I just put a B here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,52,100]}

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 0>And what this is saying is I'm introducing two variables

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.880
<v Speaker 0>and their names and their they're called a and b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,52,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Speaker 0>and they're both integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 0>That's their type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 0>They're both of type integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.320
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm going to assign a value to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 0>So say if I wanted to assign it like the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 0>string three, it's not going to like this because it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 0>was like well you have told me that a is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,58,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.200
<v Speaker 0>an integer and now you're giving it a value of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.520
<v Speaker 0>a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.840
<v Speaker 0>That's not that's not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 0>Integers kind of values that are strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.360
<v Speaker 0>So Java really cares about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.640
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's kind of mixed views about whether this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 0>is a good thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 0>It's kind of easier when you don't have to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 0>this explicit declaration, and you can just make assumptions based

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.440
<v Speaker 0>on what you assign things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,82,100]}

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.760
<v Speaker 0>But doing this all explicitly, it keeps you right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.120
<v Speaker 0>It makes it more difficult to it's more difficult to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 0>make mistakes, and it's easier to understand things when you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.600
<v Speaker 0>come and look at it later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.860
<v Speaker 0>So there's pros and cons to doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.180
<v Speaker 0>But in Java you have to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 0>There's two different ways of declaring things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 0>You can declare them right at the beginning or at

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.700

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.300
<v Speaker 0>Or you can do what we call we can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.100
<v Speaker 0>You can declare it as you introduce it, and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.540
<v Speaker 0>can do this all on the same line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 0>And we're saying, here's a and it's got this value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 0>And oh, by the way it's an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.180
<v Speaker 0>So you can do either way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:04.860
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 0>And then if we run that it's going to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 0>the addition for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.300
<v Speaker 0>So just a bit of oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.940
<v Speaker 0>And we all also can say instead of doing a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.020
<v Speaker 0>plus B in the print statement, which is kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.380
<v Speaker 0>always fixing us to, that's going to be the one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:22.860
<v Speaker 0>we're looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.140
<v Speaker 0>We can have C in here, another variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.580
<v Speaker 0>And we can say C is a plus B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 0>And usually usually you don't want to do too much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 0>in print statements because it makes it more difficult to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 0>follow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 0>It's usually useful to do it here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.380
<v Speaker 0>And again we have to initialise a c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,48,100]}

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say that's also an integer okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.430
<v Speaker 0>So this is an assignment statement here, where you're declaring

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 0>a variable and you're assigning a value to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 0>That's an assignment statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.790
<v Speaker 0>These here 17 and three are what we call literals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.030
<v Speaker 0>And that means they're specific values that you're assigning to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.030
<v Speaker 0>variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 0>And these things are variables which means as you probably

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 0>all know they can take on different values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:01.830
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.829
<v Speaker 0>And here is all this in slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.510
<v Speaker 0>So you know that okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.790
<v Speaker 0>And then there's other ways we can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.630
<v Speaker 0>So we had a look at Hello World where we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 0>were doing it in the print statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.589
<v Speaker 0>But equally we can just say we're going to print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 0>out a message.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.550
<v Speaker 0>And here we're going to say message is hello world

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.750
<v Speaker 0>And again it's not happy because I haven't told it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.829
<v Speaker 0>The type of message.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 0>What's the type of message string okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.670
<v Speaker 0>So string is capitalised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.990
<v Speaker 0>Integer is not capitalised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 0>We'll get on in a little while to why that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.550
<v Speaker 0>For now don't worry about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.510
<v Speaker 0>And this is an advantage because then we can print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 0>out whatever we like right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 0>So we can send in different values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 0>different values for message, and it'll print it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if we just say hello, world, that's all that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.000
<v Speaker 0>ever going to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.720
<v Speaker 0>So built in data types very important in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 0>So there's quite a lot of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.640
<v Speaker 0>These are the ones you'll be using most often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 0>So characters are individual letters or symbols.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 0>Individual symbols I guess which can be letters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.200
<v Speaker 0>They can be blank space can be dollar signs and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.960
<v Speaker 0>that sort of stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.640
<v Speaker 0>These are done in Java with single quotation marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.440
<v Speaker 0>Strings are sequences of characters and they're done with double

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 0>quotation marks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.960
<v Speaker 0>Integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.960
<v Speaker 0>You know, integers are whole numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, then floating point numbers are their type is double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.400
<v Speaker 0>This is kind of I always find this quite annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 0>This is a hangover from the old days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.080
<v Speaker 0>So the basic, uh, the so double has you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.600
<v Speaker 0>have bigger numbers than double, and the basic one is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 0>float.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 0>And it used to be back in the day, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.220
<v Speaker 0>memory was a real issue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 0>You really don't want to use up a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.460
<v Speaker 0>memory because machines don't have a lot of memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 0>So you would only use float.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.180
<v Speaker 0>And then if you had a really big if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.980
<v Speaker 0>really needed to, you'd use double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 0>And that means it's got double the storage space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 0>So you can get a double as much data into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.140
<v Speaker 0>a double as you can in float.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.900
<v Speaker 0>Nowadays, no one cares about memory at that level because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.980
<v Speaker 0>we've got way more memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.300
<v Speaker 0>So nobody ever uses float.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.180
<v Speaker 0>You just use double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.540
<v Speaker 0>But if you're wondering why is it called double?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 0>That's what it means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.780
<v Speaker 0>So it's just decimal numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 0>Boolean is also something you'll use a lot, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.740
<v Speaker 0>truth values whether something is true or not okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,52,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 0>So integer operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,40]}

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 0>So we've had a look at plus but everything else

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.220
<v Speaker 0>works in a way you'd expect minus multiplication division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.300
<v Speaker 0>So we looked at integers division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 0>There's no fractional part in integer integer division because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.780
<v Speaker 0>only dealing with integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.060
<v Speaker 0>Integers can't have parts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 0>But if you're doing it with doubles of course doubles

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.300
<v Speaker 0>have decimal parts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 0>And so it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 0>You get the exact response rather than rounded up to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 0>the nearest whole number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 0>The remainder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.150
<v Speaker 0>We didn't look at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.710
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.750
<v Speaker 0>So we did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.790
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.270
<v Speaker 0>What do we do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 0>Let's say int a equals five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.790
<v Speaker 0>Int b equals two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.510
<v Speaker 0>In c equals a divided by b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.390
<v Speaker 0>Spaces in something that looks nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,68,100,100,100]}

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to print out c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.630
<v Speaker 0>So that gives us two because five divided by two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.550
<v Speaker 0>is 2.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.670
<v Speaker 0>And the integer part of that is two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 0>And then this is the remainder operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.550
<v Speaker 0>And a five remainder two is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 0>If you remember your math that's because if you divide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.270
<v Speaker 0>it, if you keep dividing by two essentially two times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 0>two is four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.510
<v Speaker 0>And then there's there's one remainder between 5 and 4.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.230
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully that makes sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what happens?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.920
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look if we change this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.800
<v Speaker 0>So we've said this is so we haven't told it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 0>It's institute division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,38]}

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.920
<v Speaker 0>It's interpreting it as integer division because all of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 0>components are integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if we make this instead of an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 0>integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 0>Let's make it a double okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.040
<v Speaker 0>So first of all it's not going to like that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 0>because I've told it that a is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.120
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm assigning a value that's not an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.080
<v Speaker 0>So I have to change the type of a double

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.440
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 0>Now it doesn't like this line because I'm saying c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 0>is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, but I'm doing I'm not doing integer division here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.760
<v Speaker 0>because I've got a double coming in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.000
<v Speaker 0>So that doesn't make sense either.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 0>So I can change this to double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.560
<v Speaker 0>And then when I do this division it'll tell me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 0>2.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.160
<v Speaker 0>So even though B is still an integer A it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.960
<v Speaker 0>got some of the data coming in is A is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.440
<v Speaker 0>a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.080
<v Speaker 0>So it will do double division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.400
<v Speaker 0>So the one of the principles in Java is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,50,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 0>it does not want to throw away data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.440
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 0>So it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,95]}

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 0>It never wants to convert a double into an integer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.820
<v Speaker 0>because you're losing data there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if you convert an integer into a double, that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.220
<v Speaker 0>You're not losing any data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.780
<v Speaker 0>You're not using any information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.900
<v Speaker 0>So it can just convert 2 to 2.0 and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.300
<v Speaker 0>do double division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.340
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.420
<v Speaker 0>That's a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.980
<v Speaker 0>So if this is an integer and I just put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 0>this in here, but I've told it that C is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.380
<v Speaker 0>a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 0>What's it going to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.780
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.820
<v Speaker 0>So this is kind of interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.420
<v Speaker 0>Actually what it does is it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.300
<v Speaker 0>It's being told here this is integer division because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.780
<v Speaker 0>not looking at C when it's doing the division it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.340
<v Speaker 0>evaluates on the right first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.260
<v Speaker 0>So it's got two integers coming in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.900
<v Speaker 0>It's doing integer division and the outcome is two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 0>But now I'm saying okay but C is actually a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96,100,100]}

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.260
<v Speaker 0>double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.580
<v Speaker 0>So it has to convert to an integer into a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 0>double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 0>And that is 2.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.940
<v Speaker 0>So information is being lost there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.180
<v Speaker 0>Well it's not being lost because these are both integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Speaker 0>But yeah that's what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.340
<v Speaker 0>It does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.670
<v Speaker 0>this evaluates this first and then it converts it to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.150
<v Speaker 0>a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,76]}

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.870
<v Speaker 0>Now, there are ways around here around this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,98,100]}

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.150
<v Speaker 0>So say we're going to go back to this being

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.950
<v Speaker 0>a double and we're going to make this an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 0>And it's really not happy about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Now generally if it's if it's complaining about stuff generally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 0>it has good principles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92]}

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 0>And if you're getting this you're like oh yeah, okay,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.310
<v Speaker 0>I am losing data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.270
<v Speaker 0>Thanks very much, Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to change that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes there are there is a reason why you

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 0>really want this to be an integer, maybe, or for

<v Speaker 0>whatever reason, you want to force it to be something

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.630
<v Speaker 0>that isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.590
<v Speaker 0>Naturally, you're allowed to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 0>This is called casting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.990
<v Speaker 0>So what you do here is you say, right, here's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.470
<v Speaker 0>this division, whatever it is, and I want this to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.270
<v Speaker 0>be an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.870
<v Speaker 0>I want an integer output for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.310
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.430
<v Speaker 0>So it's essentially saying do this division however you like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.270
<v Speaker 0>and then make this into an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.270
<v Speaker 0>And then I can assign it to something that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 0>an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 0>This is called casting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.370
<v Speaker 0>And if we do this it's going to give us

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.210
<v Speaker 0>an integer value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.090
<v Speaker 0>It's going to give us two.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.370
<v Speaker 0>Even though A is a double it's throwing away that

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.130
<v Speaker 0>data because I'm explicitly telling it that that's what I

<v Speaker 0>You won't come across as all this often, all that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.610
<v Speaker 0>So you need to know what this is about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.450
<v Speaker 0>You have it on the right hand side to say

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.690
<v Speaker 0>to do the casting before you do the assignment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.210
<v Speaker 0>So we've done the remainder to go back to all

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.250
<v Speaker 0>these integer operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.570
<v Speaker 0>Of course, if you divide by zero that's a runtime

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.770
<v Speaker 0>error because it's not possible to divide by zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 0>So how you organise these things are there is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100,30,100,100,100]}

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Speaker 0>precedence that Java uses is just the same as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 0>normal mathematical way you do preference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:24.130
<v Speaker 0>However, I would strongly recommend against working out precedents and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:24.850
<v Speaker 0>doing it that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 0>Put things in brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 0>If you want things to happen first, put them in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.530
<v Speaker 0>brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.130
<v Speaker 0>Whether or not it would do that automatically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.460
<v Speaker 0>Because if you use brackets to clearly show which bits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 0>go together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.700
<v Speaker 0>It's so much easier to read.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 0>It's much easier to know what you're intending to do,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 0>but it will work without using brackets if you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 0>the precedent right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100]}

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.260
<v Speaker 0>So what I would do here is I would put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.780

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.860
<v Speaker 0>show you do the three times first first, three times

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 0>five first and then you minus two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.060
<v Speaker 0>It knows that anyway because that's that's bonus.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 0>And you don't have to be thinking about this when

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.380
<v Speaker 0>you're trying to interpret it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 0>Oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.060
<v Speaker 0>We've got some practice, some examples here.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 0>The double I've mentioned that here are some expressions.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I don't think we need to go through those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,97,82,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.740
<v Speaker 0>right now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 0>So we talked a little bit about converting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.300
<v Speaker 0>This happens automatically if you're not losing precision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.460
<v Speaker 0>Or it can always convert anything into a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.420
<v Speaker 0>And you can explicitly cast it if you want it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.980
<v Speaker 0>to be something that is naturally not.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.220
<v Speaker 0>So here we're rounding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.670
<v Speaker 0>So this is an example of If we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 0>round a decimal number to an integer and we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.470
<v Speaker 0>cast that to an int.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 0>So if you want uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,99]}

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.270
<v Speaker 0>So if you want a floating point result from the

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 0>division, you have to make at least one of the

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.630

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100]}

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.190
<v Speaker 0>And it will happen anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92]}

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.950
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96]}

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.470
<v Speaker 0>So let's just practice a little bit of that.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Whereas we've gone this is we can just think about

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.950

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to be an integer coming out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.210
<v Speaker 0>Uh what about number two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.050
<v Speaker 0>The same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.490
<v Speaker 0>Two instances going in instead of coming out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,98,98,100,100]}

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.530
<v Speaker 0>But we're then casting it to a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 0>So correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.330
<v Speaker 0>That will be a double uh, five divided by 2.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.650
<v Speaker 0>One of the things coming in is a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to have a double coming out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.130
<v Speaker 0>And here we've got the remainder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Speaker 0>These are both integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.490
<v Speaker 0>So this is an integer operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.530
<v Speaker 0>And also it doesn't really make any sense for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 0>remainder to have a two to be a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,62,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.330
<v Speaker 0>Uh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:19.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.690
<v Speaker 0>So what is the output.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.130
<v Speaker 0>This is C we've got the character C and we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,97,98,100]}

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 0>multiplying it by ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.810
<v Speaker 0>What is the outcome of that going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so most people, almost everyone is saying for type

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,97,100]}

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.580
<v Speaker 0>mismatch error, okay, that is not the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.940
<v Speaker 0>That is definitely the the one you should guess.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.060
<v Speaker 0>If you don't know what's going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.740
<v Speaker 0>This is completely non-intuitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 0>But just to show you what's happening here, let's try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.460
<v Speaker 0>this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's just do it in the print statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.460
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to do C character times ten okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.140
<v Speaker 0>And what is that going to provide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 0>It's going to provide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So the answer to C times ten is 990 okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.940
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have any idea what's going on there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.220
<v Speaker 0>And it's multiplying that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,99,92,40]}

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.300
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.100
<v Speaker 0>So this is about Ascii which I actually had up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.820
<v Speaker 0>in the last lecture and I don't have up now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 0>So ask you for those of you who don't know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.260
<v Speaker 0>this is basically a way of assigning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.030
<v Speaker 0>So every character has a numerical Miracle value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 0>So here you can see it's lowercase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,40,86]}

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.910
<v Speaker 0>See this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[28,98]}

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Speaker 0>This value in Ascii is 99.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 0>So what Java is doing here is it's saying oh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.390
<v Speaker 0>I know that all characters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.790
<v Speaker 0>There is a way to convert those into integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.430
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just going to be helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.470
<v Speaker 0>I see that this is possible with that conversion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.670
<v Speaker 0>So it's converting this into an integer and then multiplying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 0>it by another integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.150
<v Speaker 0>So the outcome is actually going to be an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:55.870
<v Speaker 0>That's a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.950
<v Speaker 0>That's actually something quite useful that you're going to use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.550
<v Speaker 0>later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.310
<v Speaker 0>But if you don't already know that you would never

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.870
<v Speaker 0>guess that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,99]}

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.550
<v Speaker 0>000 okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37,99]}

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.950
<v Speaker 0>Right on the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.550

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.290

<v Speaker 0>into characters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.650
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to cast this to a character because

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.690

<v Speaker 0>We're dividing all this by all this thing, and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.340
<v Speaker 0>we're doing a bit of multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.100
<v Speaker 0>So where is that going to leave us at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.340
<v Speaker 0>end?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 0>What kind of type is that going to lead to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 0>Most people are saying double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:44.980
<v Speaker 0>That is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.580
<v Speaker 0>All of this is integer integer operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.540
<v Speaker 0>Then we convert x to an integer and this becomes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 0>integer division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 0>Then we're multiplying it by a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.420
<v Speaker 0>So that means that this final operation up around here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,75,100]}

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.940
<v Speaker 0>is going to be interpreted as a double opera, as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 0>an operation for doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 0>Let's just see this quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100]}

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.380
<v Speaker 0>This is going to be an integer right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.940
<v Speaker 0>Because this is all integer stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.020
<v Speaker 0>Then we're then we're casting it to a double and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,61,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.660
<v Speaker 0>then we're recasting the double to an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.780
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to end up with an integer okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 0>Oh yes that's fine I'm going to leave this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.100
<v Speaker 0>So this is for questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.540
<v Speaker 0>You can start putting questions in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.510
<v Speaker 0>But what I'm going to do now is I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:32.550
<v Speaker 0>to go on to the next thing, which is loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 0>Actually, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.750
<v Speaker 0>Let me just look at this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 0>So is there anything I want to say about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.030
<v Speaker 0>So to go back to the very introductory stuff, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 0>Java is imperative is a list of statements essentially that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.390
<v Speaker 0>goes step by steps and it's based on objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,65,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 0>Objects carry state and they have behaviour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,68]}

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.110
<v Speaker 0>And a lot of what we're going to do on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.990
<v Speaker 0>this course is try and get your head around what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.630
<v Speaker 0>that means to be object oriented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 0>Actually, in the first weeks, what we're doing is mostly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.430
<v Speaker 0>the basic structural stuff and not too much about objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.950
<v Speaker 0>And then we get onto the object orientation stuff later

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.230
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.830
<v Speaker 0>Some people find object orientation quite hard to get their

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.190
<v Speaker 0>head around initially, but after a while you'll get very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 0>used to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.150
<v Speaker 0>You have to have this main, main method in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 0>class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think everything else we've just been doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 0>So you can look over that summary if you want,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.230
<v Speaker 0>but I think that's all covered.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.030
<v Speaker 0>So now what we're going to look or look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49,100,100]}

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.770
<v Speaker 0>is conditionals and loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.930
<v Speaker 0>This is very, very basic structures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.050
<v Speaker 0>If you've done any coding, you've done much coding before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 0>This will be very, very familiar to you if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:31.850
<v Speaker 0>haven't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 0>This is really important stuff to get your head around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 0>And nothing is happening in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 0>That's particularly different to happening in other languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 0>The same kind of general ideas apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 0>So the control flow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.810
<v Speaker 0>So we've already said it's imperative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 0>That means you do one statement and then another and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.490
<v Speaker 0>then another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 0>All in steps okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.330
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes these these steps that you do are not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 0>just simply do this and then move on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.730
<v Speaker 0>They're more uh, there's more stuff going on, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 0>what happens with conditionals and loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.130
<v Speaker 0>So this allows us to choreograph control flow so you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.610
<v Speaker 0>can go around do things more than once.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.850
<v Speaker 0>You can do things under certain conditions and do different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.770
<v Speaker 0>things under other conditions and so forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.370
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.170
<v Speaker 0>So let's go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.530
<v Speaker 0>Let's do an if statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.170
<v Speaker 0>Where are my notes for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:14.490
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 0>Let's get rid of all of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.690
<v Speaker 0>We don't need this anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.250
<v Speaker 0>So we're just going to start off by saying very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 0>simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 0>If an if statement starts off with a condition that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 0>you're checking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 0>So if X is less than y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 0>Then we open the curly braces and we say what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:33.940
<v Speaker 0>we want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.820
<v Speaker 0>If x is less than y, we're just going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.580
<v Speaker 0>print out that this is the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:45.540
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say y is bigger than x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:45.900
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh I forgot my plus here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.020
<v Speaker 0>I've got to tell a way to join this number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.820
<v Speaker 0>to this string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.300
<v Speaker 0>So I've got to have my plus there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.540
<v Speaker 0>And it's not very happy because I'm using x and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 0>Y and I haven't declared them.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to say x and y are integers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:00.460
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 0>This is getting a little bit out of sync because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.580
<v Speaker 0>of I've chopping about okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,75,100,100,100]}

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.700
<v Speaker 0>Now let's see what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.860
<v Speaker 0>Oh what's the problem here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.419
<v Speaker 0>Oh the problem here is I'm trying to get it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 0>to say whether two integers are bigger or not, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.980
<v Speaker 0>I haven't told them what value those integers have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.700
<v Speaker 0>So let's put some values in here actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.260
<v Speaker 0>So instead of doing that I'll do x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 0>What is it x equal Then ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,99,100,79,99]}

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 0>And why is 27 cool?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,94]}

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now I'm getting a yellow thing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.480
<v Speaker 0>And the yellow thing, what is the yellow thing saying?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.480
<v Speaker 0>It says condition X less than y is always true,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:37.679
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.800
<v Speaker 0>So I've given it fixed values for x and y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.480
<v Speaker 0>And then I put in some code to see which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 0>one is bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,85,100]}

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.159
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.240
<v Speaker 0>I don't need to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.399
<v Speaker 0>I can see which one is bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,94,100]}

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.280
<v Speaker 0>This is fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.000
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.320
<v Speaker 0>So normally when you're doing this you wouldn't be fixing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 0>these values before you're checking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.919
<v Speaker 0>These would be changing in different places or you'd be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:53.919
<v Speaker 0>passing them in right now I'm just going to fix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.919
<v Speaker 0>them in here because I'm just showing the for the

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.399
<v Speaker 0>loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 0>So let's run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.920
<v Speaker 0>So if it's got yellow objections it means it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 0>going to run it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.880
<v Speaker 0>But it doesn't think it's that well written.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 0>If it's got red objections it's not going to run

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.400
<v Speaker 0>okay 27 is bigger than ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 0>Awesome okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.480
<v Speaker 0>What happens if x is bigger X is now 30.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.920
<v Speaker 0>What happens is nothing, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.840
<v Speaker 0>Because I've just said if this is true then print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 0>something out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.640
<v Speaker 0>That's it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.680
<v Speaker 0>If it's not true, I haven't said what to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.490
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing for it to do if this isn't true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.490
<v Speaker 0>So often that's what we want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 0>Only do something under one condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 0>And if that condition is not true, do nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.970
<v Speaker 0>But quite often we want to say if something is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,76]}

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 0>true, do a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100]}

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.290
<v Speaker 0>And if it's not true, do be right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,97]}

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.370
<v Speaker 0>So what are we going to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 0>If it is not true, then we're going to say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.250
<v Speaker 0>else we're going to print this out the other way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.730
<v Speaker 0>around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.410
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to have X is bigger than Y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 0>So now if we run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 0>It's going to print out 30 is bigger than 27.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.770
<v Speaker 0>So whichever way around we're going to get the print.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 0>We're going to get it to print out something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.690
<v Speaker 0>That's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 0>We haven't actually looked at the case where they're both

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.530
<v Speaker 0>the same, but we won't be worrying about that right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:02.770
<v Speaker 0>now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100]}

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.690
<v Speaker 0>So that is a bit oh my goodness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,96,100,100,100]}

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:10.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, by the way, people, I do tend to get

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.130

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.660
<v Speaker 0>If you if you spam the QA thing with nonsense.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.300
<v Speaker 0>I can't actually see any actual questions in there, so

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.940
<v Speaker 0>I would recommend not doing that too much.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:31.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.900
<v Speaker 0>So this is all just stating what's true.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 0>As usual, I will do this in live coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.540
<v Speaker 0>I think that's more useful, but the slides are there

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is all exactly what we've done before.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 0>So looking at some examples of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.300

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.740
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise return minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 0>This is an if statement you might want to put

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.020
<v Speaker 0>know whether you're going to have it positive or negative.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.460
<v Speaker 0>What this one is doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.260
<v Speaker 0>Again, this would be really familiar if you've done some

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.020

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.500
<v Speaker 0>You're swapping the values around.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, this this this is basic error checking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.200
<v Speaker 0>So this isn't probably usually the way you'd want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.920
<v Speaker 0>do error checking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.440
<v Speaker 0>We'll we'll do error checking in a later lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 0>But it is sometimes quite useful to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.520
<v Speaker 0>So say for example you're doing division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.240
<v Speaker 0>And you know that you don't know what's going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Speaker 0>come in, but you know that it might be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what you can do, you can check whether it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 0>is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 0>And then if it is, you don't try and do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.360
<v Speaker 0>the division.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.240
<v Speaker 0>You just do something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.160
<v Speaker 0>Maybe just print out an error message or something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 0>And if it because you don't want the whole program

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.440
<v Speaker 0>to break, you want you want to pick up that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.080
<v Speaker 0>up sensibly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.440
<v Speaker 0>So an if statement is one way that you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.320
<v Speaker 0>want to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.600
<v Speaker 0>So loops loops uh things keep on happening again and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
<v Speaker 0>again and again until a certain thing happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 0>So let's program a while loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.600
<v Speaker 0>So we'll get rid of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 0>So while so in while loops and for for loops

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.200
<v Speaker 0>which we'll get into in a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.730
<v Speaker 0>You generally you have an iterator and that the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.690
<v Speaker 0>of an iterator is it's counting how many times you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.850
<v Speaker 0>been through the loop, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86]}

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 0>And the iterator is usually just called.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.890
<v Speaker 0>I, um, and with a while loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,48,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:27.930
<v Speaker 0>There's lots of ways you can do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.770
<v Speaker 0>We're very common to say, well, whilst the iterator is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.090
<v Speaker 0>less than a certain number, i.e. once a number of,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,76,98,100,100]}

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.850
<v Speaker 0>as long as the number of times you've been through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.730
<v Speaker 0>a loop is less than the total number of times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 0>you want to go through the loop, you keep going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.690
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say whilst AI is less than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,69,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.370
<v Speaker 0>or equal to n, so n is some number we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:44.850
<v Speaker 0>will give it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 0>Then we do some stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.890
<v Speaker 0>Now of course, as always we have to initially initially

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,79]}

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 0>initialise this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.690
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say I is an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,65,100,100]}

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 0>And you would normally want to start the iterator at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:54.330
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 0>How many times have you already been through the loop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.730
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 0>So that's standard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100]}

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.970
<v Speaker 0>Although in some circumstances you might want to do something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 0>different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 0>And how many times do you want to go through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.050
<v Speaker 0>the loop?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 0>This can be anything you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.490
<v Speaker 0>How many times do we want to go through our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 0>loop?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:08.370
<v Speaker 0>Ten times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:09.290
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.770
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to go through we're going to keep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 0>going through until we've gone through ten times okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 0>So what we're going to do is we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.020
<v Speaker 0>do some, uh, we're going to do multiples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 0>We're going to print out all the powers of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 0>That's what we're going to do this time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Speaker 0>So we need to be carrying data over between loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.020
<v Speaker 0>So we need to have something that is contained as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,67]}

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.940
<v Speaker 0>carrying the value of where we are so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to call this val val is an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.020
<v Speaker 0>integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 0>And what's it going to start at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:38.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500
<v Speaker 0>What would be a good starting value for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91]}

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.900
<v Speaker 0>So sometimes you want that to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 0>But we're doing powers of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 0>Obviously if we're multiplying something that's starting a zero by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100]}

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.580
<v Speaker 0>two we're never going to get anywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 0>So because it's multiplication we want it to start at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.260
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.260
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to print out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.380
<v Speaker 0>Um we're going to print out how many times we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 0>gone through the loop and the current value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.900
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to put a string in there with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.020
<v Speaker 0>just a space so that these aren't smushed together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.020
<v Speaker 0>It'll be much easier to read.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 0>This is where we are so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 0>So that's what we're doing in the loop, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.060
<v Speaker 0>So if we just run that, what's it going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.380
<v Speaker 0>do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.200
<v Speaker 0>It's just going to keep going forever and it's going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.640
<v Speaker 0>to print out I0 and value is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.080
<v Speaker 0>These are just initial initial values because we're not actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.760
<v Speaker 0>doing anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 0>So of course we have to do the the sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.800
<v Speaker 0>So we need a new value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.480
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to say value equals value times two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.920
<v Speaker 0>So again if you're used to coding reading the statement

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.320
<v Speaker 0>is probably quite clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.520
<v Speaker 0>If you're not used to this way of doing things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 0>that might look kind of weird right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.080
<v Speaker 0>Because this is in maths we're used to this used

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.960
<v Speaker 0>to this being an equal sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.000
<v Speaker 0>And what this is saying is something is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.000
<v Speaker 0>twice itself, which makes no sense okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 0>But that is not what it's doing in Java or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.360
<v Speaker 0>commonly in coding languages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 0>What this is doing is assigning values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.800
<v Speaker 0>So as we saw before with the instant division, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.600
<v Speaker 0>first of all evaluate the right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.280
<v Speaker 0>So what this is doing is saying right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.560
<v Speaker 0>First of all evaluate this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.320
<v Speaker 0>What is val.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.840
<v Speaker 0>Val is whatever we've got to so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680
<v Speaker 0>So on the first round time round it's just going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.520
<v Speaker 0>to be one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.400
<v Speaker 0>We're going to get this value from from wherever from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 0>where it's stored the current value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.010
<v Speaker 0>We're going to multiply it by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.130
<v Speaker 0>So in the first loop that's going to give us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.770
<v Speaker 0>a value of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.370
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to give that value to whatever's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Speaker 0>on the left hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.050
<v Speaker 0>So the fact that these are the same it doesn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.330
<v Speaker 0>matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.930
<v Speaker 0>They look the same, but they're actually not quite the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.930
<v Speaker 0>same because this is in the first time round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.970
<v Speaker 0>And this is after we've done the operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:32.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.930
<v Speaker 0>This will become really, really familiar to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.210
<v Speaker 0>It's a bit non-intuitive to begin with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 0>So there we're changing the value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.970
<v Speaker 0>And now we have to let it know we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.050
<v Speaker 0>to change the iterator because we're going through the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 0>We've been through the loop in extra time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.570
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say the iterator is now I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 0>equals I plus one right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87]}

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.170
<v Speaker 0>Just add one to wherever we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.290
<v Speaker 0>And now let's run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.570
<v Speaker 0>And this is doing exactly what we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 0>Here are this is how many times we've been around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,82,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,61]}

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.810
<v Speaker 0>And here are all the powers of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:03.210
<v Speaker 0>Awesome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 0>And actually, because iteration is so common, there's a shortcut

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.450
<v Speaker 0>you don't have to put I equals I plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.450
<v Speaker 0>You can just put I plus plus it means exactly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,65,65,100,100,100]}

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.540
<v Speaker 0>And that will do exactly the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.020
<v Speaker 0>Now what would happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 0>So we've got these curly brackets here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:21.580
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.020
<v Speaker 0>What happens if we take this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.660
<v Speaker 0>Let's run that and see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50]}

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.660
<v Speaker 0>Have a think what you think might happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:32.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.740
<v Speaker 0>So what is going to happen is what happened before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 0>we put any of this other code in?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.780
<v Speaker 0>It's just printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.860
<v Speaker 0>It's doing the first line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 0>And the reason for that is that in Java, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.460
<v Speaker 0>you don't have the curly braces, it just assumes that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 0>the first line is the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.260
<v Speaker 0>Everything else is outside the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 0>So it's interpreting this as if it's like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 0>Now if you're used to something like Python, you might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 0>be used to languages where indentation is actually meaningful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 0>And the language will say, well, look, this is all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.300 --> 00:42:59.820
<v Speaker 0>indented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.380
<v Speaker 0>So this is clearly all part of the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 0>That spacing is important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 0>It's not in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.300
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't care about the indentation at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 0>The indentation is not there for the interpretation by the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:10.380
<v Speaker 0>machine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.320
<v Speaker 0>The indentation is there to make it human readable, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.960
<v Speaker 0>it's easy for us to see what the loop is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.680
<v Speaker 0>But Java does not care about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 0>So you have to put in these curly braces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.760
<v Speaker 0>And that's again this is the same sort of thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.760
<v Speaker 0>It's Java's much more much stricter than other languages, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,98,51,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.640
<v Speaker 0>is kind of annoying but also potentially quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 0>So we'll quickly go on to four and then we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,57,57,97,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.640
<v Speaker 0>going to stop for some questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.440
<v Speaker 0>There's a couple more things I want to do about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.040
<v Speaker 0>loops, but we can fit those in on the Monday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.520
<v Speaker 0>lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.040
<v Speaker 0>But before loop let's look at the structure of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.400
<v Speaker 0>for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:42.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.720
<v Speaker 0>So a for loop is a little bit different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.760
<v Speaker 0>Now a for loop has a more complicated header but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.680
<v Speaker 0>makes things a bit simpler in other ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.880
<v Speaker 0>So first of all we initialise we we initialise the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.720
<v Speaker 0>iterator within the loop right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88]}

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.560
<v Speaker 0>So we start off with this into I equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.040
<v Speaker 0>That means we don't have to do it here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 0>Then we say what we would have in the while

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:04.960
<v Speaker 0>loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.920
<v Speaker 0>How long are we doing it for I less than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 0>or equal to n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.080
<v Speaker 0>And then the third thing is how are we going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.290
<v Speaker 0>to change it on each loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:11.930
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.810
<v Speaker 0>I++.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.850
<v Speaker 0>And then obviously we don't also want to do that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.570
<v Speaker 0>within the loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.570
<v Speaker 0>And if we run that we should see that's giving

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:20.610
<v Speaker 0>us exactly the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 0>So essentially the difference between a for loop and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.290
<v Speaker 0>while loop is that the for loop is tidying these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 0>things up a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.450
<v Speaker 0>It's putting it all in the header.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.370
<v Speaker 0>And it's clearer and more difficult to make mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.210
<v Speaker 0>So if you can use a for loop and don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.010
<v Speaker 0>use a while loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.850
<v Speaker 0>Does anybody know when you might not be able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:37.090
<v Speaker 0>do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:38.690
<v Speaker 0>And you might need to use a while loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:41.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.050
<v Speaker 0>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:44.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:45.370
<v Speaker 0>When it's indefinite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.610
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.570
<v Speaker 0>So here I know how many times I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:47.930
<v Speaker 0>go around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80]}

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.130
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:49.850
<v Speaker 0>I need to go around n times I can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:51.530
<v Speaker 0>this n times so I can put this in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.010
<v Speaker 0>Um and so in the previous while loop, we didn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.730
<v Speaker 0>need that to be a while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.250
<v Speaker 0>It could be a for loop, but sometimes we don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.090
<v Speaker 0>actually don't know how many times we're going to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.090 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 0>around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.850
<v Speaker 0>Could we put the umbrella up when it starts raining?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 0>I don't know when that's going to happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.410
<v Speaker 0>Or something can happen, you know, as soon as 20

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 0>people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:07.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.220
<v Speaker 0>As soon as soon as something happens, there's Is unpredictable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.420
<v Speaker 0>Then you do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.740
<v Speaker 0>Then you can't use a for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.460
<v Speaker 0>You use a while loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.820
<v Speaker 0>But if you know how many times you're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 0>go round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,46]}

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.180
<v Speaker 0>Use a for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's the main things I want to cover

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:19.940
<v Speaker 0>I will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.540
<v Speaker 0>There's, as I said, a couple of examples of that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.220
<v Speaker 0>that we'll do on on on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.020
<v Speaker 0>But let me just see if I can get anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.020
<v Speaker 0>useful out of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.740
<v Speaker 0>I don't think there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76]}

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.780
<v Speaker 0>Are there any useful questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:34.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.540
<v Speaker 0>If you have a useful question, put your hand up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.540
<v Speaker 0>I will go through all of the questions and see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.420
<v Speaker 0>if there are sensible things and email people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 0>Squid game.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.460
<v Speaker 0>Oh my god, who's watching Squid Game?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.180
<v Speaker 0>I've just I watched the first episode and then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.460
<v Speaker 0>was like, oh God, I don't I don't know if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.540
<v Speaker 0>I've got the strength to watch this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,92,52]}

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 0>I'm now on the second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.100
<v Speaker 0>It's so good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.460
<v Speaker 0>But it's it's so bleak.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 0>Why do we learn Java and not machine codes?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,95]}

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.620
<v Speaker 0>I mean, machine code is really, really difficult because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 0>completely unintuitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.380
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to know machine code anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.420
<v Speaker 0>So go and learn machine code if you want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.020
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:08.420
<v Speaker 0>Fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.680
<v Speaker 0>But it's not necessary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 0>And it's really difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100]}

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.040
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.520
<v Speaker 0>I think it's easier if I just, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:21.760
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.560
<v Speaker 0>Where can we find the PowerPoint slides?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.640
<v Speaker 0>So this is actually a useful question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.760
<v Speaker 0>So the PowerPoint slides where I go through the where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.920
<v Speaker 0>all the content is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Those are on open course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.200
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.960
<v Speaker 0>So have I got open course up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:36.920
<v Speaker 0>Here we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.520
<v Speaker 0>Open course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.840
<v Speaker 0>So if you go to schedule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.640
<v Speaker 0>So this is the the schedule is the overview telling
