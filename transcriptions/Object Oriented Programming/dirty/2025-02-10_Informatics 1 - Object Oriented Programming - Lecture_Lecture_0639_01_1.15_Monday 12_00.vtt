NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 0>I'm trying to and I've said this before, but I

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.590

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.320

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.600

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 0>Which is very much correlated to how, you know, whether

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.280

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100]}

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.200
<v Speaker 0>But it's not necessarily the same because you might have

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.840

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.600

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.200

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 0>It's not reflection, a reflection of how much potential you

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.800

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100]}

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.080
<v Speaker 0>But, um, anyway, uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 0>How difficult is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 0>So manageable is nearly 50%, which is great.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.880

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.760

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.880

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 0>That's probably because you've covered very similar material.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.930

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.470
<v Speaker 0>How you have groups of things that you're working through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 0>So we've already looked at one kind of collection, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 0>is an array, but now we're going to look a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.590
<v Speaker 0>little beyond that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100]}

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Speaker 0>So arrays are pretty useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 0>You've been doing quite a lot of things with arrays,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 0>but as you already know, as we've talked about before,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 0>arrays are limited.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 0>Arrays are quite rigid structures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 0>So you fix the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.910
<v Speaker 0>When you create an array, you fix the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 0>That is how it's stored in memory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 0>That is how much space you can store information about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 0>the array in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55]}

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 0>That's you forever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100]}

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.350
<v Speaker 0>That array is never going to change size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.990
<v Speaker 0>So that's which is often kind of annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, we know that arrays are part of Java language,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 0>and there's lots of special syntax and things built in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.070
<v Speaker 0>to help us work with arrays, but they're not always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.349
<v Speaker 0>optimal for handling data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 0>So another thing you can use and you will use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 0>quite a lot probably are array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 0>So array list essentially this is a sort of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,95,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 0>wrapper that the Java language puts around an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.510
<v Speaker 0>So under the hood you're still using arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.790
<v Speaker 0>But if you if you create them as array list

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 0>it gives you lots of options to do things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 0>might be useful, which are not things you can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 0>directly with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.480
<v Speaker 0>So one of the most important things is that they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 0>can grow and shrink as needed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to decide at creation time how big

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.240
<v Speaker 0>you want that to be in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240
<v Speaker 0>That sticks forever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, and also there are different methods for inserting and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 0>removing elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is how you declare an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.600
<v Speaker 0>It's very similar to how we always declare things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.920
<v Speaker 0>But you have these, um, angular brackets with the with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.880
<v Speaker 0>in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.720
<v Speaker 0>This is the type of thing that's going to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.680
<v Speaker 0>into an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,65]}

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 0>So like an array, everything in an array list has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 0>to be the same type of thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.520
<v Speaker 0>And you have to declare it when you create it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, you create a bit of memory as before, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.960
<v Speaker 0>as you see, you're not telling it how big this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.960
<v Speaker 0>You're just saying this is a new ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, so here the first example is with string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 0>And you might do this with with built in types

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 0>or standard types like strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 0>But very often you're going to be doing this with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.140
<v Speaker 0>objects you've created from classes that you've written.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 0>So an example I think we're going to go on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.780
<v Speaker 0>to this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 0>Not today, but later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, there's hotel room.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,24,100,100]}

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 0>There's a big coding example where we're creating hotel rooms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 0>and figuring stuff out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.420
<v Speaker 0>So you might want to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 0>And then you have a array of different hotel rooms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, you can do whatever you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.900
<v Speaker 0>The only limitation is that it cannot be a primitive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 0>type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.820
<v Speaker 0>You can't put integers or booleans in or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this this is just the way that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.300
<v Speaker 0>call it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 0>You have to have the empty bracket.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.340
<v Speaker 0>So this is essentially, um, showing what you're passing into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 0>that, but you don't need to pass anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 0>So we looked at calling methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.580
<v Speaker 0>There's a brackets afterwards which sometimes will have arguments in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,91,97,100,100,100,73,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 0>But even if you don't have arguments you have those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.900
<v Speaker 0>empty brackets in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.980
<v Speaker 0>That's the way you call it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, however, one useful thing in ArrayList, I don't know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 0>why this happens for this, but not for anything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 0>You know, normally we have this stupid thing Well, when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.990
<v Speaker 0>you create something new, you have to say what type

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.990
<v Speaker 0>it is, and then you have to say, oh, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.030
<v Speaker 0>thing I'm creating that is that thing is also the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.870
<v Speaker 0>same type as the thing that it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, but in ArrayList, you don't have to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35,43,58,38,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 0>You do have to say it's a list, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,80,60,48,100,100]}

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.430
<v Speaker 0>don't have to duplicate what you're saying here because it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 0>knows it's got to be strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 0>So you don't have to say that again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.670
<v Speaker 0>This is just something Java's been doing since for quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 0>a long time, since Java eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.870
<v Speaker 0>You can do it with ArrayList and in a way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,87,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 0>that you can't do with other things for some reasons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we're not passing it aside right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,82]}

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 0>When we create it, it doesn't have a size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 0>Therefore when we when we first construct it, it has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 0>size zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.190
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.150
<v Speaker 0>And then we add methods to it and we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.510
<v Speaker 0>remove if we want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.110
<v Speaker 0>And then the size is changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.830
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at that in IntelliJ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to create an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.270
<v Speaker 0>And here you can see this is a built in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 0>stuff ArrayList e where E is going to be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.080
<v Speaker 0>the type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 0>And here you can see it already knows that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.560
<v Speaker 0>need I'm going to want to access the built in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 0>methods in ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,90]}

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 0>So if we just go back to the um so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.040
<v Speaker 0>this is a Java API.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,100]}

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.200
<v Speaker 0>You can see there's all kinds of things that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,95]}

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.400
<v Speaker 0>might want to do in ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 0>So I want to import all that all that functionality

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.320
<v Speaker 0>when I'm doing the coding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.920
<v Speaker 0>But I don't really need to bother with that because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.840
<v Speaker 0>IntelliJ already knows that I want to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to create an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.240
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to contain strings I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.080
<v Speaker 0>call it cheers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94]}

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 0>And this is a new array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,67]}

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.320
<v Speaker 0>And here so you see it automatically puts those brackets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.680
<v Speaker 0>in because it knows that they're needed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Um but I can leave that empty if I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.160
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.960
<v Speaker 0>Or I could put string in as the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,30,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 0>So now I've got a new ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's have a look at what that looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.160
<v Speaker 0>So this is what it's going to print out right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 0>It is printing something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.220
<v Speaker 0>It's saying there is definitely something here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Speaker 0>And the square brackets indicate this is an ArrayList, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,84,100]}

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 0>there's nothing in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 0>It's empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 0>So let's start adding things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.900
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do that using the add functionality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 0>So I'm adding something to my array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,87]}

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 0>Cheers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.580
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to add a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.940
<v Speaker 0>It's got to be a string obviously because cheers is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.700
<v Speaker 0>an array of strings an array list of string strings

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.380
<v Speaker 0>I should say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to add hip twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,100]}

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.660
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 0>What.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.780
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.380
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to say hooray okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 0>Um and then I'm going to run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.380
<v Speaker 0>What's that going to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh it's not going to do anything because I'm printing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 0>it before I actually add anything to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Speaker 0>So let's move that down here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.860
<v Speaker 0>By the way, cutting and pasting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.630
<v Speaker 0>When you're coding, uh, you probably will do it quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 0>a lot, but do be really careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 0>It's really easy when you cut and paste to just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.390
<v Speaker 0>screw things up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now I print it out and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,63,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 0>what it looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.350
<v Speaker 0>It looks like an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.750
<v Speaker 0>Basically it's in square brackets and it's listing everything in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 0>there with commas between it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.510
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.030
<v Speaker 0>So there's various things I can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 0>So let's maybe find the index of a particular thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.990
<v Speaker 0>So if I do it I'm going to get index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to be I want the index

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.430
<v Speaker 0>of the string hip.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.630
<v Speaker 0>And I'm looking at that within.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 0>Cheers okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to print out index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.790
<v Speaker 0>So this is telling me that um hip is at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.990
<v Speaker 0>index zero right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.030
<v Speaker 0>So you see there's actually two hips in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 0>I print out the original thing as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, so why is it only telling me one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 0>So if we go back and have a look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.480
<v Speaker 0>the, um, Javadoc, what we're looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,95,100,89,100,100]}

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 0>Index of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.560
<v Speaker 0>I don't want the index of down here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,52,54,96,100,100,97,100]}

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.160
<v Speaker 0>I'm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37]}

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:01.840
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 0>I should have got this line up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,64,97,99,95,100]}

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.920
<v Speaker 0>Here we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.600
<v Speaker 0>Index of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,87]}

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.600
<v Speaker 0>So that's telling me it returns the first occurrence of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.920
<v Speaker 0>the specified element in the list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 0>So that is just how it's not inevitable that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.600
<v Speaker 0>is that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.520
<v Speaker 0>But that is how it's been written.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 0>So if you want to know how to do this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 0>you look at the API and you see what it's

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 0>giving you and what it's giving you is the first

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.440

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 0>So let's add another thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.800
<v Speaker 0>Let's add here another thing saying hop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.120
<v Speaker 0>So if I actually let's bring this down here which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.520
<v Speaker 0>is ad hoc.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,80]}

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.120
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what that looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:44.980
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 0>So you can see actually we've already seen this as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.100
<v Speaker 0>we're building up hip hip hooray.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 0>But if you do add what is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 0>Where does it put it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.380
<v Speaker 0>It's going to put it at the end of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:52.900
<v Speaker 0>array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,75]}

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.460
<v Speaker 0>So you're adding always adding to the back of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.100
<v Speaker 0>array list if you just simply use add.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 0>But we can do this differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 0>So we can say actually um, so Add is going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.620
<v Speaker 0>to have more than one way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 0>This is an overloaded term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.180
<v Speaker 0>It's got more ways of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.420
<v Speaker 0>Whereas add so here add with no um added just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,98,61,100]}

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.700
<v Speaker 0>with the element will amend it to the end of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 0>the list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.900
<v Speaker 0>But also we can give it an index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.580
<v Speaker 0>And if we give it an index, that's not going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 0>to put it at the end of the list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 0>It's going to put it at the index that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 0>specify.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.300
<v Speaker 0>So let's say here we're going to add uh it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50,90]}

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:33.980
<v Speaker 0>index one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.220
<v Speaker 0>And then we have a look at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.140
<v Speaker 0>So then it goes in at index one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 0>And it pushes everything else further down the array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.500
<v Speaker 0>And the array list is getting bigger as we do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:41.860
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we can also do things like check whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 0>things are there, which is quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Speaker 0>So there is a uh, a function called contains, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 0>let's call it is in, uh, cheers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.630
<v Speaker 0>But if we say hap uh oops I don't want

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.230
<v Speaker 0>to debug it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.150
<v Speaker 0>It's going to say false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.350
<v Speaker 0>So that contains is just looking for not how many

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.750

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.400

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.400

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and the other thing is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.380
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, I should have mentioned this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.700
<v Speaker 0>You've obviously seen this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 0>This is another really nice thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 0>Beyond that, you can't do with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.220
<v Speaker 0>You can see here I'm just saying print this array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.430
<v Speaker 0>list and it just prints it in a sensible, manageable

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.630
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.350
<v Speaker 0>As we know with arrays, you can't do that or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,35,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.550
<v Speaker 0>raise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.750
<v Speaker 0>You either have to go through the for loop and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.590
<v Speaker 0>print everything separately, or you have to do the two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.630
<v Speaker 0>string methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68]}

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.230
<v Speaker 0>But here you can just print it in a sensible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.390
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.310
<v Speaker 0>So there's lots of things in here that you really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 0>want arrays to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100]}

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100]}

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:01.390
<v Speaker 0>So I can do let's do um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.470
<v Speaker 0>So we can, we can do for loops, we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.910
<v Speaker 0>loop through ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64]}

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Speaker 0>So let's say for now we're going to do an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.270
<v Speaker 0>enhanced for loop because we don't need the index in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.550
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say for um s in cheers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,92]}

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 0>So for everything that's inches every item and s we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 0>need to say is a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.070
<v Speaker 0>Also S is a terrible name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.230
<v Speaker 0>Let's say for word in cheers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,64]}

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 0>What we want to do is we're going to just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.870
<v Speaker 0>print out the index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.790
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to print out the index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.470
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's been so difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,95,99,100,100]}

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, word plus has index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.640
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.880
<v Speaker 0>Oh why is it keep doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,94,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.240
<v Speaker 0>Um now I'm going to get the index of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.200
<v Speaker 0>Um word and I'm going to print that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.800
<v Speaker 0>That should work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.960
<v Speaker 0>Let's just get rid of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.280
<v Speaker 0>And if I haven't accidentally got rid of too many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 0>brackets, I should work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 0>And also, let's just print out the line here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.760
<v Speaker 0>We don't want a blank line there okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,71]}

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 0>So just a little reminder of enhanced for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.080
<v Speaker 0>We are going through something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.880
<v Speaker 0>This isn't the case as an ArrayList, but we've done

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,68,97,100,100,70,100,100,100]}

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.520
<v Speaker 0>this with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 0>And for everything that's in that container we're doing this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.640
<v Speaker 0>particular thing which is printing out that that item and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.360
<v Speaker 0>its index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100]}

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.200
<v Speaker 0>So here you can see um hyp has index zero,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 0>hoppers index one, Hyp has index zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.540
<v Speaker 0>So in the second place, we're now on to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,61,100]}

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.340
<v Speaker 0>second tip.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 0>But it's still telling us that it's at index zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,78,100,100]}

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:43.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.980
<v Speaker 0>That is because this is kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.500
<v Speaker 0>So it's just this is just looking for a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.220
<v Speaker 0>It's not looking for this particular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 0>Well it is looking for a string that exactly matches

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.220
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.420
<v Speaker 0>But it's not looking for the string particularly in that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 0>index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.980
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to go to the whole array and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.660
<v Speaker 0>it's going to find the first instance of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 0>Even though you're in a loop that's going through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.180
<v Speaker 0>array one by one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:06.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.980
<v Speaker 0>So this is just something you need to be a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.820
<v Speaker 0>little bit careful of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.100
<v Speaker 0>Make sure you understand that these things are happening when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:17.340
<v Speaker 0>you're doing these these manipulations, these methods within for loops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 0>Just be really conscious of how it's working and think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 0>about whether it's actually working on the particular item you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.220
<v Speaker 0>looking at or whether it's looking at the whole collection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:27.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 0>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 0>So we could have done that with a standard for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,97]}

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.110
<v Speaker 0>loop, but easier because we're not using.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.070
<v Speaker 0>We're only using the iterator to, to to do each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 0>individual thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.270
<v Speaker 0>We're not using it as a counter or anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,83,100]}

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.550
<v Speaker 0>Then we can just do the enhanced for loop, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 0>is easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we've looked at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.750
<v Speaker 0>So now remember I said that ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.310
<v Speaker 0>You can't use primitive types.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 0>You can't have an array list of ints.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, but maybe sometimes you want to have an array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.670
<v Speaker 0>list of int.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 0>So what do you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.550
<v Speaker 0>Well we've looked at this before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.990
<v Speaker 0>We have these wrapper classes, which is essentially just a

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.150
<v Speaker 0>way of turning, uh, primitive types into objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.990
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to worry about this too much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.910
<v Speaker 0>You just need to know that this is this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.310
<v Speaker 0>the thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100]}

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 0>If you want to put primitive types in places where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.630
<v Speaker 0>primitive types don't go, you just use this conversion and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.630
<v Speaker 0>it's super easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 0>And usually it just means you turn the first letter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.190
<v Speaker 0>to A from lowercase to uppercase, sometimes it's into integer,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 0>etc..

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, and you don't you don't need to do anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 0>about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.910
<v Speaker 0>So here I'm saying this is 2.75.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.510
<v Speaker 0>That is a double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 0>That is a primitive type with a lowercase d.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.290
<v Speaker 0>That is what its type is.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 0>But I'm saying, actually, I want you to consider this

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 0>to be an object double, not a primitive type.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm indicating that to Java with the capital letter.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 0>I can just do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.770
<v Speaker 0>And likewise the other way around, I've said that battery

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.730
<v Speaker 0>to treat this thing X which I'm making.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 0>You can just switch between these as you like.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 0>And you do this so that it's just a little

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.970

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.490
<v Speaker 0>So uh, most of the time, or maybe not most

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.170
<v Speaker 0>I ought to keep an eye on the time anyway.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so here what I'm doing is I'm creating

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.330

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm making something that I'm calling circle here.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 0>I'm constructing that, and I'm going to put my thing,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.820

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.500
<v Speaker 0>So an array list contain anything you like.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.700
<v Speaker 0>Very often this will be your own objects.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.220
<v Speaker 0>Some functionality will not work properly unless you implement the

<v Speaker 0>necessary interfaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:52.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 0>I actually maybe should have removed that because I don't

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.140
<v Speaker 0>want you to think about that later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.700
<v Speaker 0>Until later, we'll go through this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but just be aware that it does get a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.900
<v Speaker 0>little bit more complicated, and we'll look at that in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.500
<v Speaker 0>more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:02.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at nested array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 0>And so you can um, this can get arbitrarily complicated

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.060
<v Speaker 0>which is always fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.900
<v Speaker 0>Obviously good principle of coding, which I talk about all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.220
<v Speaker 0>the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 0>Don't make it too complex.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.900
<v Speaker 0>So you can have an array list like 1020 deep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 0>Don't do that because it'll be impossible to understand and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.180
<v Speaker 0>really difficult to work with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:29.100
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes, um, uh, sometimes, um, having a list of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,90,90,100]}

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.660
<v Speaker 0>array list can be quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.220
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.990
<v Speaker 0>We're going to do something about the weather.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.950
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to make an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,55]}

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.670
<v Speaker 0>And this is what's going to be in my array

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:41.110
<v Speaker 0>list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.630
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.550
<v Speaker 0>This is an array list of array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,99]}

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.510
<v Speaker 0>And these array lists are going to be a type

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 0>double okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.190
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to be a new array list.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.270
<v Speaker 0>Array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 0>Is that right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 0>Or am I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,44,44]}

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.630
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.270
<v Speaker 0>Come on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,99,86]}

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.630
<v Speaker 0>I think all my brackets are working.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:03.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 0>So now I'm going to see what does this actually

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.350
<v Speaker 0>look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.870
<v Speaker 0>Now because I'm doing things with arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 0>When I'm when I'm auto completing from system, it's thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 0>That's why it keeps filling it with things from arrays

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 0>when actually I'm trying to get it to print.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.590
<v Speaker 0>So that's why that happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.310
<v Speaker 0>And this is oh wait, this doesn't have a name.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.570
<v Speaker 0>Because probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 0>I think it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99]}

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.770

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.490
<v Speaker 0>It's created this for me, and but it's empty, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.730
<v Speaker 0>there's nothing in it so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.690
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Speaker 0>Now I want to add something to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.090
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to add the first thing I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 0>to add is a new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.690
<v Speaker 0>There's no I've told it this is a ArrayList of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 0>ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.850
<v Speaker 0>But there are no ArrayList in there because I haven't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,29,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.530
<v Speaker 0>added any.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.730
<v Speaker 0>So now I can add an ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.410
<v Speaker 0>So daily tempered and uh it's going to be a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.490
<v Speaker 0>new ArrayList of type double.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:25.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.130
<v Speaker 0>So what is this going to look like okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.420
<v Speaker 0>So now you see there is an ArrayList in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 0>So now I have an ArrayList containing one ArrayList and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 0>that internal ArrayList has nothing in it, but it exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 0>And obviously if I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 0>Then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 0>If I tried to add something that wasn't an ArrayList,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.100
<v Speaker 0>um, it's not going to like it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:46.660
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 0>So incompatible types obviously, because I've said although there's nothing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.060
<v Speaker 0>in it, I've said it's going to be an ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.380
<v Speaker 0>So that's what it's expecting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:58.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 0>So now I can start adding things to my ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 0>Uh but how do I do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.980
<v Speaker 0>So if I just do if I just say right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.740
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to add some temperatures, I'm going to add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 0>temperature.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.980
<v Speaker 0>What's the temperature today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.900
<v Speaker 0>About four degrees.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, but obviously I can't just do add 4.0 okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300
<v Speaker 0>Because it's not expecting doubles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.820
<v Speaker 0>It's expecting an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,65,64]}

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.900
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not putting this straight into daily temp.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.940
<v Speaker 0>I'm putting it into one of the array lists that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 0>exists in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.580
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to put it well there only is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,90]}

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 0>one that exists at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:33.070
<v Speaker 0>So I have to put, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 0>So I have to use the get command.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.470
<v Speaker 0>So if we, if we look back at what get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.350
<v Speaker 0>was actually doing, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.470
<v Speaker 0>So get returns the element at the specific position in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 0>the list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Speaker 0>So I need to think where do I want this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 0>to go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.030
<v Speaker 0>I need to get that element and I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.990
<v Speaker 0>change that element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.630
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to get zero the first the the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.790
<v Speaker 0>first thing in there I want you to get it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 0>And then I want to add 4.02 whatever comes back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.230
<v Speaker 0>from get zero, which will be, um, which will be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 0>the empty array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.910
<v Speaker 0>So if I print that I have to put the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.430
<v Speaker 0>print command in the right place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.190
<v Speaker 0>So it's printing it after it's done this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.270
<v Speaker 0>So now we can see 4.0 is in the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.590
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.710
<v Speaker 0>So I can add another array list to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100,100]}

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 0>If I want to I can add as many as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 0>I like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's add three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:27.650
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so now I've added three array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.610
<v Speaker 0>If I run that, you can see there's now three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.170
<v Speaker 0>elements of the top level array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 0>And one of them has got something in it and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 0>the others don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.690
<v Speaker 0>And I can do this exactly as I like for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.290
<v Speaker 0>any of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 0>I can say, all right, let's get let's add something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.490
<v Speaker 0>to the whatever's in second position.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 0>This is going to be 10.0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, and to the first one I want to add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.090
<v Speaker 0>another element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.210
<v Speaker 0>Let's say 3.7.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.570
<v Speaker 0>So now it's got three array lists and one the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 0>first has got two elements, the second has got zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.090
<v Speaker 0>still and the third has got one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 0>So we build it up in that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:20.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.570
<v Speaker 0>This is just a reminder.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.570
<v Speaker 0>We already looked at this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 0>You need to import the right the right information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's get rid of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.380
<v Speaker 0>We don't need these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 0>So, so these are these are actually things when I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,99]}

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.740
<v Speaker 0>was playing around with it before, I was using things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.700
<v Speaker 0>that needed arrays and hash maps, which are going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,88,54,60,80,37,100,100]}

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 0>get onto in a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,68,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 0>It's not using these anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 0>So the import statements are still there, but they're not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 0>doing anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 0>But IntelliJ has put in this import array list for

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.100
<v Speaker 0>me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.020
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise it wouldn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.540
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at a different kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.020
<v Speaker 0>array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,76]}

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.740
<v Speaker 0>This is going to be strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 0>So hang on I think I've got a different example

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.180
<v Speaker 0>for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 0>So now we've got an array list of strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.140
<v Speaker 0>Here's one I made earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 0>And this has got three three names in it Charles,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 0>Mary and Peter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 0>So what we've looked at so far is adding and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.100
<v Speaker 0>removing stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 0>But sometimes what you want to do is manipulate any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.140
<v Speaker 0>number of things in an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 0>So what I want to do at the moment is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.260
<v Speaker 0>I want to find any element in my array list

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:25.710
<v Speaker 0>that has the, uh, this string are within it, Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,68,100,100,100]}

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.030
<v Speaker 0>So I've got this is a string called indicator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.990
<v Speaker 0>And I've marked it final because I don't want people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.670
<v Speaker 0>changing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, and what I want to do is to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:41.270
<v Speaker 0>through and, um, to go through and what this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:41.630
<v Speaker 0>doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 0>What this is trying to say is that if, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 0>for every name in this array, if that name contains

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.070
<v Speaker 0>this indicator, then remove it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:50.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.710
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at what's going to happen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.230
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.230
<v Speaker 0>Don't want to debug.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100]}

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 0>I want to okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85]}

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.670
<v Speaker 0>So this is printing out this array list as we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.750
<v Speaker 0>looked at before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.350
<v Speaker 0>But then it's getting really upset with this concurrent modification

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 0>exception.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.630
<v Speaker 0>I don't actually even really know what that means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.590
<v Speaker 0>But what it means is you can't do that this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.910
<v Speaker 0>way with array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.150
<v Speaker 0>And this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 0>Oh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99]}

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.390
<v Speaker 0>So to do this you need iterators.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 0>And iterators are objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.170
<v Speaker 0>And they allow you to iterate through each element of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:25.850
<v Speaker 0>a collection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 0>So this is something you'll need to do quite a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 0>lot to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93]}

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.770
<v Speaker 0>You have to have an object that is going through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 0>So let's show how we would actually do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:33.770
<v Speaker 0>Let's get rid of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.330
<v Speaker 0>So comment that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.130
<v Speaker 0>And this which opened earlier is already commented.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 0>So let's uncomment this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:45.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.610
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm saying here is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm creating something that is an iterator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.890
<v Speaker 0>And this iterator is going to be a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:54.970
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be a string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.170
<v Speaker 0>Because what I'm trying to do here is find things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.770
<v Speaker 0>that have a particular string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 0>Uh, no, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100]}

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 0>That's completely not true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.050
<v Speaker 0>Forget I just said that it's of type string because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.850
<v Speaker 0>this is an array list of strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I'm using this iterator command.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.890
<v Speaker 0>We can again look at iterator in the API.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 0>Uh I don't know why is this not enough particular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,26]}

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.090
<v Speaker 0>order anyway I don't know where it is, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.940
<v Speaker 0>can have a look and see exactly what that's doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.860
<v Speaker 0>And I'm doing it on this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 0>Names is an array list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,99,99]}

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,92]}

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.260
<v Speaker 0>So while there is another element I'm going through until

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.580
<v Speaker 0>it's empty and I'm and I'm finding what is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.100
<v Speaker 0>next one, as long as there is a next one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.700
<v Speaker 0>I want to look at what that next one is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.740
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to make that temporarily name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 0>And then if it contains the indicator you remove that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,98,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.940
<v Speaker 0>So if I just show you how that works if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.780
<v Speaker 0>I just run that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 0>So this this is, this is originally printing it out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 0>and this is what it's printing out now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 0>It's just printing out Peter because Charles and Mary both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.340
<v Speaker 0>have the substring.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.340
<v Speaker 0>So they're being removed by that process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:02.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.540
<v Speaker 0>So the the kind of actual thing that does the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.100
<v Speaker 0>work is very similar to what we have in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.020
<v Speaker 0>for loop, but we don't do it with a for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 0>loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.740
<v Speaker 0>We have to do it with an iterator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:15.940
<v Speaker 0>For various reasons that are more complex than I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100]}

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 0>to get into at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.820
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, I don't know if I actually really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.780
<v Speaker 0>know myself either.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 0>That's how it works in Java.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.120
<v Speaker 0>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:22.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.520
<v Speaker 0>Associative arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.399
<v Speaker 0>Uh so one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.600
<v Speaker 0>So we know in array we have this index right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.800
<v Speaker 0>We have a unique index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 0>Everything has a key.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.679
<v Speaker 0>And that is a that's its index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,88,100]}

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:38.040
<v Speaker 0>Um but with regular arrays this is fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.679
<v Speaker 0>You start at zero and they're integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.760
<v Speaker 0>And that is how you associate things to their positions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, however, if you want you don't always want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.000
<v Speaker 0>do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.159
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.200
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you want to have keys that are not just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.760
<v Speaker 0>integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.879
<v Speaker 0>And you can do this with associative arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if you have a person's phone number,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:57.960
<v Speaker 0>you if you have a person's name, you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.000
<v Speaker 0>be able to look up their phone number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 0>So then you want the key to be the person's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.760
<v Speaker 0>name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.720
<v Speaker 0>It's not very helpful just to have an integer index

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.240
<v Speaker 0>for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.600
<v Speaker 0>And there's various different, um, things you might want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 0>do with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then you have this relationship between the key

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:11.800
<v Speaker 0>and the value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 0>You're mapping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 0>You're using mapping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.960
<v Speaker 0>And um, in general these are called associative arrays.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 0>But the way they're implemented in Java are hash maps

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.610
<v Speaker 0>So associative arrays in Java are hash maps type HashMap

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,87,100,100]}

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.810
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.130
<v Speaker 0>So for example you might want to map students to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.290
<v Speaker 0>their matric numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100]}

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 0>So the keys here are strings and the values are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.210
<v Speaker 0>also strings actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89]}

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 0>Um so you can do this if you want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.050
<v Speaker 0>Um here we're mapping words to their lengths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.730
<v Speaker 0>And you can see we've got more than one mapping

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Speaker 0>to the same values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.250
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 0>So keys can map to more than one value okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.210
<v Speaker 0>But keys themselves must be unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.850
<v Speaker 0>We can't have key with the same name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 0>That makes sense, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.210
<v Speaker 0>Because we use the keys to look things up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.890
<v Speaker 0>And if there's more than one, that's the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.770
<v Speaker 0>But that's not really a key.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.130
<v Speaker 0>You don't know which one you're looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 0>The key can only be mapped to one value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:11.050
<v Speaker 0>Is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.090
<v Speaker 0>So the key.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 0>So the keys themselves have to map to one value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 0>Keys cannot map to more than one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.380
<v Speaker 0>Because the key is what you're using to look it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,68]}

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:22.540
<v Speaker 0>up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.020
<v Speaker 0>It's got to be unique and it's got to map

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.980
<v Speaker 0>to something specific.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 0>Now that's fine if you want it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 0>If we want to know loads of information about pizza,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.340
<v Speaker 0>and we want this to point to lots of stuff,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 0>we can do that, but only by putting them in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 0>a collection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 0>We can put it in array for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.420
<v Speaker 0>So Peter would just be pointing to one thing that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 0>would be an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 0>And then within the array we might have lots of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 0>different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.060
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100]}

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to do this with hash maps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:46.380
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 0>What am I doing with the hash map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.860
<v Speaker 0>So we need to import Java util HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,99]}

00:36:59.500 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to make um let's go back to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.420
<v Speaker 0>the other one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.500
<v Speaker 0>Let's get rid of all of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to make a hash map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,98]}

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 2>So Mm mm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,99]}

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.440
<v Speaker 0>So HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.400
<v Speaker 0>And you can see there's capital the capital M.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,38,100,100,100,99]}

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.480
<v Speaker 0>It's helping me do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.720
<v Speaker 0>Uh string and int.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 0>As I've just been saying uh in in these collections

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.320
<v Speaker 0>you can't use primitive types that I was just typing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.120
<v Speaker 0>in int didn't like it because this is not valid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 0>I need to put integer instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.280
<v Speaker 0>So what am I doing here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.440
<v Speaker 0>I'm saying in my HashMap the the keys are going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 0>to be strings and the values are going to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 0>integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to be I'm going oh it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,64,99,100]}

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.200
<v Speaker 0>needs a name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 0>This is going to be word length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.840
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to be a new HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.280
<v Speaker 0>Uh of yeah that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.120
<v Speaker 0>So let's then have a look at what that looks

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 0>like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay, this is what a HashMap looks like that's got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.770
<v Speaker 0>curly braces instead of the square brackets that you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100]}

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.890

<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to have a sentence.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:05.690

<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.770
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to just put this in just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.610
<v Speaker 0>because then we've got a little bit of repetition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:21.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, Okay, so this is my string, and I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.820
<v Speaker 0>to use some built in a built in method called

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.380
<v Speaker 0>split.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.260
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to create words string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.340
<v Speaker 0>This is an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99]}

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.540
<v Speaker 0>So words is an array of strings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to split the sentence by spaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:37.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.260
<v Speaker 0>So um actually yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to use a sentence dot split.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 0>And then in here I'm going to put just a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 0>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:46.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.220
<v Speaker 0>So this means split this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 0>Every time you see a space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.020
<v Speaker 0>You're moving on to something new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 0>And then let's have a look at what that's going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.500
<v Speaker 0>to look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.900
<v Speaker 0>Uh, words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 0>Oh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,99]}

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:03.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 0>So what's gone wrong here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 0>Because I've forgotten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.660
<v Speaker 0>Because I was doing ArrayList and HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.820
<v Speaker 0>So you can just print out easily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.300
<v Speaker 0>But actually I've told it that words is an actual

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:11.580
<v Speaker 0>array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.540
<v Speaker 0>It's not an ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,87]}

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.060
<v Speaker 0>So I can't do simple printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.280
<v Speaker 0>I've got to do the array of two string methods.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,49,96,100,100]}

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.200
<v Speaker 0>And look, did you see how when I did that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.640
<v Speaker 0>let me just show you this again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is this is commented out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.400
<v Speaker 0>We don't need util arrays, but once I do this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 0>uh, to string, I'm using a two string method from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.080
<v Speaker 0>array, so it automatically knows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.280
<v Speaker 0>Actually now we do use it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.280
<v Speaker 0>And that's why that's now upgrade to show that this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.520
<v Speaker 0>is actually being used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.720
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and we're sending words to them okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.600
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to get rid of these commas because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 0>that's just making it harder to see what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 0>So this is what split does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.920
<v Speaker 0>It creates uh, it separates things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 0>Um, according to it creates an array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.160
<v Speaker 0>It turns a string into an array with each of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.040
<v Speaker 0>different elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.360
<v Speaker 0>And here I'm saying, uh, when you have a space,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 0>start with a new element I could put.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if I put like l, I want you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.000
<v Speaker 0>to split it on that instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.680
<v Speaker 0>This is what it would look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.600
<v Speaker 0>So it's splitting until when it comes to an L

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.450
<v Speaker 0>it's removing that and it's creating a new thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:16.770
<v Speaker 0>But I'm going to do space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.970
<v Speaker 0>So now I've got my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.130
<v Speaker 0>Now I've got my words and I am making this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.970
<v Speaker 0>hash map okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,80]}

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to say for I'm going to do an

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.370
<v Speaker 0>enhanced for loop for string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:35.770
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:41.890
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going through my array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 0>And for every uh element of that I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.770
<v Speaker 0>put things into my HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.650
<v Speaker 0>So my hash map is called word length okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,93,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to do word length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.450
<v Speaker 0>Dot put.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:57.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 0>So this is how you add things to a to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 0>a hash to a hash map.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.650
<v Speaker 0>And it's telling me here what needs to be in

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 0>here I need a key which has got to be

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.930
<v Speaker 0>a string.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.010
<v Speaker 0>an integer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 0>And it knows that because that's what I've told it,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.090
<v Speaker 0>that the HashMap word length is like.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.540
<v Speaker 0>so my key is going to be the word and

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.260
<v Speaker 0>word is.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.620
<v Speaker 0>So if I run that that should now print out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.220
<v Speaker 0>my HashMap okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 0>So you see before I did that the HashMap was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.580
<v Speaker 0>just empty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 0>But now I've been putting things into my HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.780
<v Speaker 0>I've been putting one thing in for every element of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.380
<v Speaker 0>this array.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.900
<v Speaker 0>And what it's doing here is telling me is telling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 0>me what's in there and what its key is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.260
<v Speaker 0>So the word love.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 0>So the word love is the key.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 0>Its value is four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,98]}

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:49.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 0>Because love is four words, four letters long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then you can, you can see each of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.780
<v Speaker 0>the values is how many how many letters are in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 0>there that's been calculated on the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.060
<v Speaker 0>Was another point you can see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.620
<v Speaker 0>So you can see there's a lot of repetition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 0>So again and laugh are both have values five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.820
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't matter but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.440
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:12.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.560
<v Speaker 0>So there's actually no repetition because, um, this is uppercase

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.360
<v Speaker 0>and that's lowercase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.960
<v Speaker 0>So let's make it lowercase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 0>Now we can see Liv is coming in twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 0>What's going to happen here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Because I've told you that keys have to be unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.880
<v Speaker 0>So what's it going to do with this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so live here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.960
<v Speaker 0>There's only one instance of it, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.520
<v Speaker 0>So it's starting off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.200
<v Speaker 0>When it's going through this it's going to find Liv

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:37.600
<v Speaker 0>live.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 0>Live has length four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68]}

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, but it's not coming up twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.640
<v Speaker 0>It's just removing the second instance of it because keys

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.600
<v Speaker 0>have to be unique, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.560
<v Speaker 0>So it's not going to put the same key in,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 0>um, when it already exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.280
<v Speaker 0>So that's what it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.480
<v Speaker 0>It'll just discount repetition if you're telling it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.200
<v Speaker 0>Those are keys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100]}

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 0>There's also hash tables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 0>There's a sort of you can think of them as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.600
<v Speaker 0>the same as hash maps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.040
<v Speaker 0>There are some subtle differences, but for now you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 0>think of hash tables as pretty much interchangeable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is exactly what we've already done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is our enhanced for loop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,94]}

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.050
<v Speaker 0>This is a different way of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 0>No, not a different way of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.890
<v Speaker 0>A different thing that you might want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:22.970
<v Speaker 0>So what's happening here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, here, we're getting the key set, and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.570
<v Speaker 0>the set of, of keys in word length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 0>So this is printing out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 0>So key set is just going to print out all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 0>the different keys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is what we've seen, but you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:42.410
<v Speaker 0>loop through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.730
<v Speaker 0>So what this is doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we were adding things to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.610
<v Speaker 0>So what you can do and there's lots of things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.170
<v Speaker 0>you could do, but you can, um, print out this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 0>is, um, looping over all the keys to print out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:53.810
<v Speaker 0>what they are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, and here we're using, remember the format, the print

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 0>f that we looked at last time?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.690
<v Speaker 0>We're formatting a string because we want to say this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 0>is going to be the key.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 0>And this is going to be the, uh, value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.170
<v Speaker 0>This is what we want the string to look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 0>And then we're filling in all these values for each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.580
<v Speaker 0>iteration.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 0>So if that's not familiar, have a bit of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.020
<v Speaker 0>play with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:21.100
<v Speaker 0>Looked back at the lecture, last lecture and printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 0>This is what we've just done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.100
<v Speaker 0>So you can print out hash maps very easily which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:25.900
<v Speaker 0>is nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, here you of course you can put your own

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.220
<v Speaker 0>data types into hash maps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.940
<v Speaker 0>So here what we're doing, we've created circles like we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 0>saw with the array lists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,41]}

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 0>But we want to put it into a hash hashmap

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.340
<v Speaker 0>because we want there to be um keys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.540
<v Speaker 0>So what we're doing here is we're creating a small

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.100
<v Speaker 0>the key the keys are the size basically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the key type of the key is, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,87,56,98,98,100]}

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.860
<v Speaker 0>string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.140
<v Speaker 0>And the type of the of the value is circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.820
<v Speaker 0>So in small we're putting this new circle which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 0>of size two etc. etc..

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.500
<v Speaker 0>We will touch a little bit later on that there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.860
<v Speaker 0>are certain restrictions about what you can use in keys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.640
<v Speaker 0>Most importantly you have to have a equals method.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.680
<v Speaker 0>So generally when you're defining things you will have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.000
<v Speaker 0>equals method anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.880
<v Speaker 0>But with keys that's compulsory because you want to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.760
<v Speaker 0>able to compare keys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.560
<v Speaker 0>So there must be a way of knowing if keys

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.400
<v Speaker 0>are equal or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 0>So you can only do things for which a equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.760
<v Speaker 0>method is defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 0>Here again we can write nested HashMap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.760
<v Speaker 0>So this is a HashMap where the the value is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760
<v Speaker 0>an ArrayList.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78]}

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 0>And here so we're saying there's large circles and there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.080
<v Speaker 0>small circles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.280
<v Speaker 0>But we don't want that to be only one large

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 0>circle and only one small circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.560
<v Speaker 0>But keys as we know have to point to one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.360
<v Speaker 0>specific value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.840
<v Speaker 0>So we can't have the keys small, pointing to lots

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.080
<v Speaker 0>of different circles that can only point to one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.840
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to get it to point not to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.880
<v Speaker 0>a circle, but to an array list of circles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 0>And in that array list, we can put all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.920
<v Speaker 0>the circles that we want to say are small.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.000
<v Speaker 0>And here you can see what this does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.040
<v Speaker 0>It circles are five and six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 0>They're small.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100]}

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 0>Large circles are 203 hundred.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.210
<v Speaker 0>And we can do that arbitrarily complex Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.610
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 0>Summary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.410
<v Speaker 0>So you use an array list when you want arrays

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,92,100,100,100,97]}

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 0>to be able to grow, or you want to use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 0>that nice built in functionality of easily adding and removing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.530
<v Speaker 0>and printing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, and you can move things around and it's, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.250
<v Speaker 0>it has a lot of advantages.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Um, HashMap when you want to have a key that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 0>is not just integers that you get with arrays and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:32.130
<v Speaker 0>ArrayList, you can look at the Java API.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, but importantly you need to have this iterator object

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 0>if you want to iterate through collections and do something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 0>to every, um, item in the collection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's all for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I will look at what's coming in and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.250
<v Speaker 0>we'll clap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34,21]}

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:56.450
<v Speaker 0>Um to a solution to the tutorials should be oh

00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 0>they should be on the um the solutions for tutorials

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.170

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 0>They should be on the course uh materials page.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.690
<v Speaker 0>I will have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 0>I'll get them put there.
