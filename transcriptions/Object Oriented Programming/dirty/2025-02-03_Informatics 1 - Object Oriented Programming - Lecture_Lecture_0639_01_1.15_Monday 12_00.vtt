00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 0>normal one B session.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100]}

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think I've talked a little bit about

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 0>why we're doing this, because what we're doing in first

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880

<v Speaker 0>in university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 0>And most of what that means is, is building up

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.760

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 0>But also really important part of that is building up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.120

<v Speaker 0>your career.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 0>So one thing we hear all the time from employers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 0>is that it's not that hard to find people with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 0>really good technical skills, but people who have really good

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 0>all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 0>The kind of interaction stuff is much more difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.410

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.650

<v Speaker 0>We're going to have lunch about halfway through.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 0>coming to the second one today, rather than the first

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 0>Obviously, if you have to go, there's a timetable clash

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,93]}

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 0>or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, but hopefully that will work out for most of

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 0>you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,90,98]}

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 0>So it's it's all about interaction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,97]}

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 0>So make sure you're sitting near people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 0>Uh, it's actually great if you're sitting near people that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 0>you don't hang out with all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.490
<v Speaker 0>But if you're sitting there, your pals, that's that's okay

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,68,100,100]}

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 0>as well, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91]}

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I haven't got any of the normal stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 0>I actually thought I maybe I should have brought part

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 0>of the lecture, but I haven't done that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so I will do double pat of the lecture

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,99,99,100,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 0>on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, I actually saw in some of the I'll go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 0>through the feedback as well from last week on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 0>I saw in the comments that somebody suggested we should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 0>do a pet of the lecture competition to see who's

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 0>got the best pair.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 0>I have to say I'm a bit dubious about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.429
<v Speaker 0>I think all pets are the best pair.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,98]}

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.429
<v Speaker 0>This is very subjective.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure I can encourage ranking of pets, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.990
<v Speaker 0>we'll see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 0>Maybe there's something fun we can do with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 0>But anyway, most of the time today adds a nice

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 0>change for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 0>Is not going to be me talking out to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,43,67,100]}

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be you talking amongst yourselves a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 0>But also the session is going to be led by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 0>Becca from careers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 0>So some of you probably already come across Becca.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 0>Becca is the person in careers who specialises in informatics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,69,100,100,100,100,73,100,100]}

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 0>So she you do drop in sessions and informatics and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,88,98,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 0>all sorts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 0>And she's specialised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,98]}

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 0>She's a strong word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 0>I mean she's a specialist in informatics career.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to go that far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 0>So yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 0>So Becca is going to be leading the session and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,52,100,100,100,88,88,100,100]}

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 0>we're ready to get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It is so lovely to come into a room full

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>of people this size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And you are actually all chatting to each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And part of that was probably those annoying and slightly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>weird slips that I gave you to talk about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>But I think partly it's probably because of the energy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080
<v Speaker 1>you bring into these sessions anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.400
<v Speaker 1>So awesome.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 1>stuff we're going to do today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got three activities that we're going to focus on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Will break for lunch in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Probably these things aren't going to mean very much yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start to tell you about them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:18.170
<v Speaker 1>So let's start by thinking about this idea of design

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:18.890
<v Speaker 1>thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So what do we actually mean when we talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>design thinking?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And to start there, we can think about different kinds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.050
<v Speaker 1>of thinking and the way that we might compare them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So we've got engineering thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Now engineers are often thinking, how can I build the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.890
<v Speaker 1>best version of this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>How can I build the strongest bridge or the fastest

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:38.730
<v Speaker 1>car?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 1>How can I solve my way forward by building stuff?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So we say that engineers think by a lot about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,90]}

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.850
<v Speaker 1>engineering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Thinking is about solving problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Business thinking is about optimising your way forward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's about thinking what are the levers that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.070
<v Speaker 1>can pull?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 1>What are the factors that will make my business more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 1>profitable or increase my customer base?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about those little incremental pieces to optimise my way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.030
<v Speaker 1>forward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Now, within research thinking, quite often people are analysing their

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>way forward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So they're about isolating variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.990
<v Speaker 1>What makes a difference?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>How can we understand how we can move our way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 1>forward?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And then what makes designers different is they are building

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.590
<v Speaker 1>their way forward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 1>So rather than analysing rather than optimising, rather than trying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.550
<v Speaker 1>to find the best possible option, what designers do is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>they do stuff and they see if it works and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.470
<v Speaker 1>then they do some other stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Any resonance, Fiona, between those four different kinds of thinking,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.550
<v Speaker 1>where would you put yourself?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 0>Mr. Tennyson.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,48]}

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I think that certainly when you're thinking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 0>coding, there's all kinds of combinations of these involved in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.000
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.400
<v Speaker 0>I mean, certainly it's all about engineering, but, um, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,73,100]}

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.560
<v Speaker 0>think, yeah, the idea of analysing where you are, where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,52,100,81,78,100]}

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 0>you're at, and I'm trying to talk about this a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Speaker 0>lot in the course, in the course of like when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100]}

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 0>things don't go wrong, it's when things don't go right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.240
<v Speaker 0>You have to think like strip it back and do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 0>that analysis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, but maybe the design thinking is stuff that we

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.360
<v Speaker 0>do less.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.640
<v Speaker 0>And probably for me personally, I guess I don't do

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 0>that as much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 0>I do a lot of research thinking and engineering thinking,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:26.720

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, yeah, I would agree.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.440
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm in a university setting and I'm trying to

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.280

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.720

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>How can we make more students come?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.240

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>rather than this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Just let's try it and see what happens and see

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.500
<v Speaker 1>what the result is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.580
<v Speaker 0>So that's what we're we're doing that a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.300
<v Speaker 0>now right with this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.180
<v Speaker 0>So we've we've used to run a lot of these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,49,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.900
<v Speaker 0>as separate events, standalone events.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 0>And it was really hard to get students to come.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.900
<v Speaker 0>And then we thought, well actually this is a fundamental

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.820
<v Speaker 0>part of what we want our students to be learning

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 0>in first year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 0>This is a core part of education, and so we

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.580
<v Speaker 0>ought to have it in a in a lecture context

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.380
<v Speaker 0>in your normal teaching rather than rather than separately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 0>So now we're seeing how it goes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.380
<v Speaker 0>So so far I'm pretty happy because there's a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 0>of people here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.140
<v Speaker 1>So what is design thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.500
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look really briefly at the way designers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.900
<v Speaker 1>work and the way designers think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to start looking at some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.620
<v Speaker 1>the tools that we can use to design our own

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.900
<v Speaker 1>lives, careers, time at university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So this process is probably one you're actually reasonably familiar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>with, if you think about it.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>If we start with this empathise step, if we're designing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.780
<v Speaker 1>something, we need to empathise with the people who are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.500
<v Speaker 1>going to use it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>So if I was going to make a new pair

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.790
<v Speaker 1>of trainers, I would want to start by saying, well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I need to understand what's going on for people who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.630
<v Speaker 1>buy trainers or people who wear trainers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.830
<v Speaker 1>What do they want from that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.030
<v Speaker 1>What are the problems with the trainers that they already

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 1>buy?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.750
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to design an app or a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.750
<v Speaker 1>game or a tool, I would want to think, well,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.430
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be using this and understand a lot

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>more about them in life design?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>The user is us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So actually we have to empathise with ourselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.070

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:16.110

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.590

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.750

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 1>We then move into that defined stage, and I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,64,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.390

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.390

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.230

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.070
<v Speaker 1>do here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And when we're thinking about our lives, IVs.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And we move into this ideation stage rather than jumping

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.370

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I think even a really good exercise regime would not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So I need to accept that and focus on something

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So today we're largely going to be having a look

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.340

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 1>So around empathising with ourselves and defining the problem.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing we want to do is start

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.060

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.180
<v Speaker 1>ways of working.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're the few that are going to

<v Speaker 1>collaboration.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Basically, the principle that the best idea for you could

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.590

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.430

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.390

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That that mindset of curiosity is probably quite self-explanatory, but

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really important going in and saying, how might I

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.150

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.230

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.070
<v Speaker 1>What would be interesting to me?

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And then that reframing, that idea of saying, what am

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.830

<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.590
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I want to say before we jump

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.490

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.010

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.310

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.590

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.710

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.650

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.370

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.610

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 1>This one at the bottom there they have a talk

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.860

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And we've got an example up here of, obviously, a

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.980

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.990
<v Speaker 1>helpful in choosing courses, but just anything that when you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>look back at your life, it feels meaningful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start a timer for this exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of personal reflection, so it's probably best

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.350
<v Speaker 1>to just give yourself the time to reflect on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Before we get going, does anyone have any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.070
<v Speaker 0>I've got a question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 0>Can you explain about the four different boxes with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 0>symbols?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So they should have labels as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.670
<v Speaker 1>So you can use these categorisations or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 1>But the Categorisations are helping you to think really broadly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.270
<v Speaker 1>about all aspects of your life.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So you've got one section there which is for play

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.470
<v Speaker 1>or fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.630
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that you've done which have been

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.150
<v Speaker 1>entertaining or interesting or fit into that kind of category?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You've got one section which is about work or study.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.550
<v Speaker 1>You've got one section which is about relationships or connections,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 1>or in the the book version they call love.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.230
<v Speaker 1>You can interpret that however however you wish, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.750
<v Speaker 1>about connections with people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another section which is about health and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 1>we mean mental, physical health.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Anything that for you fits into those kinds of categories.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It can be quite helpful to think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Can I get a few meaningful experiences in all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.130
<v Speaker 1>those boxes as a prompt to move forward?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.210
<v Speaker 1>But if all of your meaningful experiences are in one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.530
<v Speaker 1>box, that's fine too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.170
<v Speaker 1>So I will start a timer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Um, there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100]}

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I love this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100]}

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55]}

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.770
<v Speaker 1>So we're thinking about personal reflections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So fine to share with other people, but give yourself

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.290
<v Speaker 1>time to think about your own personal reflections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay, just remembering this bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,48,94,82]}

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.850
<v Speaker 0>You're mostly supposed to be reflecting on your own stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.730
<v Speaker 0>Not chatting too much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100]}

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.210
<v Speaker 0>There's going to be loads of time for chatting about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.530
<v Speaker 0>what you're thinking about later on, but right now, just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.370
<v Speaker 0>think on your own about yourself primarily, okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.090
<v Speaker 0>I only got another a minute and a half left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34,47,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Pop your pens down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.400
<v Speaker 1>How did you find that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I think obviously I walked around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,87]}

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.160
<v Speaker 1>There were lots of people having different ways to approach

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.600
<v Speaker 1>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Did anyone find that easy?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:20.900
<v Speaker 1>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 1>So nobody found that easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't suddenly that there were a list of instant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.060
<v Speaker 1>things that you considered to be memorable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 1>That came through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Anyone find it particularly hard?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.900
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to ask you to do now

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 1>is to go back to that list and to start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.620
<v Speaker 1>to add those experiences to the map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So on the back there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully by separating them out, rather than saying, well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.540
<v Speaker 1>just tell us what you've done, tell us what's happened

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 1>and thinking about those things chronologically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Just encouraging you to reflect on how those things fit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.460
<v Speaker 1>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So you can see on that printout at the back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you've got previous years, which can be as many or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.660
<v Speaker 1>as few as you want to include in that definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.460
<v Speaker 1>You've got last year and you've got this year if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to use the margins, if you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 1>use the notes page, then that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>But what I would like you to do is go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.430
<v Speaker 1>through those meaningful experiences and just plot them onto the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.750
<v Speaker 1>map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Where?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.510
<v Speaker 1>What happened when?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.830
<v Speaker 1>If you've got coloured pens, you could use that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.310
<v Speaker 1>But I'm guessing not many people have at this stage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.750
<v Speaker 1>And then as you're doing that, you might start to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 1>notice themes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Connections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Did did one meaningful experience lead to another?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.350
<v Speaker 1>What were the patterns that you can see?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So as you're adding those things chronologically, I just want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you to have in the back of your mind what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.070
<v Speaker 1>was going on here, what's important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And if you can identify things that happened deliberately or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.670
<v Speaker 1>things that happened kind of accidentally, then that might be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.590
<v Speaker 1>useful information to have as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.750
<v Speaker 1>So any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Most of the problems that you have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,69,100,78,100,97,81]}

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So I've got a couple of examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.390
<v Speaker 1>So you can do it in however make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,98,100]}

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So this is an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.600
<v Speaker 1>This is a second year mechanical engineering student who actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 1>gave us one of those examples at the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And he decided to put those things on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's drawn some different arrows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So actually he's used those colours.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And we've got this bit of a health thing going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.080
<v Speaker 1>on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like a broken leg in the middle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.200
<v Speaker 1>of first year or the middle of second year was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.480
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a health downer there as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.400
<v Speaker 1>We've got this development here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So who's talking about this talk we're talking about then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,71,84,100,100]}

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.400
<v Speaker 1>leading to mechanical engineering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And then he's talking about joining formula student and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.120
<v Speaker 1>kind of impact of that too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.320
<v Speaker 1>So you can leave this final column which is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.280
<v Speaker 1>what next column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to focus on that unless anything comes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:57.720
<v Speaker 1>up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But go back and have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a few more examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 1>So this person is just arranged them kind of thematically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And again, someone there, I think we must have had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 1>lots of pens on that day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So they put those together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Any other questions on that one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you three minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>This timer hasn't got music.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just a silent one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So as you're going think, do you like music?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll adjust a bit later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes to put things on your map chronologically and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 1>find the connections between them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Well, then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,92]}

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.140
<v Speaker 2>That's not very nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Wow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44]}

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,73]}

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Is that better or not working?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,62,100,72]}

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Won't be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,86]}

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I will time this one on my phone and give

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you updates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So, again, probably largely a personal reflection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Lots of chances to talk about it later, but give

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself a little bit of time to really think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.310
<v Speaker 1>what you've done in the past and what's meaningful for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 2>184.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,72]}

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.110
<v Speaker 2>It's more than I get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,71,71,100,100]}

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.710
<v Speaker 2>That is less than.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,97,95]}

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I just want to see it like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,61,100,94,77,66,60]}

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 1>One more minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Just to add to those meaningful experiences in chronological order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 1>And notice anything that's going on there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.300
<v Speaker 2>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32]}

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>What is that all about?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,96,99,90,79]}

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44]}

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40]}

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Before my phone beeps the time we're at us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,77,67,100,96]}

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.840
<v Speaker 1>End.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Damn it!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 1>There we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of that three minute process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Now, it was clear from across the room there were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.320
<v Speaker 1>some people for whom that felt a little bit weird

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 1>or a little bit uncomfortable anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's really interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.120
<v Speaker 1>But if I was going to give you a bit

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 1>of a thought about why it's worth doing that, it's

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.920
<v Speaker 1>worth thinking in detail about what you've done in the

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.480
<v Speaker 1>past.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's worth spending time on saying, how did that happen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Why did that happen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Are there things that you can reflect on?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Things that have gone really well, things that have gone

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.410
<v Speaker 1>that have been more challenging, that you want to explore

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:15.690
<v Speaker 1>or you want to take forward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And when we're thinking of that big question, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 1>why we're here today, which is how can you make

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the most of your time at university, then how you

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 1>made the most of your time before you came to

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.210
<v Speaker 1>university is going to be a really important factor there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Coming in and saying, well, what have I done before?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.970
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to do more of?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to do less of what's new

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.050
<v Speaker 1>and what's new and possible out there for me?

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.740

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.100
<v Speaker 1>creating new knowledge.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.100
<v Speaker 1>of the mind poster, which is going to be important

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The second of these archetypes is career readiness.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So is university.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 1>For the express purpose of helping you to develop skills,

<v Speaker 1>knowledges, knowledge, experiences that are going to enable you to

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.940

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.980
<v Speaker 1>The third of these is primarily about self actualisation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,97]}

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it about becoming you, understanding yourself, knowing what's important

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>to you, what you can do, your capabilities so it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 1>might give you opportunities to expand on some of those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.150
<v Speaker 1>other things that fit into the university experience, like travelling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.230
<v Speaker 1>or playing a sport.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.990
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth of those archetypes is that university is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 1>about supporting ourselves and our communities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.950
<v Speaker 1>So education is a key to social mobility, to building

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 1>better, more equal, innovative societies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And also in this category might be that actually I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.350
<v Speaker 1>coming here to study because I think that people depend

<v Speaker 1>on me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So those four archetypes, there are four posters in four

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:37.630
<v Speaker 1>corners of the room.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm going to do is I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 1>read a series of prompts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And I would like you to answer the prompts by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 1>moving closest to the poster, which I think matches this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.230
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be chaos, and that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>We're happy with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Chaos.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 1>So roughly speaking, we've got you in this corner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of self-actualisation we've got supporting myself and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.630
<v Speaker 1>my community over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And then we've got the other one, which I've completely

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:06.250
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And someone's head's in front of it over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's life of the mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:10.770
<v Speaker 0>Life of the mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 0>Life of mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100]}

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.010

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:27.010
<v Speaker 1>What do they think the purpose of university is?

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So all you need to do now is go and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>stand next to the poster that you think sums up

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 1>what your family think the purpose of university is.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:40.050
<v Speaker 0>So careers over there, life of the mind at the

<v Speaker 0>They're.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 0>And supporting your communities over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,98,100,100]}

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean, it's like a one way system or like

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:50.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll get there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100]}

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 1>But yeah, it's a good idea.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.050
<v Speaker 3>What if one parent is in one corner?

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.490

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.660

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That's totally fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.140
<v Speaker 1>You can stand between two different posters.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of hesitation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.220
<v Speaker 1>If you need to be in the middle, that's probably

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:14.500

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.540

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.700

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.940
