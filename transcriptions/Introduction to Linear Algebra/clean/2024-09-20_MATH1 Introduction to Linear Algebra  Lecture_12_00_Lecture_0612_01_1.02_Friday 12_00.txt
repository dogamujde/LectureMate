Right.
We have the red light of.
Go.
So.
Hello?
You made it back.
That's good.
Seems slightly emptier, but I think lots of people wanted
to come to the later one, so that is not
bad.
, there is a link, please log on.
I think lots of you already have.
I'll give you another minute and then we will start.
So where are we?
We are still in the week one.
Yesterday was Thursday's lecture.
Surprisingly, today is Friday's lecture.
, we have made it to Friday's lecture.
, nothing else has really changed.
I looked up when the assessed quizzes are due Thursday
midday.
I slightly lied to you yesterday saying it was Wednesday
and to play Wednesday.
It's not.
It's Thursday.
Midday.
, otherwise, nothing's changed from yesterday.
Apart from it's now Friday.
, so we ended yesterday talking about elementary row operations.
And that is where we are going to pick up
today.
So we are going to start with a question.
If I gave you this matrix which I am doing.
What operation were operation do you think you would do
next.
So we are going to have a vote.
What do you think you should do?
I mean, there's no right answer or wrong answer.
This is a bit subjective.
There's the answer of what I would do.
But what do we think?
Let's take that off.
, what can we do to kind of as a
next step?
Have a chat with your neighbour.
Give it a bit of thought.
What would you do next?
Okay, we're up to.
100 plus votes.
I'm going to give you an extra 15 seconds.
13.
11.
10s.
Seven.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
What do we think?
Okay, so there are two very clear winners there.
People do not want to go around swapping.
That's good.
I probably wouldn't swap anything either.
, people don't want a square row.
Yeah, he'd know what went for the trick.
Why should we not square a row?
Yeah.
You can't.
That's not allowed.
So.
Yay!
Well done for not picking the one illegal option.
, it's really quite heartening to see no one picked
that.
, cool.
Okay, so then we're kind of split between two.
We want to multiply a row by a scalar, or
we want to add and subtract.
Let us see what some of our comments are.
, so we're multiplying a row by a scalar.
We've got some suggestions.
Row three times a half.
It looks nicer.
We multiply minus one by row three to make it
all positive.
That's a good point, actually.
, often that is a good idea in maths.
Even if before you go and do maybe the
next step you should do in the procedure times everything
by minus one.
Let's get rid of as many negatives as we can,
, as soon as we can because it makes life
easier.
, 24 two big.
That's another reason big numbers are big.
Let's try and keep numbers small.
, multiply those bottom out by half a half.
Two.
Why are we thinking.
Why is there a factor of two and a half?
We've got one person saying it should be minus six.
Everyone else kind of saying either a half or two.
Anyone got any ideas on two or half?
What are we thinking?
Yeah.
Make some smaller numbers for the next step.
Yeah, to make them smaller numbers.
That's a good idea.
, Yeah, I it's not I mean there is again
I said, there's kind of no right to wrong
answer making a small and more manageable.
Probably not a bad idea.
So yeah I'm liking what's going on there.
What if we go here?
This is a bit more popular.
Two thirds A few 25 comments.
What have we saying?
To create a row echelon matrix, add seven times of
row 2 to 0 three.
, first column is already in the form.
So you can turn columns two non 020.
multiply row.
We've got lots of suggestions about row three.
Add six lots of R2 or minus six lots of
row two.
everything kind of that.
The others don't make sense.
Fair enough.
Gaussian elimination.
Yeah.
So we're all kind of roughly talking about the same
similar vibes.
We want to add six lots of all subtract six
lots of row 3 to 6, lots of row one.
Generally that's probably what I would do.
I mean, you're not wrong.
If you're going to do some micro three smaller first.
That's not a wrong answer.
I would probably just dive in and get rid of
that minor six and make it zero.
So doing something row three add two lots six,
lots of row two would be nice.
, eliminate that minus six altogether.
But again, it's kind of this question is more about
you not selecting that all that and the kind of
but the ones you have picked to kind of both
somewhat valid.
, cool.
So that was our little warm up.
We are actually, this was a question I got at
the end of the lecture yesterday.
, we are going to talk about where echelon form.
So matrix is in row echelon form if it satisfies
the following three properties I have just clicked the wrong
thing.
, so we want all zeros at the bottom.
It's the first point.
In some ways it's kind of the important one, but
it's also the one that just means everything's tidy.
It's kind of.
We're tidying up.
We want everything, all the zeros, to kind of be
at the bottom where we can forget about them.
We can cross them out.
We can ignore them.
, and then we want.
So let's start drawing a matrix.
, so we're going to have a row of zeros
at the bottom.
We can't see that.
You can't see that.
Oh, we're really zoomed in, aren't we?
Let's zoom out a bit.
There we go.
, good.
Okay, so we have all of those zeros at the
bottom.
, and then we want the first non-zero entry from
the left is the one.
And we're going to call this the leading one.
Now this is quite important.
Yell out some numbers for me.
Someone eight, eight I eight.
Someone else five.
Another one.
Six.
I had a two.
, did I hear something else?
Nine.
Nine seem to be the popular one there.
Okay, so there's my matrix.
Everything else is going to be zeros.
, so I have my leading ones.
They're always to the right, , to the leftmost thing
in their in their row.
They're my leading ones.
Leading ones.
, and we have our row of zeros at the
bottom.
So every other row has some entry in, and every
leading one is to the right of all the others.
So you end up with this kind of staircase effect,
where each time we only take one step up.
We're only stepping up by one row.
We're never going to kind of double step.
Imagine you've all got , short legs.
We're not trying to skip steps.
We're going one little step at a time.
It might be we walk along a bit and then
we take another step up.
This is surprisingly hard to do on a flat thing.
, but we're never taking more than one step up
at a time.
And that's kind of how we spot, , a reduced
echelon form of matrix.
, cool.
What is a reduced row echelon form matrix?
Does anyone remember what the extra condition is?
Yeah.
And I think we have to do.
Yeah, exactly.
So each leading one is the only non-zero entry in
its column.
So which of these numbers feel free just to yell
should I strike out and make zero if I want
this to be a eight by by eight.
What else do I want to get rid of?
Six and nine.
Good.
Okay, so if all of those crosses were zeros, this
would be in reduced row echelon form.
No one ever actually says reduced row echelon form because
it's really long.
, so we you will very much see ref and
ref, ref and ref, , just because we're echelon form
is long and mathematicians are very lazy people, we work
incredibly hard to find a shorter path from A to
B.
It's kind of the point of maths.
, so yes, lazy mathematicians will abbreviate this.
Cool.
Does that kind of does the difference between the two
makes sense?
Do we kind of understand?
Yeah.
Okay, good.
Yes.
Sorry.
, are we all kind of thumbs up at the
moment.
Good or generally happy?
, wonderful.
So we can do another question.
There are six matrices.
Which ones are in?
Row echelon form or were reduced echelon form.
So we're having another vote.
, it should appear it's not the nicest thing to
look at on clap.
, so.
It's nice to.
On your phone.
I have checked this.
Oh, there's a timer on.
Ignore the timer.
We are ignoring the timer.
, but how long roughly?
, which of these are in row echelon form?
Feel free to have a bit of a chat with
your neighbour with your best maths friend.
Always good to have a maths friend.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Another 30s.
Maybe.
Oh!
We're going quiet.
Let's see how many votes we have.
Oh!
Okay, let's have 15 seconds.
More.
Ten.
Eight.
Let's see if we can get up to 175 votes.
054321.
Yeah.
175.
There we go.
Cool.
Okay.
, so the first one, most people, a clear majority
is saying it's in row echelon form, , which I'm
inclined to agree with.
Let's think about this.
We have our leading ones.
There we go.
And I can draw a kind of staircase.
There we go.
Row of zeros at the bottom.
We're in reduced echelon form.
Everyone seems happy.
That's helpful.
Cool.
Okay, so that one was the clear winner there.
So we're good.
Number two.
The clear winner is neither.
Okay, well let's clear.
, lots of people saying need.
Some people saying row echelon form.
Somebody want to tell me why?
Neither.
Yeah.
So moving to the right of the first row.
Yeah.
Good.
Anybody got anything else to say?
No.
That's good.
I would kind of agree.
You're kind of leading ones.
Are you?
Kind of.
Is that a leading one?
I guess it is.
, that you don't have a staircase.
You have a kind of double stair there, which for
short legged mathematicians is not so good.
They cannot claim that large mountain.
So we're not.
Can anyone give me a suggestion of how I could,
, what row operation I could perform to get this
into row?
Pardon?
Turn the second 1 to 0.
Yeah.
Nowadays how.
To.
For minus one.
For the second.
Yeah.
Good.
So I could take row two.
My new row two could become row two minus row
one.
And then I'd end up with one.
One.
My wrote my old row two minus row one is
going to become zero one.
And then I'm going to have 0100.
So then I could subtract row three from row two.
And I have two rows of zeros.
In fact let's do that.
I could then do row three goes to row three
minus row two.
And I'd end up with this matrix which is in
row reduced.
Well Row echelon form, not reduced row echelon form.
Too many words.
Cool, everyone.
Yes.
Is the.
This one?
So.
No.
Because again we have this double step.
So we're not allowed to to do a kind of
double step.
But this one is.
So we're not here.
We're not here.
We are here.
Hooray.
Okay.
Number three any other questions?
Actually all thoughts or comments.
No.
Okay.
Number three, the popular one seems to be we are
in row echelon form.
Some people say neither, some saying we're reduced.
We're getting a bit more a bit more discussion
here.
So anyone want to put forward their case?
Yeah.
So any throw the first element is the 0 to
1.
Yeah.
So that.
Means it's, , derived from form.
But the last column, there's, , things under the water.
So it's not really.
Yeah.
It's not reduced.
But we do have our good staircase that's going up
in single steps.
, so and there were no rows of zero midway
through.
So.
Good.
Okay.
We seem to mostly agree with that.
Number four.
Oh, number four, we've got a bit of just lots
more discussion.
Some people saying it's reduced echelon form, some people saying
it's row, reduced echelon form, some people saying it's neither.
.
Well let's have a look.
Let's look at where our leading ones are.
So each row the first non-zero entry is a one.
So that's good Are there any double steps?
Nope.
So we've got a nice little staircase which goes up
step by step.
Okay.
So so far there's no row of zeros or rows.
Start with a one and we have a good staircase.
So we're at least.
Row echelon form.
Are we reduced row echelon form.
Yeah.
Let's.
Oh that was a general consensus of yes and unspoken
people.
Let's do this by volume.
Let's be fun.
I've never done this before.
If it's yes, say yes.
Yes.
If it's no, say no.
Okay.
That worked quite well.
Good.
It is a very reduced echelon form.
So every row that has a one in it has
no other number.
So we are row reduced echelon form reduced row echelon
form I keep mixing those words up don't I?
I don't mean to.
Sorry.
There are too many words.
Reduced row echelon form.
, okay.
Where were we?
Number five.
Number five.
Most people by some way are actually saying neither.
That's good.
It is neither.
Anyone got an idea about how I could put in
to row reduced echelon form?
Row echelon form?
, any ideas to divide it?
Yeah.
Divide the last row.
What?
I divide the last row by two.
Good.
So row three is going to go to half of
row three.
Oops.
Why don't I.
Why to be.
That's a good question.
Row three.
And then I'm going to have 12210112001.
What's the last number going to be.
Yell at me.
Oh good good.
And then we have every row starts with a one
and we have our nice steady staircase.
Good Okay.
Our last one.
What are we saying?
Most people are saying neither.
What?
.
What do we think?
How could I make it into reduced echelon form?
Yeah.
Swap the third and the fourth row.
Yeah.
Good.
So row three and row four could swap.
And then am I done?
What form are we then in.
Reduced.
Good.
0001800000.
There are too many numbers in a matrix.
Good.
So then all our leading ones with the beginning and
we have our nine.
Oops.
We have a nice staircase.
Okay, so that was quite a lot.
But we did find them all.
So that's good.
.
Why do we this?
Why is this a form we want to go to?
, anyone got any ideas?
Why are we quite, , row echelon form?
Yeah.
You can solve for each other.
Yeah.
Were you going to say anything differently?
Nope.
Yeah.
So we have two results.
The two kind of big theorems in the reading.
One that says all matrices can be written into row
reduced row echelon form.
I will say right.
Eventually.
, so any matrix in the world can be written
as something that looks a bit that, which is
quite a big result when you think about if you
just take a moment to think about it.
Any matrix in the world just using three rules can
be made to have ones leading them.
Zeros can be made mainly to look zeros and
ones because that's what this form does.
It means potentially up to half your matrix is the
entries is zero, which is quite a big deal.
, you can cancel quite a lot.
, and then we've got so that's them 2.2.
And then we have this other theorem that says if
you perform a sequence of operations, , the results our
equivalent system of linear equations.
So we spoke a bit about this yesterday.
Can anyone remind me what equivalent means.
That's the key word in that sentence.
I mean one in front of the other.
So I had identical.
And one one implies the other same set of solutions.
That's what I'm looking for.
So these two matrices here, they're not the same.
They are not equal to each other.
If you multiplied this matrix by something and the this
one by the same thing.
You'd get different answers if you added them.
You get different answers.
There's not they're not the same matrix.
Do not think they're the same matrix, but they have
the same as a set of linear equations.
As a system of linear equations.
They have the same set of solutions.
So the x and y values were the x values.
Here the satisfy this also satisfy this system, which makes
sense actually if you think about this this is saying
x equals one.
And this is saying x equals two.
And this is saying zero equals one and x equals
one x equals.
Yeah this is not a consistent system.
But yeah they've got the same set of solutions.
This is not consistent.
And this is also not consistent okay.
So those are the two kind of important things.
, which then allow us to, as we heard before,
write down solutions.
So let us start a new sheet of paper.
Well, go back to the Aldridge paper.
We got this matrix 122110112 and 001 and a half.
So that was from matrix number five.
, and again this was a question I heard yesterday.
Sometimes people write a line.
We're going to see what kind of why in a
minute.
I guess it's separating out the system from the answer
to solutions.
Sometimes I'll draw a line.
Sometimes I won't draw a line.
Sometimes the textbook will draw a line.
Sometimes a textbook won't draw a line.
It's one of those maths things that sometimes happens and
sometimes don't.
We don't care if you draw a line or not.
You can if you want.
Sometimes it's useful to have the distinction.
, right.
So we're going to do a method called back substitution.
, and essentially what we're going to do is we're
going to rewrite this method or this matrix.
It's an augmented matrix.
We're going to go back and write it as a
system of equations.
So what's the last equation in the system.
Z equals a half.
Good.
That's really nice I know what z is.
what's the second one.
Y plus z equals two.
Good.
But I also know z equals one half.
So that's going to give me the y equals two
minus one half.
So three halves.
Good.
What's the first equation.
Okay I got that mostly from the various mumbling.
Good.
So that's one minus two.
Lots of one half is going to be zero minus
three two.
Lots of three halves.
It's going to be minus three.
So very quickly I've got the solution out.
Hooray I've solved a system.
And that was very easy to solve compared to for
example , this matrix.
Can anyone tell me what the solution to this matrix
is?
Anyone want to take a guess about the solution to
that matrix?
Is all that linear system.
It's exactly the same.
Yep.
Because yes.
So a little a little bit of extra things.
If you want to spend some fun time on a
Friday night doing some extra maths.
Can you show that I can row reduce that bottom
matrix?
If I follow Gaussian elimination and go all the way
through, I get that top matrix.
You should be able to do it.
You should be able to reduce that into that and
get the same answer out.
But hopefully we all agree it was a lot easier
to get the answer out of the top one.
We could almost just kind of read that off.
In fact, if we're in, , reduced row echelon form,
we can just read the answer off.
So if I kind of further, more reduced this matrix.
Can anyone tell me what matrix I'd get if I
went all the way to reduced row echelon form?
I'll give you a clue.
The first three columns would look that.
What would my last column be?
Anyone got any ideas?
Minus three.
Three halves.
And what were the last one be?
One half.
Good.
So you can literally just read the answer off.
Hello.
.
Which makes life really easy.
So you don't necessarily have to go all the way
to reduced row echelon form.
You can get the answer fairly easily from row echelon
form.
But I mean, if you did it in the real
world, when you're applying this to something outside of this
course, you're probably dealing with bigger matrices.
This is really used in computing a lot.
You're probably coding this up.
If you're coding it up, you might.
It's not that many steps from there to there.
So you might as well get your computer to take
you all the way to there.
, so it's useful to have both.
Cool.
Okay.
Do we have any questions on that or comments or
thoughts or complaints.
No.
Good.
Okay.
So I promised you yesterday I would give you the
formal definition of rank.
More formal than the amount of meaningful equations.
It's actually the number of leading ones.
Of a matrix when it's in row echelon form.
, which makes sense if we think about what, ,
elementary row operations doing, it's filtering out unnecessary information systematically
is systematically removing information that's repeated about X and then
y and then z.
So each row operation takes out stuff that's repeated by
the other equations.
So actually we are in reducing our matrix.
We are reducing the number of unnecessary equations, unnecessary bits
of information, until we get a system that essentially is
just telling us what x is, what y's and what
z is.
, so it makes sense.
The number of leading ones should be the kind of
amount of useful information it's telling us.
Okay.
So what rank.
Let's do a quick.
We might just do this as a kind of quick
run through what ranks number one three.
Good.
What ranks number two.
Three.
So two of having three and two.
Somebody want to give me a bit of an explanation.
Yeah.
Number one when you know exactly when in row echelon
form.
So we're only in row echelon form here.
So this has rank two.
Okay.
What about number three.
We've done number three haven't we know we've not.
What's round number.
Matrix number three.
Good.
Matrix number four.
Oh that's almost designed.
matrix number five.
Matrix number six.
Good.
We all seem happy with that.
That's fun.
Okay, so that's nice if we've got all our answers
out.
But this is happens.
We've got one.
We've got a point.
We've got one unique answer.
The unique answer is minus three.
Three halves half.
That's a point.
What happens if I have infinitely many answers?
Anyone got any any thoughts about that?
Fair enough.
Let's have a look at it.
, let's take this matrix 120001000.
And I'm going to draw a line this time 640.
Okay.
, what's the rank of this matrix?
Two.
Yeah, I've got two leading ones.
Okay.
And we can, if we think about converting this back
into, , a system of equation form, I've kind of
got x, y, and z.
, it's a three dimensional system.
And I'm kind of saying, well, there's a leading one
kind of with x so I can determine what x
is, and there's a leading one with Z.
So I can determine what z is.
But why does not have a leading one in its
column.
So I'm going to have a bit of a problem.
I can't really determine what Y is.
There's no leading one.
I've not got a piece of meaningful information about why.
So this is going to be our free variable.
So I can say well that's y equal s I
know that's going to be my free variable.
Then this bottom equation is just going to tell me
well z equals four.
So I know z is fixed.
And then what's x going to be.
What's this top equation.
Yeah six minus two s.
Does that make sense to everybody.
Good.
So I've kind of got.
I've managed to the leading ones tell me which
or the lack of a leading one tells me where
my free variables are.
And even though I've not got a point as a
solution now, I've still got a set of solutions.
So just yesterday, I could say all my sets
of solutions are s six minus two, s, s and
four.
And what actually might be more useful is to write
this down as to kind of split the s off.
So I could say this is 604 plus s lots
of minus two one zero.
Does everyone see what I've done there.
Bit of a step.
So I've got this.
I think it's hardest to see in this first point.
I've not got an S here.
So it's going into this kind of vector without an
S.
But here I've got a factor of S that I
can kind of take out.
And I can say it's minus two and one.
Okay.
, so this is kind of on what we were
talking about yesterday here.
I now have a point on my line, and now
I have a direction I can walk across.
And S is telling me how far I can walk.
So six zero minus four is a point here.
Two minus two one zero is a direction there and
S is telling me how many steps I should go
in this direction.
And I'm walking along a line.
Does that make sense to people?
Yes, yes.
Cool.
So this is the basic solution.
Whoops.
I can split it up.
So let's have a bit of a think about this
in higher dimensions.
Let's return to GeoGebra.
, I have a point.
So a point A I've just randomly picked it's 604.
And then I'm going to define the point B I'm
going to write a line.
It's the point A plus some steps in the direction
of minus two one zero.
Oh look it's the thing we just had.
, and if I change what f is if I
change how many steps I'm walking.
Oh, look, I'm forming a line that goes through the
point A, which is what we'd expect.
Okay, I could do another direction.
Instead of going off in that direction.
I could go off in that direction.
So I could instead, instead of looking at minus two
one zero, I could look at minus three for two.
And there's another parameter telling me how many steps I
can walk in that direction, and where am I going
to end up there?
Oh going fast.
There we go.
There's a line in that direction.
So can anyone guess if I have the system with
both of these?
What's going to happen?
Books.
My space of solutions.
Going to be a plane?
Yeah.
Two dimensional plane.
In fact, if I twist it there, that's quite clear.
You can see the plane.
Okay.
So let's imagine I want a point that can go
in in the plane.
So far I've only got two lines.
How do I get to a general point in this
plane.
Any ideas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Linear combination.
Pardon.
Yeah.
So we're going to take a linear combination of the
two.
So I'm going to go some steps in s in
the s direction and some steps in the R direction.
So where is my point D.
It should be in my plane.
There we go.
It's up there all the way up there.
That's not very good for you.
If my plane.
.
Say, if I wanted my D to be more.
Let's try and.
Move this over a.
Bit.
There we go.
.
I could move.
So my point D is some point generally in this
plane.
And I can kind of go out to places between
these two coordinates.
So in later courses we'll kind of see.
What we've done here is to find two new axes.
You're used to getting to the point.
If I give you two axes and I say go
to one one, you used to go in one direction
here and one direction here, and you're kind of here.
But what if your your axes are actually more
this?
That's what we're doing now.
They're not necessarily right angles, but we've still got two
axes and a linear combination of I go so many
ways in this direction and then so many ways in
this direction, I can cover every point in my plane.
It's just I'm no longer walking that.
I'm walking perhaps a bit more naturally that.
And then maybe I take a little step forward.
Does that make some sense?
We're going to see a lot more of this kind
of idea.
So it will come back in later bits of the
course.
Okay, let's return to a vote.
You've listened to me speak for a long time.
So that's not what I want.
Let's return to this matrix.
That's what I want.
Matrix number four.
How many free variables would I need to express the
space of solutions?
, I'm going to give you.
That's not what I want.
Yeah.
No.
know which one of the three variables.
That's my question.
So we've now got, , you can't see.
That's a good point.
So we've got this matrix here.
I'm going to put a line here and take off
the answer.
And then I'm going to say we have one, two
three, four, five, six variables.
I'm not labelling them xyz ABC because that's long.
I'm labelling them X1X2X2X4X5XX.
So I've got six variables I'm working in six variable
six dimensions.
which one of these are the free variables.
And I'm going to give you just a couple of
minutes to vote.
I think lots of people already voting.
Doo doo doo doo.
Feel free to have a bit of a chat.
Okay.
Ten 987654321.
We seem to have very clear consensus, which is good.
.
Yes.
The vast majority of you are right.
So let's have a quick look at the comments.
, but.
Yeah.
Where are the leading ones?
There are no leading ones.
There were no leading ones.
There were no leading ones.
, so, yeah, there are no leading ones.
Let's just have a quick look.
Where?
My shoes.
They're here.
Under here.
.
Where are my shoes?
There is no leading one.
There is a leading one in column six.
So if we look at column six, there's a leading
one at the bottom.
, cool.
Okay, so if.
We.
If we keep going with that matrix, I'm going to
try and see if you can.
There you go.
Okay.
So we have that matrix there which you hopefully can
still see You can't see it because I've not changed
the screen.
There we go.
, so you've got this, , matrix there.
We know x3 and x5 are the other three variables,
so let's call them S and let's call them r.
, and then let's think about the solution.
So the general solution x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6
is going to look what is x6 going to
be one.
Yeah good x5 is going to be are x4.
What's x4 going to be.
Two minus five are good.
So I need I know that one lot of x4
plus five lots of x5 equals two.
But we know x5 equals r.
So it's two minus five.
Lots of x5.
Okay.
What about x3?
We know is S what's x two?
Three plus four s.
Okay, this is the harder one.
You might all have to murmur collectively as a group.
So can we say somewhat clearly what X1 is.
I did actually hear generally that.
So that was quite good.
Well done.
, good.
So there is our space of solutions slightly misplaced across
the page actually.
, and we can do what we did before.
So what is a point on my plane of solutions.
For three zero.
Good.
What's next?
Perfect.
Cool.
And then we're going to add s lots of what.
My life.
Is.
Good.
And I'm adding all lots of what?
They.
Look at you.
You just found the the the equation of a two
dimensional plane in a six dimensional space.
None of you probably have done that before.
That's really cool.
That's six dimensions.
That's big.
, in general terms, , that's.
Yeah.
Well done.
That went a lot better than I was expecting.
Yeah.
Let's have a round of applause.
.
Cool.
That's gone way better than it ever has before.
I'm genuinely impressed.
, yeah.
So that is the basic solution that we have.
, over two dimensional plane in six dimensional space.
So we have a .430201.
And I've got -12 1000 in that direction, maybe minus
six zero zero minus five one zero in that direction
that I can walk off in.
We can't imagine this.
This is I can't bring up GeoGebra and check this.
We can't physically get our heads around it.
So that is cool.
Okay, we have five minutes left and I want to
just do a really quick thing.
So this is mainly just to check we know what
some keywords are.
If I give you that matrix the system is going
to be homogeneous.
If what do I need to happen.
Oh I'm really bad at this today.
What do I need to happen for that system that's
going to appear on the board?
There we go.
What needs to happen if that's going to be homogeneous
P equals zero.
Wonderful.
, what if I wanted to be consistent?
I might give you a minute just to chat to
your friend.
I'm going to give you 30s to chat to your
friend.
Okay?
We're running out of time.
So what are we thinking?
What do we need to be for that to be
consistent?
Anyone got any ideas?
I'm hearing a lot of people saying A equals B.
That would actually work if I did equal B.
That's one of the cases.
It could be consistent.
Anybody got any other ideas?
A should be zero.
Okay.
What?
Someone had their hand up in the middle there.
A equals zero.
But it's consistent with anything but zero.
A has to be, not zero.
Okay, so we've got some different answers.
That was a fairly comprehensive one at the end.
Let's think about what that bottom equation is saying.
It's saying a lots of x4 equals b.
You can't see a lots of x4 is equal to
b.
That's what that last bit saying.
So if A equals 0BA better equals zero.
Or else you've got zero equals two again which we
don't .
So yes I'm liking this idea at the back.
Either b equals zero.
In which case we just take x4 to be zero.
Or if b isn't zero then we kind of need
a tb0.
Otherwise we're going to have some.
Hang on.
What did I just say?
If B is not equal to zero, we don't want
A to be zero, because otherwise we're going to have
zero on the left hand side and something not zero
on the right hand side, which is not nice.
So we've kind of got two options.
Either b equals zero or b doesn't equal zero and
A doesn't equal zero okay.
Everybody happy.
They're good.
We are out of time.
so thank you all for coming.
The reading quiz will be released on Monday.
It's got some videos of me doing some examples of
stuff, and then it's got some questions on the reading.
The assessed and practice quizzes also released on Wednesday Monday.
Please do them before Thursday midday.
I will see you all on Tuesday.
