Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
We have the red light of go because red means
go.
So, hello.
Welcome to the first actual lecture.
, please do do the attendance Thursday is attendance day.
, so that is important.
I'm going to give you another five seconds.
Nobody's doing anything.
, two people back.
, okay.
It's going, it's going.
.
So.
yes, proper linear algebra lecture first one.
So where are we in theory?
You have done the reading of section 1.1, 1.2 and
1.3.
That is the understanding that you have done that reading.
I am going to work on the assumption you have
done that reading.
, we are in Thursday's lecture because today's Thursday and
we are in a lecture.
We have another lecture on Friday.
On Monday, the reading.
All the quizzes are released on Monday morning.
The reading quiz you should probably do before your tutorial,
which will be next Tuesday, same as it was this
week.
And then you're going to have the practice and assessed
quizzes, , that you need to do.
Oh, it is Wednesday I think you need to do
before Wednesday.
, all of that is very calculation based.
It's sit down.
Can you in this case do a load of row
reduction.
Solve some linear systems.
Next week there will be a piece of homework released.
So next week that will cover material.
From that it will have one question from this week.
One question more related to next week's content that you're
doing with Andreas.
And that is more focusing on proof skills rather than
just calculation skills.
So that's kind of where we are.
On that note, I know some people heard this on
Tuesday in the tutorials.
Please log on to stack before Monday.
So here is learn.
Hopefully you have come across this.
Anyone got no idea how to find this web page
at all?
No.
Great.
, if you go on to online assessments, quizzes and
lecture materials, please before Monday, do click through to that.
, when we refer to stack, that is the link
we are talking about.
Eventually it should load.
, basically the system needs to see you before Monday
and before anything assists released because otherwise it back scene
things happen.
So fun things happen.
If you log on, please log on before Monday.
, normally it should hopefully be faster than that.
I'm not sure why it's not wanting to log on.
We'll give it a second.
, okay, so while we slightly wait for that, does
anyone have any comments on the reading?
How do we find the reading?
Was it horrible?
Okay, weird.
What was that?
It was okay.
Middling.
Are we most people middling?
I'm seeing some kind of.
I'm seeing no one jumping up and down, nodding their
head, saying it was the most wonderful reading of their
life, which, frankly, I would be surprised and questioning your
sanity if you were.
, but yeah, that is kind of where we were
expecting it to be somewhat familiar, maybe a different way
of writing it, different way of looking at it.
Welcome to university maths.
This first bit of that you're doing this kind of
first year, most of it the maths.
It's a lots of different ways of thinking about maths
and lots of ways of writing maths.
, so it should kind of the particularly the beginning.
That's the hard, the hard bit different ways of seeing
it.
Okay.
That's still not loading.
So I'm going to give up on it.
Sorry.
, let us return to this.
So to start with, we are going to actually think
about what is a linear equation.
, so there are five equations.
, and there's going to be another poll if I
can bring it up.
The bomb.
It's going to appear.
There we go.
So another poll for you to log on.
That is the poll for today where we are actually
doing content.
Doo doo doo doo doo.
Lots of people logging on.
Okay.
Numbers seem to be so.
No sudden surge of numbers.
Oh.
We'll.
Wait for everyone to get on.
The bus.
So I think.
Okay, so the first question.
Is which of the following are linear?
Let us have a vote.
To give you a minute to see how we're getting
on.
Do to do.
Feel free to have a chat.
I'll give a slight clue.
It is more than one.
It is not just one of these equations that is
linear.
Okay.
I'm going to give you 10s.
Eight.
64321.
Right.
Let's see.
.
Cool.
So most of you all, we've got some comments.
That's exciting.
I comments.
Let's go back to see this.
, so we have generally most people seem for is
linear.
Good.
That is definitely a linear equation for most definitely linear.
, one is not linear.
I also agree with that.
, what's the comment?
It is a function of x.
Anyone else got any comments about why one is not
linear?
Yeah that's a quadratic.
So yeah definitely not.
, we also seem to agree that three isn't linear.
So nine.
Okay.
.
Any ideas about why three isn't linear?
It's exponential.
Yeah.
Good.
There's a good exponential term in there.
Okay.
, we seem a bit more conflicted between two and
to some degree, five.
There seems to be some popularity around that.
So, , what I'm going to give you is a
minute to find someone around you and have a discussion
are two and five linear, and then we'll have another
vote.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, let's try having another vote.
You can keep chatting, but feel free to give.
A.
Vote.
Okay, let's have another 10s 987543.
My seconds are very uniform.
Two.
One.
Okay, let's see for any better.
Okay, so we seem a lot happier that two is
linear.
Let's have a quick look at the comments.
Coefficient is constant.
Coefficients are constant.
Yep.
So if we look at number three the
second equation we have log two and we have five
cubed.
All the coefficients.
Now both of those are functions of a number.
But a function of a number is just another number.
So log three.
Five cubed.
Five cubes 125.
No idea what log three is off the top of
my head, but they are just numbers.
So yeah, good.
It is linear because it is.
I that answer.
, good.
Okay.
, we still seem a bit conflicted about the last
one.
Let's see.
Even if it's invalid, it's still linear variables.
All power of one.
It's linear with no solution.
Those are all true.
It is an inconsistent linear equation.
It's not true.
It's definitely not true.
Zero does not equal to.
It is a well-known statement or an invalid statement.
But it is definitely a linear equation.
Inconsistent.
But linear is what we're going to call that.
So.
It has no solutions, but it is linear.
Good.
Okay.
, so another question.
There you go.
The three linear equations two, four and five.
, okay.
So following on from that, true or false or solutions
to a linear equation lie on a straight line.
What are we thinking?
True or false?
Again feel free to have a chat with your neighbour.
See how we feel.
To a picture.
Maybe.
Oh, okay.
We've got a good number of votes.
Let's have another 20s.
Oh, you've all gone quiet.
Okay, maybe we don't need 20s.
Maybe you have collectively decided we've had enough.
.
And let us see what we're going to do.
.
Oh, okay.
Interesting.
Again, we're a bit conflicted, which is good.
We this.
We're asking more interesting questions.
, so let's have a look at the comments.
Line equals linear.
Good.
, line equals linear.
Yeah.
So Norm, at school you probably did hear that a
line is a linear thing.
Line's linear.
Kind of in the linguistics.
, what about false?
, it can be in higher dimensions.
Could lie on a plane.
High dimensions.
High dimensions.
Only false when solutions do not exist.
That's a very good point.
If you've got zero x plus zero, y equals two.
Those solutions don't lie on a line.
Those solutions don't exist.
, you definitely can't draw solutions.
So maybe I should.
Maybe a better question would be all solutions to a
consistent linear equation line a straight line.
, okay.
So let's give this a bit of a bit of
a think.
, I'm going to start writing.
So yeah.
Let me if my at the back particularly the back
if my handwriting goes a bit small.
, no, I want that to be there.
, let us consider this equation.
Hopefully we will all agree that this is a linear
equation.
Can we all see that?
Oh we can I hope.
Okay, so that is a linear equation.
Can anyone think of a solution to that equation.
Anyone want to yell out an x y, z that
satisfy that zero?
Good.
There's a solution.
000 definitely satisfies that.
Anybody think of another one.
Yeah.
111.
Another good one.
Okay.
Another one.
Yeah.
Two.
Two.
Two.
Two.
Yeah.
We could keep going.
121.
One two.
Zero even.
Yeah.
That's a better one.
That's actually a solution.
Okay.
Those are three solutions.
Let's draw out some axes.
So we have oh I've got different coloured pens.
We've got the origin.
We've got 111 which is kind of here.
And we've got one, two zero, which is kind of
there.
Do we think those all lie on a line?
No, no, those are quite clearly two different lines.
Okay.
So we're.
False.
Sorry everybody.
Linear does not mean lying.
I'm a horrible human being for even asking you that
question.
Linguistics is nonsense.
, so let us actually think about what else we
can do here.
Where do those solutions lie?
, I don't want to go there.
So there we go.
Here is, .
Oh, that's not quite what I want to do yet.
I want to stick here.
, let's let's think about this solution.
I could have let me in the reading, we saw
that we could introduce parameters.
So kind of other letters that we can write our
solution terms of.
So there is a parameter x is a parameter s.
All I have said is x equals s.
It's nothing actually that fundamental.
I could also say y equals r.
There you go.
It's another parameter.
Having just said, none of this is very fundamental, which
let's then write down what z equals.
If z is going to satisfy this and x equals
s and y equals r, what z got to equal
in terms of my parameters to s minus r.
Perfect okay.
So far so not terrible.
Hopefully.
but now let us have a have a quick
look.
Have people seen GeoGebra before.
Hands up if you've seen GeoGebra before.
Yeah that's a good number of you.
Cool.
It's really fun.
Go and play with it.
It's a kind of you can do loads of stuff
with it and it's really good for linear algebra, so
we will probably be using it quite a lot.
, Anyway, so here's my point.
So I could write a solution to this point is
going to look x, y, z.
And it's going to look what if x is
S, y is r and z is two s minus
r.
That's what all solutions are going to look .
So there's my point there.
And I've got my smear and they can change.
There we go.
So there are my solutions.
All possible solutions running out.
They're definitely not on a line.
What kind of shape are they?
Anybody got any ideas?
But what we are where all these solutions actually do
lie.
In.
A plane.
Yeah.
Look, if I line this up now, can I line
it up?
There we go.
It looks a line there, but in three dimensions,
it's a plane.
In fact, there is the plane that we are scooting
around them.
So, , what we actually have is we have three
variables.
And two parameters.
Or sometimes people call these free variables because they're free
to be whatever we want.
In fact, in GeoGebra, I'm setting them.
I set them to be between -3 and 3, minus
two and four, simply because it kind of made the
screen look pretty.
But they could be anything.
They could go up to a thousand, a million, whatever.
, it's just they didn't fit on screen then.
But these are free parameters.
They can be whatever.
They can scroll through things, they can do weird and
wonderful things.
, and our solutions lie in a two dimensional plane.
So actually, , we can say more generally that a
linear equation.
In n variables.
Has its solutions lying in a n minus one dimensional
plane or hyperplane.
Sometimes we call them hyperplane if it's kind of the
posh maths word.
Pardon?
Oh, not on the screen.
There we go.
That's now on the screen.
Okay.
Yeah.
Feel free to yell at me when something falls off
the screen.
, yes.
So sometimes we call it call this a hyperplane.
, if.
It's.
, you might see that language if it's kind of
three, 4 or 5 dimensions because it's not necessarily a
plane in the way you think of a plane.
, cool.
And that can people kind of understand why?
If we have two variables, why are we going to
have a two dimensional plane?
What are my two three variables?
Let me do.
They let me go in two directions.
So if we think if we proceed the vector equation
of a plane where you have a point on the
plane, and then you might have t times another vector
that lets you go in one direction, and then you
might have s times another vector that lets you go
in another direction.
There you go.
Two dimensions.
I can walk in two dimensions.
I'm not stuck in one dimension in a line.
So the number of free variables tells me how many
directions I can move in.
And that's why we're going to lie on a however
many dimensional plane.
Everyone happy so far?
Wonderful.
Do we have any questions or thoughts?
Feelings?
Comments?
Complaints?
No.
Feel free to interrupt at any point.
This is very much a kind of interactive thing.
Okay, so let us now return to our.
Let's stop that and let us return to, , here.
So I gave the question away there.
I can make that statement true by saying it's happening
in two variables.
It is true that a solution to a linear equation
in two variables lie on a line, provided they exist.
.
Cool.
Okay.
.
What about though?
Well, so bear that in mind.
How many solutions or what dimension Did the solutions of
x plus two y equal four.
Where do they lie?
On a line.
Because it literally says if you have two variables and
two linear equation two variables, they lie on a line,
okay.
They lie on a line.
Let's go back to GeoGebra.
.
Useful thing.
There we go.
I can type in x plus two, y equals four.
Oops, I can't actually and I'm not in the place
I want to be.
X plus two y equals four.
And nothing's appearing.
That's worrying.
Oh dear.
This is why technology you shouldn't trust technology.
There we go.
That looks better.
Right?
, x plus two Y equals four.
That's not a line.
You all just said.
You just said on the board that the solution should
lie on a line.
Why am I getting a plane?
It's GeoGebra wrong.
Yes.
Yeah.
So you do have to be really careful that.
Yes, that looks an equation, a linear equation, two
variables.
But that doesn't necessarily mean all we're working with is
two variables.
In this case, z could be anything.
So there's a really sneaky thing that mathematicians can do
where we can say x plus two y equals four.
Go away and solve that.
But how many what space are you working in?
Are you working in just x and Y?
In which case that's not too bad.
Or have you got Z?
Or have you got a, b c d e f
g?
How?
So you need to be aware of how many variables
you've got in the background.
How many are in your back pocket.
You might only be playing with two of them, but
if you've got three of them in play, then that
third one is still doing something.
Okay, so everything comes with a slight health warning.
Be aware of how many dimensions you're actually working with.
Okay, so , that's linear equations.
What about system of linear equations?
How many solutions can a system of two equations in
two variables.
So I'm saying now we've only got x and y.
There is no hidden z sneaking around.
How many solutions can that possibly have?
Zero, one and infinity.
Good.
Yeah.
So how can we have zero?
Yes.
If y two linear equations.
What kind of parallel then they never cross.
How about how would I get one solution when they.
Cos.
Yeah.
There we go.
One solution.
And what was the third answer.
Infinity.
Yeah.
Cool.
When do I get infinity?
When it's the same line.
Good.
Good.
So if we kind of think about this, this is
a going back to a kind of dimension counting.
Here we've got one dimension of solutions.
Here we've got zero dimensions.
And here we just have no solutions.
So a point is a zero dimensional thing.
I remember this being a slightly weird thing to get
my head around.
The reason being, let's go back to a me crab
crawling along the stage.
If I am a point, how many directions can I
move in?
None.
Yeah, there were no free parameters.
I'm stuck here and I can't move, which is a
bit annoying if I've got to spend the rest of
the lecture here.
And so I'm going to become a line again.
, so yes, zero dimensions if you've got no directions
to move in.
So free parameters are actually three variables or parameters, depending
on how you want to call them, are quite important
because they tell you how how dimensional your spaces.
, so if we have a system of equations, we've
seen that if we only had a linear equation provided
it was consistent, we got a one dimensional space.
So if we adding equations.
Can not always but it can reduce the dimension.
Of the space we're working in of the space of
solutions.
By well one adding I suppose I should say adding
an equation reduces it by one can reduce it by
one.
Not always.
Here we added another equation And it didn't.
So it is not always true.
That's gone off the screen.
Thank you.
Do yell at me.
There we go.
That's all on the screen.
Wonderful.
Okay.
.
So.
Let us, , return to to our first GeoGebra.
There we.
Go.
Oh, everything's disappeared again.
Please reload sensibly.
There we go.
So that was our plane of solutions that we had.
Let me now add a second plane and I'm going
to add.
What am I going to add?
I'm going to add the plane two x minus y
minus z equals zero.
So we just to note before we had x plus
two y minus z equals zero.
.
And now we're adding this.
No we didn't.
This is the one we had before.
This is the first one.
And now we're going to add this second one.
So we've now got a system of two linear equations
and three unknowns.
So if I add to this equation what are we
going to be x plus two y minus z equals
zero.
Cool.
And let's just change the colour of that so it's
easier to see.
there we.
Go.
Okay.
So we have two planes.
, what dimension are we expecting?
The space of solutions to be one dimension, a line.
In fact, we can see it.
Line.
It's where these two planes cross, Which is what we're
expecting.
, and actually we can see this in terms of
the parameter.
So remember, if we remember before we had x equals
s, y equals r and we then had z equals
to s minus r.
If we add these to our second equation we're
then going to have well s plus two lots of
ys.
So two r minus z.
So minus two s minus r equals zero.
Can simplify that up I'm going to get three r
minus s I do believe.
Minus.
Minus one.
What minus minus is a.
So I get two minus minus r.
So three r and s minus two s is minus
s.
Am I wrong?
I might be wrong.
I'm right.
Okay.
Sorry.
It's really weird standing up here.
Suddenly you lose the ability to do somewhat maths.
Okay, so that now means s equals to the R,
okay.
So that means the space of solutions before we had
them as SR2S minus r.
But this extra equation lets us write one of those
parameters in terms of the other.
So now I can get the equation of my line
as well S is three r.
So this can be three r or 3 or 4
times two is six r minus r is five r.
So there we go.
I now have a space with one parameter.
So what dimension am I one.
Yeah I can move in a line.
That is all good.
Cool.
Everybody happy so far then?
, so yeah.
So we'll talk about this a bit more tomorrow.
But the rank of , the system of the augmented
matrix associated to the system.
One thing it's kind of doing is counting the I'm
going to write here meaningful.
Equations in your system.
So if you've got two, , two lines that are
the same, the rank is not going to count it
twice.
It's only counting the ones that actually contribute to the
solution is one way of kind of thinking about rank
that can be quite helpful.
Good.
Everyone happy so far?
Any questions?
Does anyone have a question?
No.
So in the reading this then led to theorem 1.2.2.
So hopefully we saw this in the reading.
, if a system of m equations in n variables.
So it makes it quite clear how many variables you're
working in.
So even if all your equations look they're only
in two variables again, health warning check how many you
were actually working in.
Are you in three dimensions?
Four dimensions.
Five dimensions okay.
We want these to be consistent.
What does consistent mean has a solution.
Yeah.
So inconsistent means we have no solutions.
Consistent means has solutions.
At least one solution okay.
And we're going to say the rank is are.
So we're counting the number of meaningful equations.
Then as a generalisation of that statement I wrote up
some time ago in the box which I've now lost
somewhere.
, this first point is exactly what I wrote.
If we've only got one equation.
The set of solutions line in n minus r dimensional
space.
So in.
Actually if you in the reading it says has n
minus r parameters.
But I think we've established number of parameters equals dimension.
I will stop doing that dance eventually.
and this is the big, big theorem that one
of the big themes of this week's reading.
, and the first part's the kind of important part,
, two and three follow immediately.
Why, if n equals r, why is there a unique
solution?
Because all three variables.
Yeah n minus r equal to zero.
Exactly.
So there were no free variables I'm a point.
My point is a unique solution if I'm anything other
than a point.
And provided I exist, if I'm on a line, how
many solutions are there on the line?
Infinitely many.
If I'm on a plane, there are infinitely many.
If I'm in a 264 dimensional hyperplane.
There are definitely infinitely many solutions, so the only time
there is a unique solution is when the number of
all of your equations equal the number of variables, and
all of them are contributing to that answer.
Okay.
Good.
.
So next question, we are moving on to a slightly
different bit.
Now that's the end of that bit.
, you may be pleased to know.
So another question.
.
This one I'm going to give you a bit longer
for now.
What are you seeing?
, if there is a system of equations, three equations
in three unknowns.
I'm only in three dimensions.
, and my question.
Is.
.
Firstly turn to your neighbour and find the augmented matrix.
What is the augmented matrix.
And then I'm going to give you four options.
One of which one of these does not come from
a raw operation.
I'm going to give you a while for this because
this is a bit convoluted.
Let us first find the augmented matrix and then we'll
we'll do some more operations.
So if you will write your augmented matrix down actually
on, .
On, on a piece of paper and hold it up
when you're done or a tablet or something.
And we'll see.
How.
We get on.
So what is the augmented matrix?
Yes.
Pardon.
Yeah.
No.
So we're just writing down on a piece of paper
just the augmented matrix to begin with.
Okay, let's.
If you're done, try holding it up and let me.
I'm going to have to come and.
Oh.
What are we getting for the augmented matrix?
Anyone going to hold anything up for me?
Okay.
Things are looking looking good.
Okay, I'm just going to run around the whole lecture
theatre.
Feel free to wave something at me.
Good.
We're looking good.
We're looking good.
Good.
I'm liking these answers.
I now have to run around the whole while.
And this was a mistake.
Good.
Nice.
Excellent.
We all seem happy with the augmented matrices.
What are we on this side?
Excellent.
Good.
Okay, so too many stairs.
There are a lot of you.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Excellent.
Okay, so I think nearly all of you got the
right answer there.
Which is.
Good.
, so let us now do the go back to
our poll.
There were four matrices.
I have performed some kind of operation on all of
them.
Three of them are a valid row operation.
One of them is something I made up.
Which one did I make up?
Again, I'm going to give you another couple of minutes
to sit and work through because it is a bit
tricky.
This one.
What have I done to each of these matrices from
the augmented matrix?
Okay, I'm going to give you another 30s.
And then.
And then we'll discuss this a bit.
It's absolutely fine if you don't know the answer we
are going to go through it.
So, , you don't have to vote, but it would
be nice if you did vote.
Even a wrong answer is good.
Put some fun comments in.
Everything's anonymous so it doesn't really matter.
Right.
I'm going to give you another 15 seconds.
Ten.
Eight.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two and one.
Cool.
Okay, right.
I'm liking this.
So most people who voted, we seem to have a
clear a clear.
There seems to be one clear winner.
One that seems happier than the rest.
And actually, that is the correct answer.
So yay!
But let's just discuss it.
, so in the first one, what did we do?
What did I do for the first matrix?
So I went from, oh, hang on, I now have
a problem.
You can't see the matrices.
Let's do this.
.
So how did I get from the augmented matrix to
the matrix?
111111 minus two three halves 2112.
Yes.
Divided by two I divided by one by two.
So we have a slightly weird way of writing this.
Traditionally, and interestingly, the textbook does not touch this.
So, , the way we writing this, we don't
write equals between row operations because the matrices are not
equal.
Please do not write an equal sign between two matrices
as you row do a row operation, because.
That's.
Not right.
We tend to write arrows instead, and we to
label these arrows with what we're doing because as you
just found out, if someone just writes out some operations,
it can be quite hard to work out what's going
on and backwards engineer it.
So for everyone sake, let's write it out quite clearly.
And we do it in this really weird way.
We, , you cannot see.
There we go.
I will learn one day.
So in this first one, we took row two, and
we're saying the new row two is equivalent to the
old row two.
I've written this is half of the old row two.
So we do this really weird thing.
If we kind of say row two is going to
half of row two, but one's the new row two
and one's the old row two.
And then that gives us I'm not going to write
it out, but the matrix in one.
Okay.
What do we do for the second one?
Yeah, we swapped one and three.
So this one's a nicer way of writing it.
We just write kind of.
We swapped row one and three.
We just do an arrow.
There's no new old stuff.
What do we do for row three?
, vector matrix three.
It's not vector.
Art.
Yeah.
Row one and three.
So here.
Row three.
That's two.
Row three.
The new row three became row three plus row one.
You don't need to write old and new above them
each time.
I'm doing it to make it clear, but, .
Cool.
Can anyone actually work out how I got to vector
four?
I did, actually, that is sensible.
I didn't just pick numbers out of thin air.
Any ideas.
Yet?
You multiply the coefficients of the above.
Yeah, exactly.
I have no idea how you'd write that down, because
it's weird, but I essentially timed.
I made new row three old, rowed three times, row
two times in some.
Yeah.
, cool.
So that's.
, that's nonsense.
That is not an elementary row operation.
Please do not try times in rows together.
You can times them by a scalar we did
at the beginning.
But those are the three options we can swap.
We can scale a multiply.
And we can add those are three valid row operations
okay.
Are we all happy there.
Does anyone have any questions or thoughts.
Feelings.
Yeah.
Combine them.
Yeah, you can combine them.
Try not to combine.
I wouldn't combine swap with the other two.
But you could do a linear combination.
So you could say all three plus one half of
row two for example.
, but yeah, don't go crazy because.
The.
Your tutor has to mark your homework and they have
to be able to somehow work out what you've done.
.
So, yeah, try not to go too crazy.
Okay.
We are nearly at times, so I'm going to save
that for next time.
, we're going to do one more poll.
.
Slightly to help me design what to do.
, hang on.
I'm just going to change this poll slightly, , slightly,
to help me design what we want to do tomorrow.
But there were three topics.
How we feeling about those three topics?
Do we know what a linear system is?
Do we know when linear equations are equivalent or systems
of linear equations equivalent?
And can we carry out elementary row operations?
This is mainly to help me decide what we want
to do tomorrow.
We probably don't want to see the answers.
Let's hide the results.
There we go.
.
Oh, is there anything else?
Does anyone else have anything they really, really want me
to go through tomorrow.
I'm happy to feel free to come up to me
at the end.
, if there's something you want to do.
Otherwise, I'm going to give you an extra 30s there.
, yeah.
Thank you for coming.
I will see you tomorrow.
