Hello, everyone.
Can you hear me?
All right.
Yeah.
Good stuff.
Welcome to the revision lecture.
We have a fairly big room, so if you wanted
to, I would encourage you to come, , closer.
But you don't have to.
You don't have to.
Yeah, you can hear me as well.
I can hear how loud I am.
Okay.
So the way this is going to work, we have
prepared with the input of the piazza form and some
other input, some various examples, And you're also free to
ask questions about other things as well.
Yeah, but yeah, I'll be so I'll be I'm Erica,
I'll be leading this first hour and this.
Is I'm Kasia.
I'll be leading the second hour.
The first and second hour is going to be very
similar depending, but it depends.
If people have particular questions to ask, then it will
change a little bit.
All right.
So that's some good to everyone.
Straight if you want to ask.
No I think we'll do first example first and then
we can then we can take questions because then we're
kind of in.
Sure okay.
So I'm just going to find it.
Whoops.
Aha.
There we.
Go.
That's better.
And.
Okay.
So we have our first question.
And this is just a slightly modified one from one
of the quizzes.
So we have an n by n matrix and we
have a non-zero vector.
And then we have that this equation axe equals b
has a unique solution.
And we are asked how many solutions does the equation
axe equals zero have.
So if you were to be confronted with this kind
of question, which I guess you all have, and it's
been in one of the quizzes, well, how would you
start it?
It's a very big lecture theatre to be interactive, but
don't be scared.
Okay.
well, one thing that we can do right is that
we can just do doo doo doo doo.
We can start by letting V be the unique.
Factor and r n such that.
A v is equal to v.
Right.
And so this one we know that it's unique.
And since we're asked to solve this equation look at
the number of solutions.
Well we can just introduce a vector u.
So let you be a solution.
Two.
A u equals zero.
So now we need to somehow leverage this information that
we have.
And what we know about are matrices.
The kind of linear operations that they induce.
Right.
Is that they well they're linear right.
So does anyone have any kind of hunch on this
question what the answer should be, how many solutions this
equation should have.
Do we have okay.
Can we have a show of hands for no solutions.
Okay.
Unique solution.
That's a fair number of people.
Infinite amounts of solutions.
Okay, we have a few people.
So the consensus seems to be that it has one
unique solution.
And indeed, with the algebra, sort of what we can
do right is that we can use the linearity and
we can write a now of well, we already wrote
a V and a you.
What's left?
You can do a u plus b.
And you use the linearity.
So this is a u plus AV.
And now we can use what we know right.
A b is equal to b a is equal to
zero.
So we get zero plus b equals to b.
But what does this all mean.
Well, it means that.
You plus V is a solution.
To.
Axe equals b.
Right.
And so wit this information in hand.
Is it now going to be unique as it's somehow
clear.
Because so what we what would happen right.
If we had an infinite amount of solutions U to
our equation here.
Well what would happen is that then we have shown
that we would have an infinite amount of solutions To
our equation axe equals b here, but we assume that
this one was unique.
Right.
So we already know that this one, this vector, it
simply has to be v.
Right.
Because that was the only solution.
But if this is equal to v so what do
we have.
We have u plus v c equal to v.
Fairly simple equation.
Oh no.
Okay so we'll scroll down.
fairly simple equation.
You must be zero.
Now this is a very abstract and algebraic approach to
it.
So so what would you do.
Right.
If you looked at this and you're just , how
how do I even do this?
Where do I even start?
Well, one thing that you can always do when we
have.
If I scroll back up.
You've got a question on the second screen.
Oh yeah, I could.
That is wow.
So when we have these general efficient.
Right.
r m and r n as well here, what
we could always do is we could just let m
equals n equals two to make our problem simpler.
So I'll just make a little line here to denote
that this is now a new one.
So what would we have then.
Well we would have that our linear transformation goes from
R2 to R2.
And the benefit of this is that I can draw
R2 reasonably well.
I can maybe draw R3, But not that well.
So what we can do then is if we slide
this all the way up, we can have a look
graphically.
At what happens.
So I'll draw two copies.
Of our two.
And now I'm going to input some stuff here.
I'm going to put my B here.
I'm going to assume that it looks something that
maybe.
And then I'll put in my V the vector that
maps to B.
And we'll say it looks something that maybe.
So we have our map here between them.
To and it takes the vector v to the vector
b.
And now the second thing that I'm going to do,
I'm going to mark the origin in red here.
And I'm going to take draw r u.
Which is getting mapped to the origin.
Right.
So here this is one corresponding to to this equation
right here.
And so what we can observe here now is that
I have drawn a U that is not the zero
vector.
Right.
This is this is not the zero vector.
And so we can see kind of what happens.
Right.
Because we always know I'll go back a bit because
when we look at the solution right x equals zero
is always a solution to this thing no matter what
we have.
And so if the solution is unique, it has to
be the zero solution.
So but because I don't know exactly how to proceed,
I am going to say that it's a non-zero vector.
And then I'm going to see what kind of trouble
I find myself in.
And from that, see if I can kind of gain
some intuition about why it should have a unique solution.
And so we have a map and it's linear.
And what does this mean.
Well you had some properties right.
That you can scale things and that you can add
things.
But one thing that is going to do is that
it's simply going to take lines to lines.
So you goes to the origin.
And in fact the entire line.
Right here is also going to be mapped to the
origin.
Right.
Because we're just having we're saying that a U is
equal to zero.
And so that means that a of two is equal
to t, a u is equal to t times zero
is equal to zero.
So this entire line is going to end up getting
mapped to the origin.
All right.
So what does this mean for the solutions to axe
equals b i.e. what vectors are going to be mapped
to b.
Well I'll draw another one.
Right.
I'll draw this one here.
And I'll call this one here w and it's just,
it's just u scaled.
Maybe I should actually call it.
I'll call it properly, a scaling of you.
So I'll call it .
Yes.
You say okay and let's see how much space do
I have?
I have a bit of space.
So then what can we observe?
We can observe that.
oh.
Right.
No, that's the one that I wanted to name you.
I'll, I'll, I'll do it in orange.
So we have this vector here, right.
I'll call it w.
And we have w is equal to s u plus
v okay.
So then a of w is equal to a of
s u plus v.
And here again we can use linearity.
We have a Su plus AV.
And what do we know?
We know that AV is equal to B.
We know that A of s u is equal to
zero.
So we have zero plus b equal to.
B.
Right.
So we have that this vector here the blue one
also gets mapped to the vector b.
And so it's no it's not unique anymore right.
Because being a solution right.
That the solution is unique means that only one vector
can be mapped onto the vector p.
But it's not only that we have one additional one
here because there's nothing unique about this Su, I
can scale it differently.
So I can do that one.
I can do that one.
Well, okay.
It's just imagine that all of these are the
vector v.
My drawing is not that good.
And so what's going to happen is that this entire
line here is going to get mapped to the vector
b.
So because we have infinite solutions here to the axe
equal to zero, this line here we also get this
line with infinite solutions to axe equals b.
So that hopefully a nice illustration about how you
could gain some intuition about that.
I have been talking for quite a long time now.
So are there any questions on this example so far?
Yes.
I thought this.
Was the unique solution.
Why have we shown that?
Oh right.
Yes.
So so the question was we assumed that it
had a unique solution.
Now we provided an infinite amount of solution.
What was the point of all this?
And very good point.
So the point of all of this was to have
you be a non-zero vector, and then seeing that everything
breaks down right when we let it be the, the
non-zero vector, which would give us more than just a
trivial solution, that is x equals zero here.
Then everything kind of breaks down.
And so kind of what we done, we done kind
of a proof by contradiction.
Right.
So we suppose that.
So what we've done is that we assume that you
are.
Is it you not equal to zero?
Also under n solves.
A you equal zero.
And we have shown that this implies that there exists
infinite.
Solutions two.
To this one.
And so our conclusion.
Is that you will equal to zero is the only
solution to this equation.
Axe equals zero.
Does that answer the question?
I already forgot who it was that raised their hand.
Sorry.
Good stuff.
Any other questions?
And also any of the questions that you'd want us
to go over at this point.
Anything particular you want to cover?
Because we have a load of examples to do, but
if there's anything in particular anyone wants, we can do
that as well.
No specific requests.
Okay.
Well then I'll just do the example that I
to most.
If I can find it.
Assuming that you're taking it, you'll see these methods of
proof proof by contradiction properly in next semester.
Oh yeah.
Any questions about subspaces.
So basically spanning is that all these.
Are.
Subspaces and spanning okay.
so we have one question here that we can
do.
It doesn't have span but we can do one on
that as well later.
so oh yeah.
We can just move this here immediately and have this
one available for.
Right.
So we have the following question.
Are any of the following subspaces of R3.
So what do we have.
We have some kind of some kind of plane here.
Some kind of weird parabola thing here.
and.
Well, I think we'll get to them, , in turn.
So we'll just start with the, the first one.
, so we'll do a poll we did right
with the previous one.
So everyone who believes that this is a subspace of
R3.
No one.
Okay.
Everybody believes that this is not a subspace of R3.
Okay.
So the consensus is very clearly that it's not a
subspace.
And does anyone want to explain why it's not a
subspace.
Why does it not believe.
Oh there we go.
It doesn't go through the origin.
Right.
So we have a fairly quick solution here.
The origin does not belong to you.
So Q is not a sub space.
All right.
Now we move on to this second set here, and
I'll do the same thing.
So who believes that this is a subspace?
No.
Okay.
Who believes that?
It's not a subspace?
Okay.
We have a lot of hands.
So the consensus is clearly that this is not a
subspace.
And can I have a reason for why it's not
a subspace?
Yeah.
Even the.
So it's not linear okay.
So I would that to to make that a
bit more precise.
Right.
Because we have three axioms that it needs to satisfy.
Right.
Going through the origin we have the right the linearity.
So you mean the additivity, right?
Okay.
Right.
So what we can do right.
To see this is I'm just going to draw the
let's see what how does that is that explain.
So let this be the z axis.
I'll let this be the x axis.
And then you can imagine kind of the y axis
coming out of the page.
So what do we have.
We have a parabola.
And right so this is RV.
So do you have any concrete suggestions for which two
two vectors to add up so that they're no longer
in the set.
So the sum is no longer in the set?
Yes.
200.
001.
Okay.
And the other one.
Okay, 200.
So we have our example points.
And now, , where would these be on the diagram.
So let's see.
So it would be.
This would be here right.
And this one would be here.
So these ones are the vectors already.
Don't lie on the subspace.
Oh, no, it's completely fine.
, I would rather this is the.
I hope that this is a safe space to, ,
make mistakes.
Because making mistakes is how we learn.
, when I took this courses, a literal ton of
mistakes that I did.
And that's how we learn.
, we still make them now all the time.
Oh, yeah.
Even on material this, it's still easy to make
mistakes.
Even, , we literally , we we spent time before
this one going through the calculations of every example, because
we are not confident that we will get the calculations
correct on the spot.
Yeah.
Not necessarily.
, okay.
So going so I need two new vectors.
Yes.
Just take any two symmetric vectors in the parabola and
add them up and the sum is in the z
axis okay.
I mean take one in this side and another in
the other side, the reflection of it.
Right.
So you're saying take something 101 and visualise
it.
Yes.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Let's write down the vectors first and then we'll draw
them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we'll just .
On one side and the reflection on the other side.
Mhm.
Yeah.
So if we choose this point for example and
I just choose it because it's , I my
numbers as simple as possible.
And you'll have to excuse me that my parabola is
slightly deformed.
So it's, you'll just have to imagine that this is
one one and the coordinates.
, and then you said for the second one, we
just mirror it in the z axis and we go
Here.
All right.
And then when we add them up, I'll draw the
arrows as well.
It might be a.
Bit crowded.
But.
When we add them up.
How about that.
We've fallen outside our set.
And so now we immediately jump to the adding stuff.
, axiom.
But just as an observation, right?
We could also have used the fact that scalings need
to be, , contain still on the line because
example.
For example, if I take a point here, right, this
whole line.
Should be on and a subspace if it is a
subspace.
But clearly it's not.
.
All right, so what about now?
The last one.
So now we have this, , set w, , where
y squared is equal to z squared.
So we'll do the same thing.
, can we have a show of hands for the
people who believe that this is a subspace?
One two.
Okay.
And now can we have a show of hands for
the people who believe that this is not a subspace?
All right, so here we have a bit more disagreement.
And so I think for this one we'll do the
same thing.
And I'll I'll draw it out in a similar fashion.
, except that I'm going to let, I'll keep this
as a z axis.
And now I'll let this be the y axis.
And you can imagine the x axis going out of
the screen towards you.
And so what is this set going to look .
Well we can if we write our equation wow z
squared is equal to y squared.
So an obvious solution to this run rate would be
said equals y.
As there are another solution to this equation I heard
z equals minus y.
Okay.
And are there any more solutions.
Right.
So no no more solutions to this one.
So we have equivalence between these two.
And so what does it look ?
Well, this right here is a line, right?
It's this line in fact.
And this one here is also a line.
It's this line.
So this is our set W.
And with it drawn this I think I'll, I'll
do the polling one more time.
So who believes that this is a subspace.
All right.
Who believes that this is not a subspace.
All right.
So some people who, , some people have had a
change of heart.
And I believe that this is not a subspace.
So why would this not be a subspace?
It's not closed because.
011 and means or one way is what we call
home.
Right.
So you're saying that essentially we have a similar situation
to last time.
if I pick something here and I pick another
vector here.
And I add them, I fall outside the set.
So the thing that I'm going to encourage you to
do in general, which linear algebra, and I hope that
has been a clear theme so far, is to make
drawings where you can write.
And we've seen that even when you're given very
general spaces R2 and R2, then we can do
our little toy example with setting them both to two
just to see how things behave.
One thing that I wanted to observe about this one
before we move on is that oh, I forgot to
put the that.
It's the third one.
Is that this one will satisfy two of the axioms.
Right.
And we do have that zero is in the space.
And we also have that if v is a vector
in W then this implies that TV is in w
for all t in R, right.
Because the only thing that can happen essentially is
when I chose my vector v, it is on one
of the two lines.
And then when I scale it while I stay on
the line.
But as you pointed out, it still isn't closed under
addition.
And so it's not a subspace.
Okay.
, are there any questions on on this one?
No.
Okay.
, then I think we can move on to a
span question.
Do you have a good question for that?
I've got one here as well.
You did?
Oh, yeah, I yeah, if you have one good there
then.
, is it that one based on the previous one?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
, I might do the one with the.
So.
Right.
So here I.
Am, I think.
Well, in that way.
Yes, but I want to take, take this opportunity to
do the other one that I wrote down, but I
didn't write it down.
So we'll have a fun time with writing down the
question as well.
Okay, so we'll move this.
And so here we're going to have two subspaces.
We're going to have.
And V or no u.
Let's do a little u.
.
Where q is in R3 and we have v.
Where v is some arbitrary vector.
Okay, so which of the following.
Are true?
You as a subset or subspace of V.
V is a subspace of U.
He was not equal to V.
He was equal to V.
Oh, and it all fits.
How about that?
All right.
So I guess maybe we'll start with number four.
So are these going to be equal?
And we'll do the same I think.
, just a show of hands for people who believe
that they will be equal.
No one.
Okay.
Who believes that they will not be equal?
Okay.
Significantly more hands.
So why should they not be equal?
Do we have any reasoning for as to why?
Yes.
And they don't have to be prosecuted separately.
For example.
Or one day or one.
And.
One would be.
, one.
So your example is, , is.
That you would be .
Oh, we will be a different one.
Okay.
Zero.
, and then something else.
Okay.
I'll do a simple 101, one then.
We'll spend all of our time, but one will understand.
Okay.
Right.
So.
So the claim that we have is that, , we
don't necessarily have that you is .
Or.
Well, maybe we'll do that.
We don't necessarily.
Hmm.
I don't know if I'm spelling this word correctly, but
hopefully the.
Vibe is there.
Yeah, the vibe is there.
.
Not necessarily.
Equal to V, and this is the counter example that
we were given.
So then we would have span.
Oh, I'm, I am very much sorry.
There should be spans here.
Because that was the whole point of this question.
Right.
That we're going to be dealing with spans.
So just imagine that you was the span of these
things V is a span of these things.
, so right.
So then you would be span of 110.
101.
And T101.
And v would be equal to span.
110101.
And 011.
And then it was pointed out that this should be
equal to R3.
And so what did you say about the C2.
Right.
So it will be it will be a plane.
So you're saying that one of these vectors is going
to be redundant right.
So for example you have defined this third vector
right.
So that it's simply a scalar of this one so
we can eliminate it.
and we have.
Thus this is equal to the span.
110101.
And so we have the span of two vectors.
So we have a plane.
And then for v we have these three vectors.
And so what was your reasoning for choosing the third
vector.
What did you want for for this vector right here.
In this case we know that the dimension of x.
Okay.
So so basically what they said is that, , if
this vector here is linearly independent of these two, then
it's going to span all of our three, right.
Because then we have three linearly independent vectors.
So they're going to form a basis of R3, which
means that every single vector in R3 can be written
as a linear combination of them, which means that every
single vector in R3 is included in the span.
And so we conclude that it's equal to R3.
And clearly those two things are not equal.
Okay.
So now another question.
, moving on to the other thing.
Do we necessarily have that these are different.
Okay.
So we'll do a polling again.
So will these necessarily be different.
Show of hands for those who believe so.
Now on okay.
Show of hands for people who believe that they can
be equal.
All right.
That's a decisive majority.
So what is your intuition?
Why and what situation could these end up being equal?
Yes.
If the vector u is equal to the vector v
on the inside, it means that the spans are made
of the same vectors.
So.
Right.
So you're saying if we have u is equal to
v then.
We're going to have the span 110101V.
And v is equal to span.
110101V again.
And so yes.
Right.
Because then we even have that our lists are identical,
right?
They are completely identical.
And so they would have to be , and so
clearly the, the span has to be equal as well.
Okay.
So could I have a different counter example where u
is not equal to v.
Yes.
Use the multiple of v.
Okay.
So so in that case we would have TV here.
And so then the question is how can we conclude
that these are equal.
Well clearly.
T.
V is equal to t times v.
Right.
So we know that.
let's see what I want to have.
I wanted to be in that.
Right.
So then we have that TV is in the span.
Of V.
And oh but this is interesting okay okay.
Can I take any T here.
Let me just talk to you.
As long as it's not zero.
Right.
What what goes wrong if it's zero zero.
Right.
So you're saying that if we had, , v equals
to zero, well, then we would have.
Oh no, t equals to zero.
Whoops.
Then we would have u is equal to span.
See, I just wrote down V is equal to zero.
This is the kind of nonsense that we still still
do at our ripe old age.
And we have zero times v here.
And so you pointed out, redundant factor whereas v.
Oh yes.
Span 11010.
101 and v.
And so are these two.
Will going to be equal.
, can I have a show of hands to this?
Are these going to be equal?
Everyone who agrees with that statement hand up.
No one.
Okay.
, okay.
Are they not going to be equal?
Right.
I can't remember if I said the same thing twice
now.
, so the thing that I wanted to to note
right here, , is that they are going to be
different, right?
Unless what?
Yes.
Yes.
So.
I was going to say they can be, , you
can be an.
Independent, off to represent yourself.
You don't have to be the same.
Every person in both sets of linearly independent, but all
three of them.
All right.
So so here we had a very good, , good
input.
And I think we'll just hold that and get to
it after this.
So, so now I want to look at these two
sets specifically.
So I have , you in this case is the
span of these two vectors 110 and 101.
And we eliminated that one because it was redundant.
And v is equal to the span of 110101 and
v.
And so could it happen that these are equal.
If v is zero.
Right.
So.
Equal if and only if v is equal to zero.
But then I, I heard a very, very interesting thing.
Right.
Which is , that if we let V be different
from you and.
V110101.
Linearly independent and U110.
Well 101.
Linearly.
All right.
No, there was no point.
There was there was no point to this.
, so in this case.
Right.
, it was pointed out.
So if let's see it, remember the names.
So this was you, this was V, , that if
this is the case, then span V is equal to
R3 and span u is equal to R3.
Which means that you is equal span.
U is equal to span v.
All right.
There is more.
We can say in the previous case, if we go
back to what we did before.
Because what did we assume that we assumed u is
equal to v.
Right.
This is how we should.
, I mean for here.
So we assume that, , u was t times v.
But did we assume that, , u and V will
be, , independent of the previous two vectors in the
span?
That is a good question that we do that.
I don't believe we did.
Did we?
Just select.
It.
Should this be an F?
1 or 2.
That's exactly what I'm getting at.
All right.
So if I want to do my if and only
if.
I have to do.
This.
Span A110 and.
101.
That's the one.
Hopefully it's a ball.
I'll.
Move it a bit that.
Right.
Exactly.
So, so in order to have the if and only
if we need V to be in the span, because
then again, what is it that happens?
These redundant and we can eliminate it and still have
the span being the same.
Right.
So we're nearing the end of this revision lecture.
So are there any final questions.
You entirely welcome to stay for the second half is
the second hour as well.
Yeah.
All of the.
Parts were necessarily always true.
That are right.
So that that is a nice little wrap up.
so what.
Yes.
What can we conclude.
, so we said that this one does not
necessarily hold this one does not necessarily hold.
, and now For these ones.
What we have seen, right, is that one of them
has to hold.
Right.
Because all of our examples were they were made to
be different.
Right.
Was when we had that one of them.
That.
Oh okay.
We'll do this one then.
So all of the ones where they were different was
when one of them was the entire space, and one
of them.
Was the plane given by 110101.
And so you could convince yourself maybe after all of
these examples, that these are in fact the only two
possibilities for them not to be equal.
And so what can we conclude?
Well, we can conclude that you as a subset of
sub V or these a subspace of view.
So we don't we don't have any of the one
items.
But we can if we put a little more
here then we can do this.
At least one of those have to hold.
Yes.
Okay.
But I think that we will end it there.
So thank you very much for attending and good luck,
everyone on this synoptic quiz.
Did you get a lengthy a five minute break?
Essentially.
Then?
