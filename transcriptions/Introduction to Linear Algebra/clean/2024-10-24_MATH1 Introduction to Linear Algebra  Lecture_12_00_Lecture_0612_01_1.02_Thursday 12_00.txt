Right.
There we go.
We have a microphone and everything and a red light
so we can get started.
Is this microphone working?
It sounds it's echoing enough.
, so.
Ha!
Yes.
Welcome back.
There is another week of linear algebra.
, there is a lot of reading this week.
I am aware it's a whole chapter.
It's big, but hopefully most of it is not too
new.
Have most people seen factory stuff before?
I'm getting lots of nods.
Yeah.
Okay, so, , today might be a bit of general
revision for lots of you.
, it might be entirely new, and that's fine.
We're still going over it.
, but hopefully it's a bit less intense than it
maybe has been, particularly after last week.
So, , I am going to get rid of the
the login attendance code.
So if you've not logged into your attendance, you have
to use the code written on the board.
.
So the homework was released this morning.
The homework 303 was released this morning.
, it is due next Wednesday.
So that covers last week.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
And this week, vectors and planes.
, so that's that.
, and I don't actually think there's any other announcements.
It's kind of.
We're in Thursday's lecture.
Good.
Okay, so let us get started.
True or false?
If you have two nonzero vectors in r, n, ,
the coordinate tips, also known as the coordinates of the
vectors themselves.
Do they have to be the same?
If you have two nonzero vectors, they are equal to
the coordinate.
Tips have to be the same.
I am going to wait until we have at least
50% voting.
People are still logging on, so have a chat.
Let's see what we think.
It's wet.
Oh, look how it's wet.
I guess my shoes.
Were doing quite well.
, so I'm going to give you another 10s.
See what people think.
Okay.
Right.
So let us have a look at this.
We seem fairly divided between true and false.
So if you have two nonzero vectors at the same,
do the caution tips have to be the same?
, let's have a look at some comments.
Is that not the definition of a vector?
, yeah.
, it's not false.
Let's have a look at false.
Tips don't have to be the same direction.
Length vector can be translated from the origin, but is
still equal.
You don't have to start from the same position.
Okay.
So there were some other things.
Some of the comments we've had.
so let's try again.
Turn to your neighbour, have a quick conversation.
, try and convince your neighbour one way or another.
What are you thinking?
And then we're going to have another vote.
I don't think.
So.
No no no no.
Stop!
This.
Okay, I'm going to give you another 15 seconds.
Let's see if we can get over half of people
voting.
What are we thinking?
True or.
False?
Okay, let's have another five.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
, so we seem to have some of you who
have been convincing.
We seem to have moved slightly.
, we've gone from a kind of 5050 split to
a 3 to 1 split, which is movement.
, but that still doesn't quite seem to be consensus.
So let us let us see what we've got.
The chords of the vector of the quarter of that
vector starting in the origin.
So if x equals y then x I equals y.
, because the vectors are equal, the vectors are equal.
That is, that is the point.
, what are those people saying?
We've got a lot more common to it.
Only length and direction need to be equal.
The condition is not sufficient for them to have the
same tip, the direction that matters, not the coordinates.
I've had a slightly busy morning for the person who's
interested.
, same direction, length of that equal tale.
, okay.
So does somebody want to add to anything there any
other thing that they think I'm massively convincing?
This is why it's got to be true.
Yeah.
Why do you say that?
Because of the tip of the vectors are equals.
, don't you have to move both vectors so.
That they start at the origin?
Yes.
, well, no.
So if we think about when we talk about coordinate
tips, we're talking about I have a vector, I have
a tip and I have a you can't see.
That's a good point.
So I have some vector I have a tip I
have a tail , it is not true that your
tail has to be at the origin.
So bearing in mind your tale doesn't have to be
the origin, does anyone?
Does that change anyone's mind?
What are we thinking now?
Are those two vectors the same or different?
The same?
The same?
Same.
Anyone think different?
Okay.
They are indeed the same.
So they have different tails and tips, but they have
the same length and the same direction.
And that is all that matters for vector.
, you just want the same length.
And pointing in the same direction.
So actually this is a much more general definition.
Actually, I appreciate most of you.
You've probably seen this before, but let's just take a
moment to think about this.
So so you know, U and V are the same,
but also W is the same and W is over
here where there were no coordinates.
, let's see if I can do this.
Vector A is the same as UV and W.
That is not even that is definitely not got any
coordinates.
That's on a completely different sheet of paper.
In fact, , let's take this a step further.
Now I have to line this up.
This vector.
Isn't the same.
This vector is the same as all of those vectors,
but it's moving around.
There are no coordinates.
It's just a vector in space.
Which is why vectors are so useful, actually, because you
do not need to have coordinates and you don't always
have coordinates.
You don't always have numbers.
I'm sorry for those of you who came to study
university maths, hoping to do lots of calculations, but there
aren't that many numerical calculations.
, I appreciate that we've just done eigenvalues and eigenvectors
for a week, which were long numeric calculations.
, but that's not always true.
And actually vectors are one of these things we generalise.
So for example, lots of the research I do is
in tangent spaces to weird and wonderful wacky surfaces that
don't actually exist in three space or even Euclidean space.
And we can't put numbers on them because that makes
no sense.
But I can still work with vectors.
So vectors are wonderful because you can do loads of
fun stuff with them and you don't need numbers.
All you need is them to have the same length
in the same direction.
And you need one other rule.
You need to know how they how they how you
combine them so we can add them.
By what number haven't I got?
I've not got x the tip to tail rule, which
sounds a very kind of nursery rhyme maths rule,
but actually applies all applies way beyond numbers.
, you can always add vectors by moving them tip
to tail and then adding them up.
So this is going to be w plus x.
Cool.
Does anyone have any questions comments thoughts on any of
that.
Okay.
So .
Yeah all that matters is length and direction.
So bearing that in mind, I appreciate this.
May give some of you flashbacks to school, in which
case I mildly apologise.
, yes, it is false.
That is probably worth doing.
The answer is false.
It is not true.
.
The caution tips do not need to be the same
coordinates.
.
So I appreciate this.
May give some of you flashbacks, to which I mildly
apologise.
, but let's try matching the following.
So we have a hexagon with two vectors defined A
and B.
There are no coordinates here.
There are no numbers.
I am not telling you how big this hexagon is.
In fact, it looks very different on both screens.
, so can you match the following?
Can you find the vector a b?
Are we all happy with this notation?
A b with the arrow.
It was in the textbook.
It's basically just the fact that starts today and ends
a b.
, so let's try matching the following.
, you've got three vectors.
Four vectors.
To find some options.
Feel free to have a bit of a chat.
So.
There are just three options.
Two of these vectors are actually the same.
So.
Worth thinking about.
Okay I'm going to give you another 30s I think
until a bit longer for not halfway, but I think
we'll be halfway by then.
Okay.
Another 10s.
Right?
, so.
Let's have a look at this.
Lots of people voted.
We seem to have four matches that lots, if you
.
And then.
And then some other matches.
.
Which is good.
Yay!
The vast majority of you are right.
Hooray!
, yeah.
So if we want to kind of just a quick
example.
, a b is this vector from A to B,
, which is having based on what we said before,
is the going to be the same as each day?
And I can start at a, I can do minus,
I start at the point A and go along the
vector A negatively.
So it's going to be minus a and then a
long b.
So I'm going to add on b and I'm going
to have minus a plus b.
Or another way of thinking about this is what is
the vector b minus a.
Well it's the vector that goes along here.
And then afterwards goes , no, it's the vector that
goes along here.
And then afterwards goes down there.
And that's going to be equivalent O to C is
the same as A, B and D.
Cool.
Okay.
So we are good with vectors as kind of abstract
things.
There's no coordinates with a hexagon.
It's just an abstract line.
which is nice.
So it means we can do things however we want,
, in whatever space we want and we don't need.
We don't need vectors.
I've written here.
We can shake off the shackles of numbers.
I was obviously feeling poetic then.
, but yes, we're not constrained by our, , axes.
Cool.
Yeah.
So we have this parallelogram rule, which allows us to
add things, as we saw in that question.
We can also just change the direction by taking negative.
I could, , double it just by extending it double
the length.
All the things we want to happen, happen we
want to.
Okay.
So let's move on to a kind of maybe slightly
newer concept, , which is we were talking about length.
So let's talk about how we measure the length.
, and this is measured by the norm.
So the norm of a vector.
, and anyone know how we take the norm of
a vector?
What theorem are we essentially using?
Pythagoras.
Yes.
, we are Pythagoras using.
So one way of viewing this is is just the
square root of the first coordinate squared plus the second
coordinate squared, plus all the way up to however many
coordinates we're working in.
And the book talks about our two and our three
vectors.
But actually this holds for any size vector, however long
your list of numbers is, the length is still just
x one times x two times x one squared plus
x two squared plus x three squared.
, the other way we can view this is actually
as the dot product.
and again some people actually take this to be
the definition of of the norm.
Instead of saying it's how long our vector is.
They say it's the square root of the sum of
the dot product.
So bear in mind sometimes that's the definition.
Instead, we actually just have this as a result of
theorem 4.2.1.
It's part four of that theorem.
, that says we can actually just take the dot
product.
, why is the dot product?
Why are these two equivalent?
Why is the dot product the same as Pythagoras using
things?
Yeah.
If you think about what the dot product is, it's
time seeing the first entry of the first vector with
the first entry of the first vector, which is x1
times x1, which is x1 squared.
So yeah, we're doing exactly what we're thinking.
It's.
Kind of follows from the definition.
, good.
So here we're doing a bit of Pythagoras.
Let's think about some other, , trigonometric rules we know.
.
This one has lots of nice consequences.
Okay, there's my vector A and B.
What is this vector going to be?
Anyone want to tell me what my third vector is
to close my triangle in terms of a and B?
Good good good.
Okay.
So there is my.
It's a minus b.
Yeah.
This is why you should always shout to me when
I make a silly mistake.
, good.
Okay, so there's a minus B if I have this
angle here.
, who again?
This is probably something you might have seen before.
The cosine rule.
Yay!
Pythagoras corrected for all other triangles, essentially.
So, , let's actually write this in terms of a
minus B squared.
What is the cosine.
Will then going to tell me what's this equal to.
A squared.
Yeah.
Plus b squared.
Good.
2AB.
Yeah.
Cause it's the causal.
And then and then cos theta angle there.
Okay.
So that's the cosine rule again.
Hopefully this is a bit of a vision.
but I have written this down wrong.
So we two we need the norm of a, we
need the norm of B and then we need cos
theta because we want the length of these sides.
, so we need the norms okay.
So that is shown in the, in the textbook.
And a slight poof is given, but we actually
have a couple of results that are very important that
come from the cosine rule.
So the first one is of course sports inequality.
Cauchy is one of those mathematical mathematicians that if you
do enough maths, you kind of think, what did he
do?
There were so many things named Cauchy something or another.
I think I'll double check this, but I think he's
the mathematician with the most things named after him.
Pretty sure that's Cauchy.
, so lots of things named after him.
, and he has this inequality that says the dot
product is less than a b, , the norm of
A and the norm of B.
Can anyone tell me why my vertical lines are different
here?
That isn't me being silly.
, there is actually meaning there.
Y yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
So A and B are vectors.
So we need to take the norm of the vectors,
whereas HB what type of thing is HB?
It's a scalar.
So yeah, I'm taking the absolute value there rather than
a norm.
It's not a vector.
So those lines are correct.
Okay.
So we're not going to prove Cauchy-Schwarz because that is
quite similar to other things we've seen.
But we are going to prove the triangle inequality which
says a plus b.
The norm of a plus B is less than A
plus B.
, this is actually proposition 20, proposition 20 in Euclid
book one.
So we're going back to real antiquity maths here
and proving something literally in the original textbook.
, so this is a very well known, , inequality.
And actually, if you go on and do any other
kind of bits of maths with metric spaces and norms
and things that, the triangle inequality becomes very important.
, But the proof of it isn't too tricky.
So I thought we could do it together, actually.
And because it uses stuff we've already done.
So I'm going to leave that up there.
Hopefully.
, I think about this proof.
Okay.
What do I need to define?
Do I need to find anything before I get into
the meat of this proof?
What are we going to be working with?
So anything we don't, we need to tell the reader
exactly what it is a and B.
Yeah.
The only thing is A and B, , it's given
in the theorem.
So, , some people might say you don't have to
write it down again, but let's write it down again.
So let A and B be in RN.
So that just means it's a list of n numbers.
It's an n by n vector okay.
We then want to start at the left hand
side and work our way along.
So we're going to start with a plus B squared.
we'll start with a squared and then we'll show
it.
The square root will hold at the end.
Okay.
Any ideas about what I should use there.
What does that mean.
The dot product.
Yeah.
So always a good place to start.
A proof is with the definition.
So by definition that is what that means.
Okay.
What can we do next.
Expand.
Yeah.
So I'm going to have a dot a plus B
dot a plus a b plus b b.
And that's by I guess theorem 2.2 again.
Properties by properties of the dot product.
.
Okay.
Anything useful there?
Is a square feet of B square.
Good.
And we can collect them.
We can collect the middle two terms.
Good.
Why can I do that?
What property do they have?
It's one that begins with S.
The dot product is what?
Symmetric.
Yeah.
So a b equals b a.
It's a nice symmetric thing.
So a b and there's two of them.
So we're going to say by definition and symmetry of
the dot product.
Okay.
.
Right.
I'm going to give you a slight.
, yeah.
Okay.
What should we do next?
Can anyone think of anything that might help us here?
It is visible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
, so of course, is what inequality is going to
tell me.
This is less than or equal to, which is fine.
I'm trying to prove a less than or equals.
I'm not going to touch the A or the B
squared, but what's my middle term going to be less
than or equal to.
Good to a b.
Brilliant.
So this is by Cauchy-Schwarz.
Okay.
And then can anyone see how we can finish this
up actually.
We're on the last line.
Yeah.
Good.
This is actually a perfect square.
So this is the norm of a plus the norm
of B squared.
You'd then get a squared plus 2ABB squared.
Good.
And then actually if I take the square roots of
both sides I get the triangle inequality Quality.
Woo hoo!
So I can draw a little square and say I'm
done.
There you go.
There is a complete proof.
We defined everything we wanted we had to use.
We justified each step by saying what we used.
But essentially it was just one big calculation.
, and that proves triangle inequality, which is quite a
fun thing.
Cool.
Any questions on that or thoughts.
Yeah.
On my last line with somebody please.
, so.
This equal sign here, this thing here is exactly equal
to that.
So we are going to keep the equal sign there.
But we've proved overall this thing is an equal to
this thing.
It's less than or equal because we made the less
than or equal assumption there.
, that's a good question though.
I mean, yes, you could put a less than or
equal sign there, but it's just always equal.
So you probably should put it in equal sign.
Okay.
Anything else?
goes.
Hokey pokey.
, so, , let us return just for a second,
then to the cosine rule and look at a third
consequence of the cosine rule.
, what happens if, , my angle is pi by
two?
What does that mean for.
These two things.
So one of the things we saw in the textbook
we got from here was that the the a, b,
we could rearrange the cosine rule and get the norm
of A times the norm of b times cos theta.
So if my angle is pi by two.
What is my dot product.
Yeah.
Zero.
Yeah.
So this is a kind of big thing about orthogonality,
which is how many people have heard the word orthogonal
before this week.
Okay.
Some of you.
How many people have heard the word perpendicular?
Okay.
Most of you.
, so you've got to love maths.
You learn a technical word and then we upgrade it.
Perpendicular gets upgraded to orthogonal.
They're essentially the same thing.
, they just mean the angle is they're at a
right angle to each other.
So if you are perpendicular orthogonal, we will talk a
lot more about orthogonality in the rest of the term.
, if your particular orthogonal then your dot product has
to be zero because your angle is pi by two.
And we know that the dot product is given by
the norms times cause.
Okay, so let's do one more question.
, that's not the question I wanted.
This is the question I wanted.
, so you cannot see that, , A, B and
C are going to be unit vectors with a b
equals zero.
So a and B are orthogonal.
Can you find can there be a way of
writing a plus b plus c equals zero.
So if you think about that that means you're going
to follow the three vectors around and end up back
where you began.
So I'm going to give you have a chat with
your neighbour.
Let's see how long we have here.
But can you have a b plus c a plus
b plus c equals zero.
If a b equals zero.
Okay.
We're half.
We're not halfway.
Let's try and get half way a third of the
way.
I'm going to give you another 20s.
Oh, we reached the halfway point.
Okay, 10s.
Five seconds.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Okay, so.
Oh, this is interesting.
50% of you say no.
And then we seem a bit split between.
Yes and sometimes.
So let's see what.
Let's see what they sometimes say.
When c equals minus a plus b.
Yeah.
If c equals minus a plus b then yeah that's
definitely true.
Good.
What about a cannot be zero.
Depends on the vectors.
.
, given there's no condition for C, we could just
let C equal that.
.
If c is the hypotenuse, if c equals zero.
, okay, let us look at this.
Because I be orthogonal.
I mean, the other person said if they were orthogonal
to the hypotenuse, it still works.
, because the unit vectors length would need to be
two unit vectors have angles between 2.3 possible for non
unit vectors.
So all of the people for know mention something about
length.
Why does does length matter here?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because these are hypotenuse and it is always greater.
Okay good.
So actually lots of everyone.
Everyone all the comments were very correct.
Everyone was saying good things.
I'm a bit sneaky.
I'm snuck in a word and didn't really, , yell
about it, but it makes a big difference.
, it is true if they are not unit vectors.
Because then yeah, you take C to be the hypotenuse.
You take C to be minus a minus plus b
minus a minus a plus b.
, all everything everyone said was correct.
But if we're unit vectors then it doesn't work.
We are breaking.
You're essentially saying you've got a unit vector here with
length one, a unit vector here which is orthogonal with
length one.
And you have a unit vector here with length one
that should you write that should be length root two.
, so yeah, it's true, provided I didn't sneak in
the tiny little word unit.
, so yeah, be careful about quantifying words such as
unit.
, what would the angle have to be if I
had three unit vectors a, b, and c and they
formed a triangle, what were the angle?
Have to be 60.
Yeah, Pi by three.
, what.
Yeah.
Because we then have three equal sides and we need
an equilateral triangle.
Good.
Okay.
Are we all happy there?
Any questions?
Comments?
Yes.
You know, if if there what are we.
And so maybe.
So even if you were in higher dimensions, , then
you would still be forming a triangle and Pythagoras would
still be holding.
You might be having n dimensions, so it might be.
A triangle that.
Right.
I mean, this is what?
So kind of in a sphere this.
, then if you added them together, you would buy
the top and tail rule.
So if I've got three vectors, the top top to
tip rule says I can add them together by moving
one of the vectors to the top of the other
one.
So if those are my three unit vectors in the
sphere, even if I moved them to the tip, I'm
not going to end up back where.
Yeah, I'm always going to be three vectors are always
going to lie in at most three dimensional space, and
it definitely holds for two and three dimensional space.
Pythagoras still has to hold.
Pythagoras holds for any dimensions, so it's still unfortunately doesn't
work even in higher dimensions.
Anything else?
Okay.
So we're going to change topics slightly and move on
to straight lines.
So again hopefully this is something lots of you
have seen before.
There are five equations of a straight line.
There are five equations.
Some of them are straight lines.
which ones are straight lines?
.
Some of the following are straight lines.
Which ones are straight lines?
Have a chat with your neighbour.
I'm going to give you a bit longer to do
this one, because some of them are a bit harder.
As.
A.
Result of.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm going to give you 30 more seconds.
Getting lots of voting in about two thirds of the
way there.
I'm going to give you another 10s.
There was lots of good discussion.
Five seconds.
Three seconds.
Two and one.
Okay, so, , we all seem to think the first
one is a straight line, which is a relief.
, yes, the first one is a straight line.
That's your classic y equals x plus C.
That's your probably the first way you saw a straight
line being written.
So yes.
Oh good.
We also seem quite happy that the second one is
two.
This is a game probably something a form you saw
at school.
, yeah.
So this is possibly a form you saw.
, I didn't know you could do that.
That's quite fun.
, did lots of people see that before university?
Equations that look that?
Yeah.
, it's another common one that we have.
, yeah.
You're right.
Changing my Y to a Z doesn't change anything.
, one thing I will say for both of these
is, yes, I've written them in terms of x and
Z, but actually Provided you rename your variables correctly.
Those would both also be straight lines in however many
dimensions.
Even if I had dimension abcd, xyz all 26 dimensions,
the equation y plus four x plus six would still
give me a straight line in 26 dimensions.
I probably wouldn't call my dimensions abcdefg.
, but I could , and that would still be
a straight line.
And similarly for two names are kind of slightly arbitrary.
Yeah.
Higher dimension in higher dimensions.
, yeah.
Okay.
You're right.
In high dimensions, you would also actually need the additional
thing of saying all the other dimensions were equal to
zero.
, so it would be that equation plus in three
dimensions for example z equals zero.
but yeah it would, it would define a line
provided all the others were fixed.
, okay.
We then seem slightly split between 3 and 5.
Remarkably similar voting there.
, what are we saying there?
They all are.
Maybe, I mean, guess.
Good guess.
, parametric form for 3D line.
Parametric form?
Yeah.
So if we think about this, this is actually a
form we've seen loads of, , if I click on
this, does it get big.
No it doesn't.
, this is.
That is the same as me saying x, y, z
equals t times because someone else read the numbers from
behind me.
What's this vector going to be?
Good.
And then what am I adding?
Perfect.
That is the same as that.
It's just instead of writing it case wise, I'm watching
it as a vector and hopefully by now we all
happy that that gives us the vector equation of a
line that is the one we have seen probably the
most in this course.
How to write a straight line.
So good.
, those are equivalent.
, five I threw in for fun.
, when you go, when you call, you get x
and Y.
Only two dimensions.
Yeah.
So, , this is a form of a straight line
that I hadn't actually really come across until I started
looking at equations of a straight line.
But if you do that calculation, if you expand out
that determinant, you're going to essentially get if you think
about, , the top row, you're going to get X
times some determinant 2119, which is just going to be
a number plus y times some number.
A plus one times some number equals zero which
is the same, which is well really similar to a
kind of y equals mx plus c equation.
We've just got x times the number plus y times
the number plus a number.
Cool.
, I've still got five minutes.
I don't know if not, when did the time go?
Whoops.
Okay.
Good point.
We're out of time.
Indeed.
