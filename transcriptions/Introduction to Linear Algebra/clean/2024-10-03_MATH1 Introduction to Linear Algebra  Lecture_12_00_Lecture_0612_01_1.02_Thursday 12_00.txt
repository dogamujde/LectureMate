Right.
Okay.
So as you see, the lecture recording has started.
I just want to make you aware that that clock
there is three minutes fast.
So I'm not going by that one.
Anyhow, I just want to make you aware before I
start.
I've been asked by my peers to display this here.
It's a group of second and third year students who
are sort of wanting to pair up with first year.
, and discussing Ila helping them with Ila.
These are students who've been in your shoes, , last
year or the year before.
And it can be quite useful.
, especially if you sort of think you could do
with more help.
I will include that slide in the set that I'll
upload on the webpage.
, later this afternoon if you haven't had a chance.
, also, those are the attendance poll for this week.
, Thursday we do the attendance poll.
, if you're missing this.
, I've got the coat there because I'm going to
change that Start now to display my lecture poles, which
is a different code.
Right?
Okay.
So after that, , linear algebra again week three.
, so the topic we're doing today is actually two
relatively different topics that we're doing today that we're doing
this week first elementary matrices today and then linear transformations
tomorrow.
The elementary matrices , to some extent bridges the gap
between week one where we did Gaussian elimination row operations,
, and week two where we did matrix algebra.
, and we're going to see that you have seen
from reading that this is pretty much two sides of
the same coin.
, they're really the same thing.
We're trying to bridge the gap and seeing the connection
there.
, but before we get there, , not this one,
just to sort of have a warm up, , this
sort of hangs on from last week.
, one poll, , that I didn't manage to do
that, but we will see that something that we're
going to need later at least an extension.
So I'd you at the moment.
, so I just need to quickly go stop this
here.
Oh, no.
I actually can keep this up.
I just see I've done this cleverer than I thought
and go.
, so we've got four choices.
Reset.
, and I think I can display that one minute.
Indeed.
Right.
Okay, good.
Okay.
Almost time up.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
.
Halfway between.
Halfway between A and B.
Okay.
So, , good that I do that.
, I'm just going to.
Well, then giving this back to you, I'm just going
to do this, , on here.
So I'm asking you once this comes up in a
second.
What is a B transpose?
, and the transpose of that.
, so there's a couple of rules now that we
have to play with.
At the same time, the first thing to notice is
that this sort of transpose on the B, it's only
only applies to the B nor to the A.
So this is really sort of write it as a
times B transposed and the whole thing transposed.
, now if I transpose the product of two matrices,
I actually need to change the order of the matrices.
And I think that's the bit that the people who
thought, , that answer A was right had forgotten.
So I need to change the order of the matrices.
So I have to say this is B transposed And
the transpose of that times the first matrix A here
and again the transpose of that.
And then I can of course use that.
I know B transpose.
Transpose is just the matrix B, so this is B
a transpose.
Yeah.
But do remember that we need to change the order.
That's the important bit.
And that's the reason actually why I'm doing this and
why I'm reminding you because we're seeing that later.
, so that was answer B.
, a related thing now in terms of using several
rules is what would you do if I ask if
I had three matches this year?
And I ask you to say, what is A times
B times C and the whole thing transposed?
, anybody's got any suspicions?
What did you see?
Transpose.
Times B.
28.
That's the sort of obvious thing you'd assume.
Yeah, you change the order, so it must hold for
any amount of matrices.
How would you prove that, though?
I guess you would do A, B, c transpose.
So do you that?
I said.
Yeah.
Yeah I know that's correct.
And you could do it either way.
You can break it down.
You're perfectly right.
I could write this as a and then b c
and transpose it.
And then now b c is sort of one matrix
which don't need to give a name.
It's just a matrix.
But we're just a product of two matrices.
So we can do this as b c transpose times
A transpose.
And now we we leave the A transpose there where
we can now do with a, b, c transpose.
Again flipping the order there so it is C transposed
B transposed A transposed.
, now question is what is it with four matrices
or 5 or 6 and so on.
And the suspicion, of course.
It'll just carry on.
But you would have to prove it.
And you can't really prove it for any possible number
of n.
So there's something called , , there's something called induction
that you can use.
So proof and problem solving, you might have seen this
in school or proofs and problem solving in semester two
will go further into that.
But I just want you to remind you of that
and also tell you the same rules apply.
If we had inverses instead of transposes.
, and , as I say, we're going to need
that , later.
Right.
Okay.
, so what do I want to do after that.
So ba transpose was correct.
, okay.
So let's get on to what we're doing today.
Elementary matrices.
, so the definition that Nicholson gave was the following.
, and I'll just go with that.
An elementary matrices is a square matrix.
that can be obtained from the identity by a single
elementary row operation.
A note that is given this definition at the moment,
not that, comes later.
It's the matrix that is equivalent to a row operation.
But it's just saying, , if we can obtain it
by a single elementary row operation from the identity, then
it's an elementary matrix.
Well, and we just to remind you, we had sort
of three types of row operations.
Type one is just swapping two rows.
, type three.
Type two is multiplying a row with a multiple with
a with a scalar.
And type three is adding a multiple of one row
to another row, , or rather replacing one row by
that row plus the multiple of another one.
, actually, in this case, the replacing operation is just
as important as combining them.
So you have to You have to replace the correct
role for this to work.
, okay.
So , next poll now that we have the definition
question is which of these matrices that I've got here,
, are elementary matrices.
That's not elementary row operations, elementary matrices.
So again, , give me a second and I'll display
the poll again.
Oh.
Oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry.
Back, back I did that.
, there's more than one.
, there is more than one.
And I need to give you a poll that allows
you to give me more than one answer.
So there we go.
Sorry.
.
Second try.
Okay, a few more seconds.
Right.
You say A and C, , and I believe indeed
those are the correct answers.
A few people say also B so , D is
out.
, because I said it had to be a square
matrix.
D is obviously not square.
, , although sort of you, it's just swapping two
rows from.
But you do need a square matrix.
, so the other is , matrix A yes.
I'm multiplying, , the third row by two matrix C
yes.
, adding five times the first row to the second.
, matrix B , if you look closely, you realise
there's actually two row operations that are in here, one
after the other.
, so, , it's both swapping rows one and two.
, and also more deploying the third row by two.
, so it's a combination.
It's not an elementary matrix.
The elementary matrix is really just obtained by one row
operation from the identity.
, okay.
So that now leads us.
, so A and C were the correct ones there.
, that leads us to the sort of, , relation
this house with Gaussian elimination.
And Nicholson has this lemma here.
, if an elementary row operation put this on both
here.
, if an elementary row operation is performed on a
m times n matrix, the matrix we are performing that
on doesn't have to be square.
, the result is the matrix E, where E is
the M times M square.
No elementary matrix corresponding to that operation.
, now, I don't know how you .
When I first read that, I had to read that
about three times to understand what Nicholson actually meant by
that.
So let me paraphrase that a bit.
So what is it saying is the following.
, if I've got a matrix A here, and I'm
performing an elementary row operation on that matrix to get,
, the matrix, a dash here.
, and then I say that this elementary row operation,
, corresponds to the matrix E.
Well, then I have that.
I could also get a dash here by taking E
times a, , or even a little bit more explicit.
, so if I say if I have an elementary
row operation, , and I'm going to call this R
here now performed on a matrix so that by this
row operation, I'm transferring the matrix A into the matrix
E dash.
, this thing that the matrix E here should correspond
to that row operation means by what we had earlier
that if I apply the same row operation to the
identity matrix here, then I'm going to get the matrix
E that's the elementary matrix.
, then I also have that a dash here equals
to E times a.
So we've now got a link here , between, on
the one hand, the row operations that we've done in
week one and the matrix algebra that we've done in
week two, that they're really just two sides of the
same coin.
And that's very, very useful.
Know it a might be useful if you want to
do something implement Gaussian elimination on a computer.
, although you wouldn't actually do that by , by
multiplying matrices together.
, but , also this becomes quite important for theoretical
trying to prove some theory or understanding really what Gauss
elimination does.
And also the character of matrices.
We'll do a little bit of that today.
, right.
Okay.
I think at that point I was just to complete
the whole thing.
I was just going to go back to my example
here.
, and just to, , sort of just in case,
, say, well, we've now let's check that this works
here.
We've got this matrix C here, , 1511.
And we certainly obtaining that from the identity matrix by
adding five times the first row to the second row.
Yeah.
Now let's see whether that works.
Yeah.
, so we've got this matrix C here , which
is 111000.
and we've got a five there, 500.
, and we are moving the applying that from the
left by just a general three by three matrix.
So let's call this just a b c d e
f g h I.
Yeah.
Okay.
, let's go on.
, so first element here a this first column here
times the first row will give us me and a,
indeed I'll have the same thing for the complete
first row here.
This times.
This will just give me the B this times.
This will give me the C.
, now this column here times that row will give
me A5A plus one times D plus d this times
that will give me five b plus e times
one times e.
and then I'm going to go to five C plus
f and then finally, this column here times
that row is going to give me the G.
, and the same for the other two.
I'm just going to get H and I back.
, and indeed , it's a bit off there.
, indeed.
We see what we've done here is just adding five
times the first row to the second row and replacing
the second row by that.
Now.
So this was , r two is replaced by five.
, by sorry by R two plus five times R1.
Yeah.
Okay.
So , let's do a little bit more on that.
, so I've got a few more matrices here that
I just learned, a few row operations that these could
be, , and I'm just asking you to match them.
So, , we've got a matching poll here.
Matching down here.
And because it's a little bit complex, I want to
give you two minutes there.
, you are right.
Okay.
And, , just play now.
Okay.
That should work.
, so my matching poll here.
All right.
Wait.
Okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I need to start again.
.
I should be able to reset this here.
All right.
Okay.
Well, we just have to do with that.
Why can't I not reset this?
Okay, we'll just have to carry on with that.
All right.
Okay.
The police life.
I'm going to give you two minutes.
Okay.
Results are coming in.
All right.
First minute.
Solo.
All.
Right.
All.
Right.
Okay.
We're almost.
At the end.
Right.
That's it.
So most frequent answer.
So people think that see matches to for it's
the most frequent one.
And indeed that sort of swapped rows one and two.
And that is C people also think that E
matches to one E matches to one.
So.
Right.
Okay.
, so how do we get the one there from
the identity matrix adding twice the second row onto the
first one.
Yeah.
, adding twice the second row onto the first one.
, correct.
, a doesn't match anything.
Well, we keep with we leave it, , with a
a is the one that is left over.
, B matches to true.
, so B cells multiplying second row by two be
matches to two.
, slightly surprised that that wasn't the most the second
most popular one.
And then finally D matches to three D matches.
Do not have that.
Just that they all are changed.
, no d d matches to three.
So adding twice the first row to the second row.
, okay.
And a is the one that is left over.
, good.
Okay.
So, .
That's fine.
, recognising elementary matrices.
, we will have another one.
So this is all square matrices at the moment.
So what do you think.
So there's the matching , the correct one.
I think that's what we just had.
, so good.
, so, , what is the case if I'm applying
this to a matrix that isn't square?
, but I've got.
This one here.
And I need a poll with three choices.
I've got a timer, not multiple answers.
Oh, I thought they reset, but it's hidden down there.
That's where the reset is hidden.
Okay.
Three choices displayed.
Excellent.
There we go.
Okay.
, almost at the end.
Right.
B and indeed B is correct.
Yeah.
So, , it's obvious that what we've started swapping rows
one and two, , and all of these three things
have somehow swapped rows one and two.
The question is just what is your starting point.
And you're swapping you've got two rows here.
So your starting point has got to be something.
And I mentioned two.
And we have to have a square matrix to start
with.
so B here is the correct starting point in
order to swap rows one and two.
Right.
I did stress that.
See here that we can't have but we have to
have square matrices.
Otherwise I thought at beginning that it seems quite logical
that you want something to match the dimension.
But no, you want something a square matrix in the
row dimensions.
So last thing on the sort of just playing around
with elementary matrices.
, so all elementary matrices are actually invertible.
, which is a nice property because all elementary row
operations we can reverse, we can do the opposite.
So let's give you an example here.
So I've got this matrix either similar to what we
had earlier.
And I want you to know what is the what
you want you to tell me or think about what
is the inverse of that.
And I'm hoping you that the inverse actually is by
just replacing that five on the bottom left corner by
a different number.
But what should be the number you want to replace
it with?
.
Five choices.
Reset.
And play.
No.
Sorry.
Right.
Okay.
, it gives you the time, I guess, you know,
to, , , two minutes.
I only want at one minute.
Really?
I stopped this after one minute.
Okay, ten more seconds and then I'll go to the
results.
So the votes are coming in and you can keep
them coming in, but I'll show you the results.
, and most people have said B, which indeed turns
out to be the correct answer.
But now the question is, I mean, I am n
two to, , I am n to remember all of
these inverses and no, you're not.
I mean, I don't know them.
I wouldn't have been able to tell you offhand which
one of those is the inverse.
, but you should know how to work these out
by first principles or so, and I just want to
quickly go through that.
So what we're wanting here is that we say we've
got this matrix.
, right.
, so what's our matrix?
One, one, one and a five down here 00000.
, and we want to find the inverse.
So in other words, we want to find a matrix
here, , such that if we multiply that, we're going
to get the identity.
, , so now, of course, I could try playing
around and then saying, okay, this is a matrix A,
B, C, D and so on.
, and let's sort of make a system of equations,
see whether I can work out whether zeros are, ,
what it should be, or I can take the hint
and saying only actually I need one element there.
, but I can do it in a different way.
So I'm pretty more deploying here with something that I
know is going to be an elementary row operation.
So an elementary matrix and I want to do is
such that this here becomes the identity.
So from what we've done before, all I need to
work out is what row operations do I have to
do on this matrix here in order to get the
identity?
Well, so how how does that work?
Which row operation is the right one?
Becomes all three minus five times a one.
Yes.
So I can't get that to the identity.
If I replace the third row, , with the third
row minus five times the first row.
Well, so what I need to do is I need
to replace the third row, , by the third row,
minus five times the first row.
, and if we applying this here, the elementary matrix
corresponding to that is indeed, , starting with the identity
and then just five times minus five times the first
row added onto that is the minus five here.
, that should be it.
And you can now go through and just check that
this indeed holds here.
So one times one gives me one, one times this
one or the ones on different locations.
So it all cancels.
This one here I have a one times minus one
plus one times.
Sorry one times minus five plus one times five.
Cancel.
It gives me the zero.
And you can go through that this works, but
just sort of playing a little bit with what we
know about elementary row operations.
Okay.
So that's sort of enough about this sort of algebra
and how the whole thing works and how we recognise
them.
, let's time to have a little bit of what
that tells us about the nature of matrices.
, what we've done so far.
So the first thing is, , I was wondering why
why are these things called elementary matrices?
So is it this guy that says, this is
really elementary?
There should be really, really easy.
And that's why the elementary matrices, it's just it's just
a simple thing.
, you might think so, but I don't think that
that's what why it's called elementary matrices.
Rather, I think what we've got here is something
that.
Yeah.
You can think of elementary matrices as something Lego
blocks.
These are the building blocks of anything else of any
other, actually any other invertible matrix.
, and we will see that this sort of final
result really of that session.
So that's what, , elementary means in this case.
These are the building blocks of other matrices.
Yeah.
, yeah.
There are, there are this sort of most, most basic,
most simple elementary, , invertible matrices that you can think
of apart from the identity.
But really, I think it's the building blocks.
Okay.
, going into that, , I've got another poll which
is now getting a little bit more that you need
to think about what's going on here.
, so suppose we've got the following situation.
, I've got A and B are matrices such that
I can get from A to B by elementary row
operations and saying I need a sequence of row operations,
not just one a sequence of k row operations.
, and I denote by e1, e2, e, k the
matrices that correspond to these row operations.
, so that means somehow I must be able to
write the new matrix B as something u times
A is something multiplied from the left times A.
Now it's just not a single matrix.
It's a sequence of matrices.
What's the right thing to do here for you?
Well.
.
Not multiple answers.
And the time I display.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
, ten more seconds.
See, is what most of you say.
And indeed, , that is the correct answer.
, and again, , we can sort of get there,
, by thinking, , so what do we have?
, we know that we're going to get our matrix
B, , from the matrix A.
, by somehow multiplying from the left.
, and now what do we do?
, we saying, first of all, we going to apply
the elementary row operation E1 to it.
So we're going to start with, , applying E1 to
that.
, and then so this becomes the new matrix here.
And after that we are applying E2 to that, ,
and so on.
And then E3, , and we carry on until finally
we apply e k to the whole thing as the
last row operation.
, and of course, , this is now lots of
brackets.
We know we can, we can re bracket the whole
thing.
We can write this here as EQ times, times E3,
times e2 times E1, , and that whole thing times,
eh?
, and then, , this here.
, the combination of all these elementary row operations, we
can just call you, .
And that was the answer.
The answer?
See?
There.
Okay.
So, .
How do we get this to you?
.
And again.
, so what I've shown you before.
, so this here, , this is really was from
a theorem 2.51 and Nicholson.
, and the theorem actually did have a third part.
, so here's the theorem again.
, so, so a suppose that A and B are
matrices such that you can get from A to B
by row operations.
, then we know that we can write B as
two times a and we've got a representation of
U.
That's what we've just done.
And also Nicholson says the following that indeed we can
compute you by, , oops, doing this here.
, what we've known for the, , or what I
showed you as the algorithm to correct to, to get
inverses.
, so we can start with an augmented system here
that we have the matrix A augmented by the identity,
apply row operations to A, so that we're going to
get to be , at the same time the identity
matrix here would be transformed to you.
, and I showed you that last time as a
way to, to get the identity as a sort of
this is just the magic trick.
, why does it work?
, and we now know or have the, , half
a bit of an understanding and know why this would
work.
Let me just check that.
, I'm not ahead of myself.
, so what we're saying is basically the following, ,
that we're saying that if I've got my matrix A
here.
Yeah.
, and I say I can get by elementary by
some row operations.
So I'm going to call these row operations.
Are you here?
, so if I take this here IU, I'm going
to get as the row operation, , the corresponding to
the matrix.
You I'm going to get to matrix U a and
this matrix here is b this is what I
call b.
So I'm going to get from A to B by
row operations.
I these row operations I call ru and you
as the sort of combination of matrices that corresponds to
that.
Yeah.
That's the setup there.
, if I now do and say I'm going to
apply a same row operations here, , to the matrix,
I to the identity.
What I'm getting to is also you times I know
and just this gives me the matrix.
You.
And that indeed is what this is saying that if
I the same row operations that take A to B,
if I apply them to I , that will give
me the matrix U.
, and of course you could ask the matrix B
that you wanted to get to.
You could choose the identity.
, and if you're doing that, , this will now
give you the proof that indeed what you're getting out
of the process, in the position of you there is
the inverse of the matrix you started with.
Now, , think about that.
, that just said, this is the reason why the
whole thing works.
, and I think let me just check where I
am at the moment.
.
I'm totally sure I might.
Right.
Okay, let's let me let me just do that.
I don't want to do an another example on this.
Did I, .
Yeah, I did one two.
Right.
Okay.
So, , let's just have another example on the whole
thing.
, keep this up here and say, let's say I've
got matrices A is , one, two, three, four and
the matrix B is six, 812.
Yeah.
, so , have a look at these.
, and I sort of, , you should see relatively
quickly that you can't get from A to B by,
, two actually row operations.
, and let's just try this sort of algorithm.
So we've got one, two, three, four and we say
we want to apply the same thing here to the
identity matrix.
So can anybody tell me a row operation that will
get me at least in the right direction?
What should I do?
So for a one row run it were two.
Yeah.
Let's start with that one.
That at least gives us here.
So if we're swapping that , so R1 swap with
R2.
, that will give us a 3412.
We're doing the same thing on the identity.
So this will give us A0110.
Right.
Okay.
, and the other operation, what else do we need
to multiply?
Row one by two.
Indeed.
So row one gets replaced by two.
Row one.
, so this will now give us six, eight one,
two.
On the other hand 0210.
Okay, so this is B , we got there.
, and, , so this here is B, this here
is, you know, , and we can now check that,
, u times a equals to be, you know, ,
I'm not going to do that here at the moment,
but it's the whole process at work.
You take those matrices, multiply them out, convince yourself that
this actually does work.
, okay.
, just to warn you, you may very well get
something this exercise that a heart here in a
quiz or in a, , synoptic assessment.
So it's a, it's a popular, , it's a popular
thing to ask.
Right.
Okay.
I say this also applies to the identity.
Okay, so we now know how to get from A
to B by elementary row operations.
And what this does with a matrix view.
The question is can I always go back.
So once I've done that I have a way from
A to B with a matrix view.
Do I know that I can always reverse that.
So what do you think?
No, sorry.
Why does this not work?
Have I've forgotten?
Reset.
Reset.
Display.
Yes.
Okay.
It works now.
By 10s.
Majority think it's always and indeed it is always.
So and again just just quickly sort of talk you
through the argument, , why this would be the case.
So we have seen that if we go from a,
, to be elementary row operation, , that means that
we know that we can write B as you times
A, we use invertible, you know?
.
So you as this sort of, , combination of elementary
matrices.
, now, of course, we can now multiply the whole
thing by u minus one to give us that u
minus one b equals to a.
Yeah.
Multiplying from the left by u minus one.
Or this tells us that a equals to u minus
one b.
So again we have that.
Now we can get we can write A as
an invertible matrix times B that looks okay.
The only thing that we have to think about is
we know that this u here , u here was
a , was a combination of , a product of
elementary matrices.
So this is e k times e2 times E1.
, so what is u minus one.
, and this is what I said earlier.
, so u minus one obviously is this whole thing
here, , inverted.
, and now we know how to get that.
We get that by just changing the order.
So this is E one minus one times E two
minus one and so on.
Times e k minus one.
Now each of those here, , it's the inverse
of an elementary matrix Which we know is also an
elementary matrix.
So again, we can write a as a sequence of
elementary matrices applied to be.
In other words we can get from B to a
m.
Okay.
So to summarise that if we have something that we
say if it's something this is symmetric, that we
go from A to B and means we can get
from B to A if and only if we call
this an equivalent.
And in this case we can say that two matrices
A and B are row equivalent.
If we go from A to B by elementary row
operations, and that implies we can also get vice versa
equivalences.
Again, not necessarily in this case, but equivalence is again
is something that you will see a few times.
So to finish the whole thing off, I've got one
last, , last poll here.
, which says that, , I've got an n times
n matrix.
, and which of these conditions that are half here
is now equivalent or is now equivalent to that?
The matrix A is invertible.
That is a bit of what we had last week.
, and a bit of what I've done just now.
, this again will be a poll, , where I've
got multiple choices.
So I'll just set this up.
And it would have a choice this time or one
minute display now.
Okay.
All.
Right.
Ten more seconds.
Okay.
Right.
Okay.
We're not quite clear.
B and D are the most favourite, but you're not
sure, so let's look a, , , it's really equivalent
to matrix and reduce alone form.
That's not enough.
Actually, every matrix is equivalent to a matrix in row
echelon form.
If it's an invertible matrix, it'll be actually be.
It's equivalent to the identity.
So reduced form is not enough.
part C it is an elementary matrix, while
every elementary matrix is invertible, but not every invertible matrix
is elementary.
Yeah.
, rather, .
D is correct.
, every elementary matrix is a every invertible matrix is
a product of elementary matrices.
Now, , b I should say is correct as well.
B follows from what we have from the inverse
theorem we had in the last lecture.
, for every right hand side there is a solution.
And also we have been shown that this solution is
unique.
I just want to summarise this.
just one more slide that says the last point that
we have out there, and a square matrix is invertible
if and only if it is the product of elementary
matrices.
So I've got a representation that I can write every
invertible matrices as a product there.
And I to think about this as the Lego
theorem.
It tells me indeed that every invertible matrix I can
make up by using elementary matrices as my building blocks.
I should add to this that this representation there are.
The product of elementary matrices is not unique.
There are several ones of them.
So this really works more Legos again where you
can build something in various different ways.
, rather than say prime numbers where the product is
unique.
Right.
Okay.
That's it for today.
I'll see you tomorrow again, where we do something quite
different.
