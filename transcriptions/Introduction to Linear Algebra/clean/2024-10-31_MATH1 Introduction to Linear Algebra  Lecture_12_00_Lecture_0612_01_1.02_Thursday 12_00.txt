Right.
Okay.
, the right lights on already.
, so welcome back again.
, to my part of Isla.
, so before we start going.
A couple of announcements.
, first of all, I've been asked to advertise this
event here.
, and I'm sure you've seen other posters about.
I don't actually know any more about it, but I
just put up this, , this slide there.
, the other thing I want to say.
Or we've got the attendance poll here.
, I keep this up for a little bit.
, please do take part in it.
, and then finally, , thanks to everybody who's taking
part in the mid-semester feedback poll that is closed now
last week.
At the moment we are working through that, looking through
all the replies you've given us, this is very valuable
for us.
, and we will later this week or beginning of
next week.
, post the reply to all the points that have
been raised and, , how we are taking these on
board so we haven't forgotten about it.
You will get feedback.
, but we are just working on it at the
moment.
Right.
Okay, so having said that, I'm going to go back
here and , which we're on.
Am I going to do that?
I think I'm going to start maybe, , doing this
on this here while keeping the attendance poll up for
the time being.
Right?
Okay.
So for the content of this week, , I've got
sort of two topics that are very closely interlinked, which
is really just one topic that I'll just need two
lectures to go over it.
So, , today we're going to look at first of
all subspaces.
And then we're going to look at spanning and spanning
sets of a subspace or office space.
And then tomorrow we're going to go into talking about
linear independence and dimension.
And I think that's the title that Nicholson gives to
that topic.
The one the other important part of tomorrow is going
to be the concept of bases, what they are and
how they span subspaces.
So we're developing into that concept there.
, now before I go into that, probably I want
to start let me see, where do we go?
.
All right.
I did have something.
Oh, there we go.
There we go.
I had something to dim the lights a little bit,
but you can see it, right?
Okay, so I set, , as the reading for this
week, chapter five.
And then just really just one page of chapter six,
which was this one here, which was sort of all
axioms for vector addition and vector and scalar multiplication and
so on.
You might thought you, you might think to yourself, what's
the point of this?
How should I really read this?
Because you can read this as just saying, well, these
are just obvious rules of how to work with vectors
that we had all the way back in week one.
There aren't all this stuff we've gone through that we
know how to work with vectors.
Is this just a reminder?
And no, you can read this the other way around,
because so far in everything on most things that we've
done, we've worked with vector spaces being r, n, b,
r 2 or 3, or maybe in RN, but it
was always , vectors built out of numbers in
the real in, in the real numbers.
But actually the concept goes much further.
We don't need to think about vector spaces, something in
R RN or something that.
We can try to apply the concept to something completely
abstract or something completely different.
And then the question becomes somehow, what?
What are the rules of the game?
, what do I need to have from some abstract
concept in order to call this a vector space?
And this is really what these are.
These are sort of rules of the game that I
can say, rather than saying, well, my vectors, , have
these properties, I can go the other way round and
saying anything that has these properties I will call a
vector space.
And then once I've got that, I can say that
most of the things we've developed so far in, in
particular, this sort of more abstract stuff that is coming
this week and next week will apply to this object,
whatever it is.
As long as I know that I've got these properties
there now.
So I could term for example, I mean, I could
literally go and say, I want to calculate with apples
and bananas how I call these things these fruit,
I call them vectors.
As long as you define to me what you mean
by taking u plus v, what you mean by apple
plus a banana, and what you mean by saying if.
What happens if I multiply my apple or banana by
a scalar?
And if as long as you can do the whole
thing consistent so that it satisfies all these properties, that
it's going to be a vector space, and I can
do all my stuff where there's an everything that I've
done so far carries over.
So this is again sort of an example of that.
I say we're going to go away from working with
concrete objects, real numbers, and going more and more into
working with their properties.
So a little bit more, more concrete.
What are other things that you are working with?
The obvious thing is that Nicholson says these are functional
spaces.
So these vectors u and v I could think about
as a function general function.
Or if you want to do a little bit more,
more, more concrete polynomials, for example, know these are obvious
things that I can write.
Think about this and they will satisfy all the properties
of a vector space.
And these are concepts that come quite often.
Other things will be matrices rather than vectors.
A little bit looking the same as vectors, or just
have larger larger area of numbers.
But again this is something where that would apply.
So that is just the background.
And apart from this I'm going to go right back
to our N and keep there for this week and
next.
But you will have these concepts coming up now.
So just remind just as a reminder that we've got
this as well.
Right okay.
So let's go straight into subsets and actually well not
quite into the first problem I do that in a
second.
So I've got a set this here now.
And it's probably worthwhile at this point.
And I'm just going to say a few things about
the notation, because Nicholson introduces that and is quite often
used, and it's probably quite useful if we talk about
this, I'm going to get away from the, , from
that pole there and talk about notation.
So if I'm talking about sets, right, I'll do the
other way round actually.
Sorry, because I can't see what I'm writing otherwise.
Give me a second.
There we go and there we go.
Right.
Okay.
If I'm talking about sets, , so I can write
down a set as having a set bracket and then
list all the elements that I have.
So for example, I can do something two, four,
six.
Yeah.
And say this is the set of , those numbers
in particular.
, quite often I can't really list all the elements
in a set.
, so I can do something, , which Nicholson calls
the set builder notation.
.
So, , I can do something that, that I
can say.
Right.
I want the set of all say n in n,
so all natural numbers.
, then I put a condition on it, , so
that, for example, I can say n is divisible.
By two.
, end of the set.
Yep.
So in this case for this notation I've sort of
got a base set here.
, and also have a condition here.
, and in the middle I've got this, , vertical
line there, , that is usually pronounced as such that.
Yeah.
So I can read this as this is the set
of all n in the natural numbers such that n
is divisible by two.
So set of all or even numbers.
.
Some people use a different notation.
For example, instead of a vertical line.
Here, some people just use a colon.
, that's just perfect.
Personal preference means the same thing.
Pronounce the same thing.
, and I can have a slight variation on the
whole thing.
, that, for example, I could say something this
is the set of anything that I can write as
two n, , such that n is a natural number.
Yeah.
, of course, that would be the same set in
this case.
, and sometimes one or the other, , is more
natural of trying to write the sets.
, so just as a reminder, what is meant if
I write something this.
So in this case, I'm going to look at the
set here.
, of all vectors in r n , I'm going
to call this set.
And this is not the natural number.
This is just a set called n.
So all vectors such that for a given matrix A
times x is equal to zero.
So the question is this set.
Such a set is that a subspace or is that
not a subspace.
And right now at this point I will need to
switch things over.
So , I'm going to go and give you the
pole here.
And I'm going to go this here and bring up
a clip.
, right.
Okay.
Do you.
Know that I have a three choices here?
, I researched these, , It added, , I am,
I know, multiple answers.
Okay.
This play now.
No.
Do you need a reminder?
You might need.
But how do I do that?
All right, there's my lecture polls.
Oh, and you don't see the other thing, right?
Right.
We've got that.
We've got this.
.
And, .
Probably.
Okay.
We are.
I've got 40.
But I'll show you the results.
Okay, okay.
Sorry for that.
.
And sorry for those who haven't been able to vote
is because they didn't have the poll.
, but I get I get to that in a
second.
I'll just play that in a second.
Okay, so most of you think this is always a
subspace.
, and indeed it is.
, I'll tell you a little bit more about it.
In fact, this is what is called the null space.
, and if you have anything we've seen that,
, a times x, a multiplying with a vector is
a linear transformation.
And indeed any linear transformation asking what elements are mapped
onto zero, that is going to be a subspace.
So what happens if I do this slightly different.
, if I say now consider the set of all
elements, all vectors which are mapped onto a vector b,
, where b is not the zero vector.
So is this a subspace or is this not a
subspace?
And , again I'm going to go back.
I'm going to reset this poll.
, I'm going to start this.
And while you're doing that, I will try to display.
This here.
So that you can take part.
All right.
20s.
Right.
Okay.
So, , end of the time, let's have a look
at the results.
Right.
Okay.
So you're much less clear about this.
So just about most think that is never a subspace.
Something almost the same must always.
And something this depends on something.
So probably at this point it's worth looking at.
Actually, water subspace is going back in and seeing
what we know about these things.
, okay.
So , right, okay, let's just keep this up here
and let's have a look, , at my subspaces.
Right.
Okay.
So a subspace, , I'm saying is a set of
vectors, which in principle could be any set of vectors,
, is a subspace or if the following are satisfied.
So I've got a couple of axioms.
, one being zero should be in the subspace, one
being that if I've got x and y in the
space or in the set of vectors, then , there
are some is also in the subspace, , and the
other one, if I've got an x in the subspace
and a the scalar and scalar times.
this awesome subspace.
So in other words, we're saying that this space should
be closed with respect to vector addition and scalar multiplication.
Just adding to vectors or more deploying a vector by
a scalar.
It's not going to take me out of that subspace.
Now that should remind you of something that we have
done previously.
, if I just go back here, , namely, ,
linear, the definition of linear transformations.
, so there's a certain certain, , relation between the
asymmetry between that here as well.
We've looked at sort of where we're saying we've got
X and y elements of a subspace or element of
a vector space.
We're looking at what happens to x plus y, what
happens to axe.
, so there's a certain symmetry here with the axioms
two and three.
And indeed one way of doing this, of thinking about
subspace, is that this is anything that you can define
the concepts of linear transformations on.
You know, in order to be able to check this
here, if you've got X plus y, we need to
be able to at least say that x plus y,
we can do the transformation on it all.
So we're not not looking at actually what it does,
but just we need to be able to evaluate our
transformation x plus y.
And the same thing if we look at the second
one, if we multiplying it with a scalar, we need
to be able to evaluate that.
So to some extent these things that we've got there
are the conditions so that we can talk about linear
transformation on a subspace at all.
A subspace is something where we can sensibly talk about
whether something is a linear transformation or not.
So one possible application might be something if you're doing
computer graphics and you're not doing this stuff and the
whole run, but you now wanting to do, I don't
know, a rotation or something on a plane.
, in in MN.
Yeah.
This is a subset of that.
And he wanted to think, are these things linear?
What are the relations?
How does it work?
There are in order for being able to do that,
the space you're working in must be a subspace.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Now, , if I've got this sort of symmetry between
that, you notice that one thing isn't symmetric.
Namely here I've got this axiom one there that says
zero has to be in the subspace.
And here I'm not saying anything about zero.
Yeah.
And indeed we've noticed when we've done that there that
we don't need to say anything about zero because that
just follows from those axioms.
Yeah.
I can use for example, the second one then saying
let's set a equal to zero.
And I know that helps me that t of zero
has to equal to zero.
So can we do something similar over there.
Can we just derive, , that first thing there from
the others?
, what do you think?
Anybody thinks we can do that over here?
Is that.
, if you assume a certain minus x?
Yeah.
Okay, so if we had x in the set and
minus x in the set, we could do that.
Do we know that minus x is on the set.
Yeah a can be minus one indeed.
Yeah.
No it does work doesn't it.
So we can do something , .
What do I need to.
I probably don't want this here a laptop.
Go to the camera.
.
Just give me a second so I could do something
saying, well, if I've got an X in my,
in my subset there or my space there.
, I know that, , minus one times x, ,
must be in the space.
Yeah.
, minus one times x, obviously is minus x.
That must be in the space.
Yeah.
, by the third axiom there.
And if I've got those two, then I've got that
x minus x.
, so that's just the sum of two elements on
the subspace.
, this is the zero vector that's also element on
the subspace.
Yeah.
So it does seem to work.
It looks that the first one there, , just
falls out or the other thing.
So does that make the first axiom here redundant?
Could I just do it without.
Could I just what I've done in the sorry I
haven't got it up there.
The linear transformation that I just have axioms two and
three.
Right.
Any anybody wants to say whether they think this is
redundant or not.
Or in other words, does one action, one that tells
us something that the other two don't tell us.
Up there.
As one.
Only to assume that an X actually exists.
Yeah.
Exactly.
That's the reason.
So you need to assume in order what I've done
here.
I need to assume that an X are actually half
an element in my set.
You know what it does include what it does exclude.
The whole thing is that I couldn't have the empty
set with all the other things.
If I just have two and three, then just having
the empty set would be a subset.
There's just simply no element.
So anything anything holds.
, but my first one there says I've got a
half an element.
And now, because I know that if ever I have
a subset, zero has got to be in the subset
by what I've just done here.
, it's natural to to say that I've got a
zero in the subset.
So an empty set is not a subset.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
So, , now that we've done that, that we have
some idea now what subsets are , it or subspaces
or sorry, I shouldn't call subspaces.
There are different subsets.
, that I talked about subspaces.
, I should probably go back now and can track
the conditions.
So, , what does happen if I go back here
and, , look at this set that I had at
the beginning.
Right.
Okay, I've got that there.
So can we now say something about that set?
.
Right.
So why is this?
Why is this a subspace?
, so we've got the set here, , of all
vectors in RN, , such that a x equal to
zero.
Now everything works the same if I don't expect this
axis to be in RN, but sitting in any vector
space and more than eight times x, I'm looking at
any linear transformation.
That's sort of the the beauty of it.
I'm doing it concretely or relatively concrete, but you will
see that everything happens in the more everything works in
the more general setting.
So let's have a look at my subspace axioms.
So what do I need to prove?
, first of all.
So S1 does that.
How Howard.
As one says, it's zero in the subspace.
So I need to check what happens if I apply
A to zero.
So a times the zero vector is the zero vector.
So indeed that holds.
Yeah.
So zero is element of the subspace.
So I should write the zeroth element of n.
So next thing I want to show s two
is if I've got two, , if I've got
x and y in n, , so if I've got
x and y in N, , then I know that
because they're in the subspace, I know that axe equal
to zero.
And I know that a y equals to zero.
Right.
Okay.
So now I want to take what happens to x
plus y.
So x plus y in order to see whether
that's in the space, I need to multiply it with
a, , and see what happens.
, now I can take this apart a x plus
a y.
I know this is zero.
I know this is zero.
So this is zero plus zero.
, and that's a zero.
So, , x plus y.
So I have here that x plus y is also
in n.
Well so that worked.
, and then finally, , I can have a look
at the third one.
So I've got X in my space or in my
subspace and a scalar.
, so that means , as before.
, if x is in N, , I know that
axe is equal to zero.
, and then I can have a look at what
happens to axe.
, again, I can multiply it with a to check
what the result is.
I know that I can take the A out here.
So this is a , times a x.
, I know that a x is zero, so this
is a times zero.
, and that is zero.
, so again this is part of the subspace.
So okay.
So , we've checked all the axioms.
, so we've proven that, , this set that I've,
, haven't got here anymore, that that is indeed always
a subspace just come straight out of the properties of
linear transformations.
Now, .
Now that we know a little bit about subspaces, let
us look again at this one here.
, and , first of all, before we weren't really
sure what's happening.
So are you clearer about that now.
So let's just go back, , and do the same
poll again that we hard reset and display.
So if I have the right hand side equal to
zero, is this a subspace or is this not a
subspace?
Right?
10s.
Okay, so you're now much clearer about that.
This is never a subspace, which is indeed the right
answer.
Can anybody give me a quick reason why this cannot
be a subspace?
Yeah.
Zero zero would not be part of the set.
Indeed.
Yeah.
And that's a that's a quick, quick check for a
lot of things.
So again, just to , just for completeness, .
So , if I've got this set here.
, my set B, which I've now defined as x,
all vectors in our n such that a x equals
to b.
And I want to check that.
, so my first property there that I had was
I need to check whether zero, is sorry, whether
zero is part of the set, , or it is
not.
But I just want to check that that is the
case.
, so I need to check what happens if I
apply a to that.
So if I say a times zero, , that is
zero obviously.
, and zero is not equal to b.
, we said b up to B, not , not
part of the not not zero.
, so zero isn't in that set.
So this cannot be a subset.
Yep.
So that's a quick quick and easy check here.
, so let's go further trying to recognise subsets or
subspaces.
I keep saying that wrong subspaces.
Okay, so here are a few.
Subsets of R2 given geometrically.
And I'd you to tell me which or any
if any of these are subspaces, not just for each
of them.
I just want to tell me the number.
How many of these do you think are subspaces?
I've got five choices.
And it's only one correct answer.
I give you.
I'll give you 1.5 minutes on this one.
That's.
The whole thing is.
Right.
Okay.
Last 10s.
.
Good.
Okay.
, 1 or 2 is what you think?
, pretty much.
Even so, there's one set where people are unclear about,
and I suspect I know which one that is, but
let's let's go through them bit by bit.
, so, .
Right.
Okay.
Let's have a look at this.
So first of all, the first set is just the
circle, right.
Subspace or not subspace anyone?
No.
Why not?
That doesn't have zero in it.
Yeah, we just set that zero.
That's a quick check.
, actually, I can also do another one.
I can also say, well, if I had a vector
here, this one here, if it was a subspace, ,
if I scale, that vector would still have to be
in the subspace.
Yeah.
So if I did something this here, , that
should be in the subspace.
Isn't.
So this isn't a subspace.
Yeah.
Okay.
, second one.
What did I have?
, this one here.
Line.
Just the line, not through the origin subspace are not
subspace.
No, you're not saying.
And indeed, I'm not asking.
, same counterexample is previously.
Yeah, zero isn't in the subspace.
And indeed sort of drawing a vector here.
I can't scale the vector.
That doesn't work.
So not a subspace.
, I'm going to do this one first.
Just the origin.
Yeah, just the vector.
Zero, zero.
Nothing else.
Is that a subspace or is that not a subspace?
It is.
Yeah.
, so because a similar with zero, I can I'm
not going to I wasn't going to check the,
the things.
No, I'll just keep it as that.
So this is, , this is a subspace.
So I suspect the one that people found confusing was
this one here where I just have the x axis
and the y axis.
So, , subspace or not subspace.
I think this is the one where we were half.
Half.
So you think not a subspace Y?
Not.
Second condition.
Second condition?
Yeah.
, if I've got two elements in a subspace, their
addition has also to be in the subspace.
And indeed, that doesn't hold you.
Yeah.
So you might think here, because zero's in the subspace.
And if I can scale any vector, I can.
That would still be in the subspace.
, but if I have something this, here's my
vector x here.
And that one here is my vector y.
, then this here, that one there would be the
vector x plus y.
, and that is not in the subspace.
Yeah.
Right.
So if they're not in the subspace.
Now.
I could try to add things to the set to
make it into a subspace.
So I could add this vector x plus y into
the subspace.
And then probably all its multiples I need those as
well.
Yeah.
To make some sort of star.
Is that a subspace?
No, no, I can still combine stuff.
How much would I have to add in order to
make this into a subspace?
Sorry.
All of our two.
Indeed.
Indeed.
I would need to add all of R2 now.
And that's a that's sort of what's guiding us for
the next for the rest of this of today is
what do I need to add onto some spaces in
order to make it into a subspace?
Yeah.
, and indeed.
, I can now go and say the following here.
, right.
Okay, good.
Ignore what I have on the back there.
, now, I've got two elements here, x and Y
in my subspace.
Yeah.
.
And I want to.
So what?
We have to include a path from x and Y
to make something into a subspace.
I know that at the very least, I need to
have t x and s y.
, must be also element of the subspace.
So I need to be able to scale them by
any, , scalar.
And I need to be able to add things together.
So I need to be able to have t x
plus s y.
, need to also be in the subspace.
In other words, I need to have sort of all
linear.
If I've got two elements in my subspace, I need
to have all linear combinations of these elements both in
the subspace.
And indeed that sort of thing has a name.
I'm going to skip this pole.
Right.
Okay.
That is called the span.
And it's quite fitting that we do the whole thing
on Halloween.
I think , this back there that spans something
which is a thing.
So a span if given, given a set of vectors,
the span is just the set of all linear combinations
of these vectors.
Yeah.
, and , right.
Okay.
So what do we know about the span then?
, well, the first thing is that given a vectors
and the span and I'm going to call this just
to take me, I'm going to call the span just
u.
We're saying the set U here as a subspace of
RN.
So it is a subspace.
The span is a subspace.
, and so probably shouldn't be all that surprised.
That's how we that's how we constructed it.
Yeah.
In order to be for it to be a subspace.
But we can say more about it.
So there's this statement here.
Nicholson.
And again, I think this is one of the ones
that you sort of have to read a couple of
times to understand what this is saying.
So it says if I've got another subspace of RN
that contains these vector.
So I'm defining the span.
And then I'm taking just a random subspace that happens
to contain the vectors.
And I'm saying that the span actually has to be
part of the subspace.
So in other words what this means is that the
span U there is the smallest subspace that has all
these vectors in it.
So it's going to go back to what I said.
What I said earlier, , with a with a cross
there.
What do I have to add in order to make
this into a subspace?
The span is exactly what I have to add.
Given some vectors.
The span, it's the smallest possible subspace that includes these
vectors.
Okay.
And I think I'm going to play a little bit
with a span.
Yeah.
There we go.
So , what is the span of those two vectors
over there.
, and just give you a little bit of a,
.
Just give you lots of options.
Give a little bit of sort of a geometric thing.
So we're talking about we're talking about this vector here.
That's one one and this vector here that is one
minus one.
, sorry, not quite 45 degree angle.
So are we.
If the span just the zero vector, the x axis
both acts that the triangle with a corner point.
So that would be the sort of triangle , in
this here, , the square with a corner point.
So that would be if I make this here into
a square, , and take this one here.
Is that that one, , is just the cross shape
union.
So that would be if I just make this sort
of into into something that.
, or is it actually the whole of RN and
that's got if I count correctly, you've got seven options
there.
So I'll give you a poll with seven different options
for that one there.
Seven choices.
Nope.
Sorry.
That's the wrong one.
.
Seven choices.
Seven choices added.
, not multiple answers.
Timer display.
Excellent.
Up to G.
Right.
So which is it?
Not showing you the pole is another 10s.
Right.
So most people, at least two thirds, think gee is
the right answer, the whole offer, and indeed that is
the or the whole of R2, and indeed that is
the correct answer.
, now there's a few people here who thought F
or e or D, , so f f can be
a subspace that is sort of the cross thing.
We've heard that before.
Yeah.
, D and E, I understand where you're coming from.
And I think in this case, you might be confused
by my.
You might have been a little bit confused by my
bad picture there.
, that's sort of how does something that that's
misleading actually.
So it's really it's not just anything.
So remember that if I've got something, if I've got
something in my subspace, then if I scale that, it's
also got to be in the subspace.
So it can't be anything that is sort of that,
that is sort of has a limit to that.
It has to go in all directions up to infinity.
And if you do that, you will get the whole
of R2.
, the thing that I had there, the other two
possibilities there, , so particular number D that what is
called the convex hull of these vectors, let us also
consider that will in various causes is important.
, but we're not getting that through through the span.
So this is not the span indeed is going to
be the whole of are two.
How do I see that.
So can I just I just want to quickly
show that here.
, so, , the claim here that I have, ,
the claim is that, .
Right.
Where do we go?
Yeah, that the span, , of one one and one
minus one here, , is indeed the whole are two.
, so how do I show that?
, I show inclusions in both directions, so I hope
you believe me that if I say that the span
of these things here, there's got to be a subset
of R2.
Yeah.
Can't really go out of R2.
So I need to show I need to show that
R2 is a subset of the span.
Right.
How do I do that?
, I do that by taking any vector in R2
and show that that is also part of the span.
So I can show that by saying I can take
any vector x and y in R2, , and show
that this is , part of the span.
, so what does it mean that it's part of
the span?
, it needs a need to be able to write
x and Y as the linear combination of the vectors
in the span.
That was the definition.
So I need to be able to write this as
one one plus s one minus one.
Yeah.
, now there's various ways around that and the sort
of sake of time, because I still need to cover
one thing.
I'm not going to do that.
But you could, for example, realise that what you've just
written down here is a linear system of equations with
s and t as my variables.
So I can now check whether I know whether this
is got a solution and it does have a solution.
Always think about that.
As I say, I'm not going to do that at
the moment in the interest of time.
, just one other thing.
So what happens if I had this here?
So not half 111 minus one, but I've got one,
two, one, three here as my elements there.
So there's no these look much closer together here.
, 13123.
So this one here and that one there.
Something that.
What is this?
What's the span here?
Anyone.
It's still the.
Hole.
It's still the hole of R2.
Yeah.
It doesn't really matter whether they're very close together.
So if they were parallel, it wouldn't work.
But as long as they've got enough information, it'll span
the whole of R2.
Okay, so, , there's a little bit here of, ,
right.
Notate or , language.
, so this banning it might be a bit confusing.
So we say that if you've got the set X
here that that spans the subspace, you , we say
also that X is a spanning set for you.
And you on the other hand the span of x.
Now a little bit sort of a not not really
exactly.
But you can think of X as a sort of
generating set for the span for the subspace.
And now it quite to know a little bit.
We'd quite to know a little bit about sort
of the relation between the sort of generating set, the
X and the set that it spans.
, and so I would you to look at
the following.
The following example.
I'll give you a poll there in a second.
Assuming that we've got three vectors u, v and x
x, u and v are three vectors that are half
and are now going to look at the span of
two of them, x and u, and are also going
to have a look at the span of x and
u and v.
So nothing more said about these vectors, just that I've
got three vectors.
And I'm going to look at the span of two
of them, the span of three of them.
Now the question is what?
What do we know anything about that.
And in particular, I'd to think and this is
the this is the poll that a half, I suppose.
, we could have it in such a way that
actually the span of those is the same span of
X and years, the span of x, U and V,
so V doesn't add any more information.
So the question to you is a could that be
could that be the case.
So you might think that this is not possible.
So answer E the situation is not possible.
Or if it is possible what do I know about
u and v.
What must how it must it be that the new
vector v is actually one that I have there already,
or multiple, or just the linear combination or something completely
different?
.
So.
Five choices.
Okay, I've given you set this up to be in
a minute and a half.
, we might just about half a minute and a
half.
All.
Right.
Okay, a.
Few more seconds.
Right.
Okay.
So most of you say then it has to be
linear combination, not any of the others.
And indeed, that is the correct answer.
, and since it's relatively clear in the interest of
time, I'm not going to spend much more about it.
I'm just going to sort of summarise the situation.
, so we're wanting to know the, the sort of
the relation between a set of space and its
and its generating set.
What, its span.
So the vectors that span it.
And we seen that we've seen already that a space
can have different spanning sets.
I had two possible ones for two.
, we now see that it might be possible to
actually include a third element that we still have the
same spanning set, the same set that is spanned.
So we don't even know, , it doesn't even have
the same number of vectors.
So that situation is a little bit unsatisfactory.
You know, that we don't really we'd to have
something a bit more that we say, this is if
this is a generating set, we'd to be able
to say a little bit more about it.
, and indeed, , that, that, that what we've just
had on the pole seems to suggest that some elements
of the spanning set can be superfluous, can be redundant.
Question is, can we identify them?
Yeah, and that's pretty much where we're going to start
off tomorrow and taking this further.
Right.
Okay.
That's it for today.
, talk to you tomorrow again.
Thank you.
