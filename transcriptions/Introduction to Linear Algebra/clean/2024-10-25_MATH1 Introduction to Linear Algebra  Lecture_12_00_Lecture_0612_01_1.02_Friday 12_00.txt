And we have a red light to go.
Hello.
It's Friday.
Of week six.
Do you know why this is a particularly special Friday?
We are now over halfway through your first term.
Yay!
It's nearly time to.
You just got to repeat what you've done once, and
then you're done.
, for your first term.
So, yes, we are halfway.
Hooray!
, and we are continuing on from yesterday, where we
ended by looking at the equation of a straight line.
And we found that there were lots of ways to
write a straight line.
I got bored after I found about ten, but you
can keep going.
There are loads endless ways of writing a straight line.
, pick your favourite.
Probably one from that side and one from that side.
It's useful to have a vector equation of a straight
line, But, , yeah, we're used to seeing these.
These are all things we've we've seen before.
We're going to discuss the cross product a bit later
today, but determinants.
, yeah.
So lots of ways to write a straight line.
And that's where we ended yesterday.
So on that note we are going to do our
first question which is all about straight lines.
So first question if we have the line L passing
through the origin.
So we are back to having numbers.
we're passing through the origin and we have vector
equation x equals t times some d plus a.
Which of the following is true a has to equal
zero, a doesn't equal zero.
A is a scalar multiple of d d equal zero
d doesn't equal zero.
Have a chat with your friend.
Have a.
Think about this.
What are we thinking?
This.
Is.
And.
Okay.
Over half people have voted, so I'm going to give
you 20s more.
Whoops.
Oh.
Let's pretend that didn't happen.
Okay, let's see what we're voting.
So let's get to 100.
Let's have two more people vote.
It'd be nice to get 100.
Nice round number.
No.
No one asks for, , a vote.
Oh, there we go.
Well done.
The 100th voter.
, right.
Okay, so.
Lots of people saying a should be zero.
.
Or D should not be zero.
, okay.
Some people saying A is a scalar multiple of D,
some saying none of the above.
Oh keep.
Okay.
Let's see what some of the comments are.
What about a should equals error y intercept y intercept.
It is Friday I know it's a great feeling.
yeah I see where you're coming from.
And actually if we think about the , parametric form
of of a line.
So we've got something that looks this.
We're essentially saying we've got a you know, this is
a point on the line because if I stick in
T equals zero, this is a point on my line.
So I know zero is on my line.
So yeah, that makes sense.
, we're also saying d should an equal zero.
Does anyone want to say any comments about D.
Should an equal zero.
Yeah.
Zero zero equals.
To the origin.
Yeah.
Exactly.
If d was an equal to zero we'd.
If that's equal to zero we'd just have x equals
p which is definitely not a line.
That's just a point x is just a pointer.
So we can't this equation is essentially saying here's a
point to get onto your line.
Here's a direction of your line that you can move
across T steps.
But if you can't move along your line T steps,
then you've not got an equation of your line.
So you better have that d not equal to zero.
Okay.
What about A is a scalar multiple of d?
, if A equals zero then the common multiple of
zero.
.
Okay.
If A is zero then yes, they are technically scalar
multiples of each other.
a minus t equals zero goes to the origin.
Yes you zero and a is equal to zero.
Then this statement is true.
So B is not equal to zero is not always
true.
So we say that again.
B and a are zero.
Yeah.
And x equal to zero goes to the origin.
For the equal to zero is true.
okay.
But if both D and in this case I seem
to have changed my notation r zero, then you've essentially
got the equation x equals zero.
That's not a line.
That's a point.
We still want it to be the equation of a
line.
So x is.
Equal to zero.
That means it's a line because it doesn't matter what
he's just going to be.
so okay so safety equals zero and p equals
zero.
Then this whole equation is just x equals zero.
That's not the equation of a line because that's just
the equation of a point.
We're just what is that vector.
It's got zero sides and no direction.
It's two dimensional.
And d can be anything except an axis.
So so x is the kind of unknown bit.
So okay so let's think of it.
Let's deconstruct this equation of the line a bit.
This is essentially I've got my line and I've got
somewhere my origin over here in this particular case, my
origins on my line.
But more generally we've got a line in an origin.
Equations of this form have some vector d that go
along the equation of the line.
So giving us a direction to go along that line.
And then this point p is just some point on
our line.
So this is a kind of directional vector.
And p we're actually taking to be a positional vector.
So from the origin it's giving us a point to
go to on our line.
So then what this is saying is the point x.
The general point x on my line is I go
up p, I go from the origin to P, then
I go along d by some scalar multiple of it.
So I take ds t steps along d and then
I get to the point x.
, and that's the kind of addition.
Yeah.
I think the last.
Confusion is because X represents a vector, not an.
X coordinate.
Yeah.
So that's this is the vector, you know, x1 all
the way up to x n for example.
, it is a general point on our line that
we're trying to find.
It's not a fixed point.
So so D and P are fixed vectors.
We have the vector x is just the vector of
the point on the line we're trying to find.
Does that make sense to people a bit.
Yeah.
So if D is zero then we can't.
We don't have a direction for a line.
We don't know which way our line's pointing.
So we probably almost certainly definitely don't want D to
be zero.
Any questions or are we happy with that.
We're good.
Okay.
.
So what kind of conditions do we want on a
do we want?
So in our case, the origin is actually on the
line.
So we could take.
Does that mean a has to be zero.
No.
Any other opinions Y no.
Anyone?
You're right.
It doesn't have to be on the line.
Okay, so we know it could be zero.
We're not saying it's not zero, but actually all we're
saying is it's it's some it's some point on our
line.
It doesn't have to be the point zero just because
zero is on our line.
Does that mean that's the only point we can choose
when writing this equation?
We could choose any point P, we could choose.
You know, let's actually draw the line L through our
origin.
So we've got our vector D.
Along a line we could choose that point, but we
could also choose this point.
That's still going to be our starting point.
And we can walk along from from this point.
So it just it doesn't have to be zero, but
it does have to be a vector that to get
from the origin to I pass along d.
So it does have to be a scalar multiple of
d.
Are there any questions or does that make sense to
people?
Oh it's quiet Friday.
Okay.
Are we a bit happy?
Very happy.
Not happy or kind of middling?
Not happy.
Okay.
We're generally middling to good.
Okay.
I will take middling to good.
We have some very enthusiastic people, some middling people, and
no one's saying no, I think so.
, it is worth having a think about this.
, and I think one of the example videos in
the reading quiz will be on this.
So worth coming back to.
Okay, so that's the equation for line.
, let us move on to the equation of a
plane.
, we've seen the parametric form of a plane.
What's the parametric form for a plane.
So this is the parametric form for a line.
What's the parametric form for a plane?
There you go.
There's my unknown vector x.
Yeah.
There we.
Go.
So, .
Oops.
Let's write this.
Let's have one vector A, two vectors B and a
game.
We're going to have a pointer that takes us to
our plane, because our plane doesn't have to go through
the origin.
And even if it does, we can choose another point
to start with.
Essentially what we're saying here, and you'll have to excuse
my bad drawing, is here's my plane.
I want a point to get onto my plane from
the origin.
I'm starting at the origin.
Give me a point to go to.
And then I want two vectors, in this case A
and B, in order to be able to walk along
my plane so I can walk one way, I can
walk another, I can walk anywhere along my plane.
But I need just a point to start on my
plane.
This is the point where you plonk me down and
yeah, I've got somewhere to begin and then I can
walk anywhere I want to.
Okay, so it's the same principle as the line you
plonk me down somewhere and then I can walk along.
Except this time I can walk along in two directions.
So I get a plane.
Good.
, so this is the parametric form, , which we've
seen before.
, we also have the normal form.
So if we think about this equation of the plane,
all of those points A, B and P, or lie
in the plane, they're all points in the plane, P
is a point on the plane, and A is a
vector that lies in the plane, and B is a
vector that lies in the plane.
Because if not, I wouldn't be staying in the plane
when I walked along.
So everything there is in the plane, and that's generally
very useful.
If you're looking at the plane, it's useful to see
what is in the plane, except sometimes it's not.
Sometimes it's useful to see what's not in the plane
rather than what it is.
, particularly in three dimensions, if I'm in three dimensions
and I've got to find a plane, how many dimensions
do I have?
The kind of aren't in my plane?
How many ways off can I jump off my plane?
One.
Yeah, exactly.
There is one unique line that is perpendicular to my
plane where I could one direction I can go in.
That's definitely not in my plane.
So in my walking on the stage example, that's up.
If I jump, I'm not in my plane.
I've gone up and my feet left the floor.
, and sometimes it's useful to know what that third
direction is.
What is the direction that's not in the plane.
And then you can kind of take the plane to
be everything that's kind of not in that third direction,
that's perpendicular to that direction, which in some cases is
a really useful way of looking at it.
So this is the normal form named because we call
this perpendicular.
, what does anyone know what we call this?
Perpendicular.
Hopefully you all do the normal.
Yay!
So this is the normal vector.
Okay.
So we're going to take our general point x which
is some point in the plane that we want to
find.
, and we want actually to find a line in
the plane.
So we're going to take away a point in the
plane that we know is in the plane, and then
we want this to be perpendicular to our normal vector
n from yesterday.
Do we remember how to what operation did we have
that showed if two vectors of perpendicular dot products.
Yay.
Okay, so I can take the dot product for then.
And I want that to be zero.
Perfect.
Okay.
So there's the normal form of a plane.
So I have a vector normal to the plane.
And I have a point in the plane.
.
Good.
Okay, so let us try another question.
Thinking about planes.
, so there's an equation of a plane, the normal
equation of a plane.
And I am going to have two points on my
plane, A and B, two points on my plane.
Is it true that n a has to equal n
b?
So I will give you a moment to think about
this.
Have a chat.
And.
Then we will have a chat about it all together.
Okay, I'm going to give it over halfway, so I'm
going to give you 20s left.
Okay.
10s more.
Well, we seem to have stalled slightly in the voting,
so, , we seem to have a firm consensus that
this is true.
Yay!
Okay, so the vote about about 4/5 of us are
saying this is true.
Three quarters of us are saying this is true.
Why are we saying it's true?
, they are both on the plane.
NP equals, , XP equals BPL.
Yeah, I can't speak.
It's Friday.
X n equals p n, so x a equals n
p b.
That's true.
By the distributive property.
good.
Can we have fun as a set of vectors Friday.
Vectors are fun.
You're obviously not buying into the vector fun.
.
Good.
I think that is all good.
Oh, okay.
I'm just going to adjust this one comment, actually, because
this is a good a good thing to bring up.
Actually the dot product is zero with the normal for
both of them.
Okay.
That's not actually true.
, so let's let's think about it in in and
let's try and draw another picture.
I'm sorry.
You're doomed to watch me do lots of bad pictures.
, so in this case, we have some vector, some
plane with a normal, and then we have two points
a, b.
We're saying those points are in the plane.
We're not saying the vectors are in the plane.
In fact, they're not.
These would be the vectors from the origin.
If if I just say these are points in the
plane and we're talking about them as vectors, we're talking
about them as position vectors.
So as the vector from the origin to that point.
, so yes, these both lie in the plane, and
any vector that lies in the plane dotted with n
would be zero, but a and b as vectors.
The vector a does not lie in the plane.
The vector A goes from the origin to A that
is not in the plane.
The vector from A to B that's in the plane
that's lying on the plane, but the vector A from
the origin to the point A is not in the
plane.
So actually these aren't perpendicular.
Yeah.
The direction along the plane, not the point.
On the plane.
So again, it's.
Welcome to the fun world of vectors, where we use
the word vector to describe many, many different things.
, so the question said where A and B are
two points on the plane.
So when we're taking them as points on the plane,
we're taking them as position vectors.
So it's not A and B, it's not
a and B from the previous one.
Notation and maths is not consistent.
Basically there are only 26 Latin letters capitalised.
Still some Greeks still a bit of Arabic.
You still don't have enough letters.
, so they are different from the A and B?
We just had any other questions.
Okay.
So that's a good yeah a good point that the
dot product with the points A and B aren't
zero.
But we do have if you rearrange this we do
have x dot Start n equals p dot n.
So that must be true.
Okay.
So that , is planes.
, let us move on to talking about projections.
Which is another thing that's very important.
So let's start with just a projection on a line.
So there's my line L.
It's a vector equation of a line.
So I'm going to have some D that goes along
the line.
And let's have some p that's on my line.
And that's going to define parametrically the equation of my
line.
Okay I'm then going to have some vector u.
And at some point you I'm going to put the
tail of u on the line L because I can
do that.
U is some vector that I'm going to put the
tail on the line u.
Why not?
Okay.
And then I'm going to project you down to L.
You've done this a lot.
You've been projecting secretly ever since you started doing coordinate
geometry.
So, , when you, when you do things , you
know, we consider x, y as, , x times one
vector and y times those vectors, that is just projection.
We're taking a vector and we're projecting down to the
x coordinate and we're projecting down to the y coordinate.
So we're doing exactly the same thing you've been doing
ever since you started writing coordinates down.
We're just doing it for General Line.
, so again we want to project down.
We want to find this Vector, which I'm going to
call u1.
So U1 is lying on my line.
It's along the direction of my line and it forms
a little right angled triangle with you.
What's this dotted vector?
What's thinking about what we did yesterday?
How can I write this line in terms of U1
and U.
Yeah.
Pardon?
, I'm just thinking.
I don't think you're wrong, but I'm just thinking in
terms of addition and subtraction.
.
Yeah.
It's u minus u1.
Okay.
So that's what that vector is.
Okay.
And some people make all this U2 because it's the
second coordinate of U with respect to the normal of
this line.
.
Okay.
So we then want to project down.
What do we how does U1 relate to the vectors?
, on about the line L, what do what do
we know about U1 and the vectors DNP?
Yeah they're parallel and yeah.
Good.
They're multiple.
Good.
So this is some multiple of D because D
is the direction of my line.
This is pointing in the same direction.
So it's some scalar multiple.
It's a different size but it's got the same direction
okay.
So we know we hit this vector.
And this vector have to be perpendicular.
And we know this one is just a scalar
multiple of this.
So what's nice operation.
We know if we've got perpendicular lines dot product.
Brilliant.
So we can put this all together.
We know that U1 well actually we know You two
dotted with D has to be zero.
We know this is perpendicular to the line.
We can write this as u minus t times d.
Instead of writing u1, let's write in terms of d.
Equals zero.
And then if you do a load of rearranging the
book does this.
So I'm not going to go too much detail.
But if you rearrange this you can find that t
is a number that's equal to u d divided by
the size of d.
And that is how we define the projection.
So we're going to say the projection of u onto
the line L which is defined by we're going to.
Well yeah we can define it by L.
Sometimes people might write here D because D's defining the
direction of this line.
And actually if you think about this projection the position
of this line doesn't matter.
It's Parallel lines, so we more care about the direction.
Then we do the exact point it goes through.
, so some people might write this as the projection
onto the vector d of u.
But all of this is going to be is it's
going to be ug over d squared times d.
Okay.
So that is how we project.
And we can do this iteratively.
That's how to project onto one line.
If I then had another line I could take you
to and I could project onto another line.
So I could find the X coordinate project onto the
x axis, for example.
And then my U2 is going to be something lying
in the y and z coordinate, the y z plane,
and then I could project that vector into the y
coordinate.
And what I'm going to get left with is the
z coordinate.
So I can do this iteratively.
I can build it up, , all the way onto
projecting onto a plane for example.
.
So actually let's do an example together of projecting, ,
onto a plane.
I think.
Yeah.
Let's do this.
, so we have let's think about our plane.
We're going to give it a normal vector n, and
we're going to have two vectors u and v lying
in my plane.
All happy so far.
Good.
, we're then going to have some vector u.
And we're going to try and define it.
And I'm going to do this example with actual numbers.
So there we go.
So we're going to have the vector U which is
going to be 213.
And we're going to have the vector.
We're going to have our plane defined by this
equation.
Okay.
So that's the equation.
My plane it's not got a constant term.
So where actually what point has to lie on this
plane.
The origin.
Yeah.
Because you can take turns to be zero.
Good.
So we know that the origin is somewhere on this
plane.
There you go.
That's the origin.
Okay.
So let's project you down.
I'm going to call this plane Pi because that's you
normally call a plane capital P or capital Pi.
, so we'll go for pi.
There's some P's later.
, we have two options.
We could project onto the normal and take that away
to find you one.
That's the other thing we could do.
So in our line example, we could project onto the
normal line to find U2.
And then via subtraction we'd get U1.
And with a plane that can sometimes be more helpful
because there's only one normal, whereas there are two vectors
in my play.
So you're kind of huffing the work in some ways.
But this is where how you write the plane becomes
important, because if you don't have the normal, then that's
work to do beforehand.
So we're not going to just project onto the normal
and take away.
We're going to just project onto these two vectors, ,
straight away.
So we are going to have the projection onto my
plane pie.
We will go to any questions okay.
, of the vector you and we're going to do
this, but .
Let's call these two what should I call these two
vectors?
Anyone have any preference?
Do you one and d two.
Okay, I realise I've got you twice.
I'm going to make this 1AW.
.
Okay.
So we're going to first project onto D1 and then
project onto D2.
So we need you dot D1 over the size of
d1 squared times D1.
And then we're going to do the same thing with
two.
Does that make sense to anyone.
Does anyone have any thoughts questions.
Have I lost you all or is it just a
Friday?
Yes.
We are the vectors of the plane.
Yeah.
And then you as a random vector that's not in
the plane.
Yeah.
So what we're trying to do is we're trying to
project this down and find this vector, which is the
projection of U onto our plane.
Okay.
Does that make sense?
But what we're doing.
Is it goes through zero.
Yeah.
In this case it has to because there's no kind
of additional point.
If I I'd set T and S to be zero,
then I'm going to get out of here.
X equals the origin, so I know the origin is
somewhere on my plane.
Okay.
Any other questions yet?
Just to be precise, shouldn't all be in the beginning
of you.
Pardon?
Cos you start from the origin.
So from the future should it be.
Yeah.
Well, yes.
Again this is the kind of what is a vector
question here.
Are we saying you as a point that starts from
the origin or we just turning up saying u is
the vector 213.
If we're just saying u is the vector that goes
along to across one and up three, then we don't
have to start from the origin.
If we're saying u is the vector corresponding to a
point, then yes, they would have to be from the
origin.
But at this point we're not we're not saying.
It's.
I'm treating it very much as just a line at
this point as opposed to you.
The point I appreciate this is very confusing.
We use the word vector to mean a position vector.
We use it to mean a line.
We use it to mean something geometric.
.
You kind of get used to seeing these things in
context, which isn't the overly helpful answer I appreciate.
, but there we go.
Okay, so what is u dotted with D1?
What are we going to have?
Here's my vector u, here's D1.
What happens if I dot them?
I get four plus minus one plus minus six.
Good.
And what am I going to have on the bottom.
What is D1 dotted with itself.
Three.
Yeah it's four plus one.
Oh no it's not three.
It's four plus one plus four.
So it's nine.
We're looking at the norm squared here.
So four plus one plus four.
Everyone happy.
They're good.
And then we're going to times this by the vector
D1.
Okay.
What about you dot d1.
What are we going to have here.
Yeah.
Good.
Two plus one plus three.
Let's write this all down.
I should probably write this in order.
There we go.
And what is D2 dotted with D2?
Yeah.
.
Good.
So we can do all this addition.
And we're going to have minus three over nine times
our vector.
, but in fact, let's just make that a third.
There we go.
Plus six over three which is I'm actually going to
keep it over three just because it's common denominator.
Okay.
So if we all add that up, what are we
going to get?
Something with a factor of three in the front.
what.
Six minus two is four.
What's the next one going to be?
Seven.
Don't ever do maths live on a stage.
, six minus minus two.
Eight.
The square of the, , Divisor advisor.
.
Ah.
Yes.
You.
Right.
That should be.
Yeah.
Good.
Okay, good.
So that is the.
I've got a different.
Yeah.
Okay.
, are we all happy there, or have I made
a mistake?
I'm fully willing to believe I've made a mistake in
the calculation.
Or are we generally happy with what's gone on there?
Yes.
Why did you add the two projections?
Okay.
So we're projecting onto this.
We're projecting onto the line you, , so we've got
one line here which we're projecting onto and one line
here, or, you know, one line here.
Projecting onto.
All we want to do, though, is project onto the
plane.
So actually we're not trying to project just onto you
just onto D1 or just onto D2.
We just we need those two projections together to get
a point in the plane.
So is that a point that we've got.
Is that.
Yeah.
So this is this is a point , and this
is going to be well, it's a it's the vector
from our starting position wherever our tail of you met
the point, the plane.
, it is that vector there that is going to
be perpendicular, , to the normal from you.
Yeah.
If you look at it, if you're staring above, looking
down, that's the vector.
It's the shadow of the vector.
You.
If you're hovering.
Above.
Directly above the plane.
Good.
Any other questions?
No no, no.
Okay.
, so projection is helpful because this perpendicular distance is
the shortest distance from this point to this point.
So one of the big applications we use of projections
is finding the shortest distance.
but let us move on because we still have
to do the cross-product.
, so let us discuss the cross-product.
Okay.
Last topic.
, so everything I've said so far today and yesterday
works for any vector or you can generalise it to
any size vector.
, you need to be slightly careful about some details,
but generally the basic theory works for how big your
vector is.
The cross-product only works in our three.
This is only in R3, so that's something to be
very careful.
There's also a version in seven dimensions actually.
But let's not mention that.
, but otherwise there is absolutely no generalisation.
It holds in three and seven and nowhere else.
Okay, so all three vectors, , that is the definition
of the cross-product you cannot see.
Ta da!
There we go.
That is how you calculate the cross product.
, please make sure you can calculate the cross product.
It is one of those types of.
So we've now got two types of vector multiplication.
The cross product is important and it is surprisingly important.
It turns up in surprisingly wide areas of maths.
So it's useful to have some practice to just doing
some cross products and making sure you can do it
reasonably confidently.
, , so yeah, always a good thing to be
able to do.
However, that is the definition that is really not very
helpful at telling you anything about anything about what is
going on.
So let us think about what's going on a bit
more geometrically.
, so the cross product, if I've got two vectors
u and v.
The cross product finds me the vector perpendicular to both
of them, Hence why works in three dimensions.
So u and v are going to span some kind
of plane.
The cross product is going to find me some multiple
of the normal.
It all actually follows a right hand rule, so you
can work out which way the cross product should point.
You stick your forefinger in your middle finger as u
and v, and your thumb points in the direction of
the cross product.
Okay, so that's telling us the direction.
What else do we need for vector though?
Magnitude.
Good.
So the magnitude is actually the.
Size.
Of the parallelogram spanned by u and v.
So if you got u as one edge and v
is the other edge, that parallelogram in the middle, the
area of this equals the size of the cross product.
So let us think about what this looks .
What's a big screen?
This big screen.
Okay, so here's my two vectors u and v.
And if I as I change v then that's not
what I meant to do.
, as I change v and make it closer to
you, that area of my parallelogram gets smaller and so
too does my cross-product.
Whereas if I make my parallelogram really big, my my
cross product gets really big.
And actually I can then use my right hand rule.
I can flip it if I keep going around.
Okay.
And this works not just in the x coordinate.
If I move this up, I tilt it and I'm
going to tilt my perpendicular line.
There we go.
And then I can shift things around again.
Okay.
Okay.
So we've.
does that make sense?
Does anyone have any questions on on that aspect of
the cross product.
Okay.
So then let's think about a kind of more natural
definition of the cross product.
, how could we find the area of this parallelogram
just going back to kind of school maths.
How do we work out the area of a parallelogram?
A5 yeah.
, yeah.
Half based, , based on site.
Or actually, let's try thinking about it as two triangles.
How do you work out the area of a general
triangle?
What if I call this angle theta?
Yeah.
Good.
But I've got two of these so we'll get rid
of the half.
Yeah.
So this area I could just say is well it's
the size of one length.
That's the norm of u times the norm of V.
And then the triangle is half that times sine.
So but we've got double that.
So are we.
Are you the time to sign.
Okay.
And then some people therefore define the cross product as
this thing.
, times the unit vector n where n is the
unit normal.
Two u and v.
Okay.
So that is a useful thing to see.
okay.
So we now have.
So what happens when u and v are perpendicular.
Does anything fun happen there.
Yeah this equals one.
So so r when when we're perpendicular we get the
biggest possible value size of u times v.
So if I can kind of.
, let's make these a bit smaller so we can
see, , if I oh, let's let's reset it.
And then it'd be easy to see in the flat.
Okay.
So commonly that is perpendicular.
This is as big as it gets.
If I move it this way it gets used you
times V is getting smaller.
That's the biggest thing it can be if I move
it that way.
It's also getting smaller.
So it's maximal when they're at a right angle.
What about when they're not at a right angle.
What about when they're parallel zero.
Yeah.
Good.
So let's think about well the area of my parallelogram.
Is.
Doesn't exist.
So yes indeed it is.
Zero.
, so this actually gives us quite a useful way
of checking when things are parallel perpendicular.
We have the dot product is zero if they're
perpendicular and the cross product of zero if they are
parallel.
So that is a useful thing to be able to
check.
Okay.
Let us do one last question then on .
On the planes and perpendicular lines.
So is it true which the following is true.
You've got a plane defined in normal form, , with
n equals x minus p.
And we've got another plane defined , in parametric form.
How do these two link together.
So we've got a plane in normal form and the
same plane in parametric form.
So A and B are two vectors in the plane
n is a vector perpendicular to the plane, p is
a position vector for a point that lies on the
plane, but the vector p itself does not lie in
the plane, which is.
The following is true.
Does a times b equal n?
I'm going to give you a couple of minutes.
Feel free to have a chat.
I'm going to give you one minute because we're nearly
at the end.
So quick vote.
Go with your gut.
Feel free to guess.
Okay I'm going to give you 30 more seconds.
I know I'm having you, but honestly, feel free to
guess.
Can I give you ten more seconds?
But we have a clear winner.
So this is good.
Okay.
So voting is in and we have a times B
equals n okay.
That's what the vast majority of you are saying.
Some of you are saying it depends on the vectors.
So, , are you good?
I the person I've convinced Vector Fridays are fun
fighters.
Good.
, N is perpendicular to A and B.
That is very true.
Yes, n is perpendicular to a and b, , a
and b lie in the plane n is perpendicular to
the plane.
So those are perpendicular.
That is very true.
, the normal is perpendicular to both direction vectors.
The normal is.
Yeah.
That is all very true reasoning.
I very much agree with all of you.
, sadly, you are all wrong.
The vast majority of you are wrong.
.
Let's think about this.
So you are true.
They are all perpendicular.
The direction is right.
So A times B does lie in the direction of
n, but ns any normal vector n is any vector
that is perpendicular to the plane.
So it could be a different size.
So what is true is they are parallel that a
times b a cross b is some multiple of the
normal vector I have randomly given you in this equation,
but that doesn't mean they are the same.
They could be a different size, same direction diff wrong
size.
We all seem very convinced that a cross N cross
A doesn't necessarily equal B, and vice versa.
, there is a case where that is true.
What extra condition would we need on A and B
where that is true?
For A and.
B, yeah.
If A and B were perpendicular to each other and
all the sizes worked out, then that could be true.
, so if you had, for example, three vectors that
were all unit vectors and all perpendicular to each other,
then that is true.
So it is true for the vector I, j and
k for example.
So you might have seen I j equals k and
all the other ways around that works.
, so yes.
Good.
Okay.
We are out of time.
, homework was released.
I mentioned that Andreas will be with you next week.
Have a nice weekend.
Thank you for coming.
