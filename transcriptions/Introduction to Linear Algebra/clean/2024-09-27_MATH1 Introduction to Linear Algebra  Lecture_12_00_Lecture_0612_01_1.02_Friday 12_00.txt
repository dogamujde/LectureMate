Right.
Okay.
, so welcome back.
, this is the QR code for my lecture polls.
, that I'm using.
I'm going to take that down in a second.
, we don't have an attendance poll today on Fridays.
Good.
Before I go into what we're doing today.
, I just want to go back to something that
yesterday and make you aware I made a mistake.
, so I asked you, , where are we?
, we were on the PC.
On the PC?
There we go.
, I ask you what the middle one there is.
The second row is and said that is associativity.
, I have to say, I've only looked at the
last two items there.
, the first equation sign, of course, isn't associativity, but
rather you're taking the A out of the whole thing
so that Commutativity.
That part.
It'll sort of both together.
Yeah.
, sorry.
I've only sort of glanced at it and thought, oh,
yeah.
Associativity.
, , what's wrong there anyhow?
Right.
Okay.
Once we have that, where are we for today?
So here's one thing.
I'm going to start with something that sort of fits
in yesterday.
, but we've got to go back to that, make
it slightly lighter.
And, , it is a relatively important application of matrix
vector multiplication that we've done yesterday.
, so I remind you that we're talking about functions.
, so functions is something that you've seen as a
function from R to R from mapping numbers into numbers.
, so you just you just basically function as a
rule.
You have an input, you have a rule, and then
you have an output.
So I could have for example x squared.
, so here's my rule square the input , and
I write this down as f of x, you know.
, but you can obviously do something that to
anything.
We can do something that to for vectors, ,
where we have also rules how to transform a vector
into somebody else and something else we tend to call
this transformations here.
, to some extent it's interchanged with the name with
functions.
So that is really it.
But think about a transformation as a function applied to
a vector.
So something that I can do to transform a vector.
For example I could use the matrix as that yesterday
and do a matrix vector product.
So I could say if I've got the vector X1X2
here, I could transform it into the vector that I'm
getting by multiplying this vector with the matrix from the
left.
You know, , so I can work this out.
We've done that.
, and we can write this again as a transformation.
So I can say in this case, t of x
T for transformation rather than f of functions is defined
by of a vector, x is defined by axe.
, and quite often we use a notation just to
indicate that this T with a subscript a, and we
call this the transformation that is induced by a matrix.
And this is actually very, very important application of matrices.
You can think about matrices actually as transformations to some
extent.
There's a certain equivalence there.
We'll come to that quite a bit later.
So I said here we call this or typically call
this to of x.
But remember the Ta is really just a name a
label that we put to that.
Yeah we could call it anything else we .
And it's the transformation induced by a.
So that's an important concept that keeps coming up throughout
this course.
, and the reason I'm doing this here is because
it will come up once we do matrix matrix multiplication,
, and matrix inverses.
, it's quite often , , if there's duality or
thinking about what is the matrix, what are the properties
of the matrix.
And on the other hand, very closely related to that
is thinking about what is the transformation induced by the
matrix and what are the properties of this transformation.
So let's start , I've got here, so I'll start
with a poll and saying I've got a matrix given
up there, which is relatively simple, almost the identity.
And what is the transformation geometrically, what happens to
a vector in R2 space.
, if I multiply that by that matrix there.
, and let me just go quickly onto my.
So you've got my ruler pole there.
, remember that was it.
And I just need to go, , reset this from
yesterday and display it.
So do you see that?
You do see that.
And somebody's answering.
Right.
Okay.
All right.
The results.
All right.
See if we can get a few more.
, about 15 seconds left.
Right.
Okay.
Time's up.
And so vast majority says that this reflection on the
y axis.
And indeed it is.
, and just to, , for completeness, , I think
I'm just going to go through this.
Right.
, go through this in detail.
So if I have, , let's work this out.
What is minus one 001 times X1X2.
Right.
Okay.
You don't see anything?
, there we go.
Right.
Okay.
, so I can work out what happens here.
, and this is if you do the matrix vector
multiplication, this is a minus x one and x two.
, so in other words, , if I've got a
sort of vector here, , I'm going to leave the
x2 component intact.
And the x1 component, I'm going to flip around the
y axis.
, so it is a reflection on the y axis.
Yeah.
So in a simple example that you can just
do that by sort of just working out what it
is and then thinking what is this dramatically.
, once it gets more complicated and higher dimensions, obviously
more difficult.
But we were quite a few of the things we're
doing here.
We deriving in the course will help you then to
classify pretty much any matrix into the sort of transformation
geometrically, that it induces.
Okay.
So , that was just, I said just hanging on
from yesterday a little bit.
Now get into, , the matrix matrix multiplication.
So, , assuming we've now got two matrices A is
M times n, b is n times k.
.
And I say a little bit something about the dimensions.
, and so we know how to do , how
to do matrix vector multiplication.
Yeah.
, so we're just applying this Here.
We use pretty much the same trick as we've done
yesterday.
This matrix B that we now want to multiply.
What were we saying a times b.
So we divide this up into its columns b1 b2
b k.
And now we're saying that the product a times b
is simply that we multiply the matrix A here with
every vector with every sort of column of the matrix
B or the other way round.
We take every column of the matrix B in turn,
multiply that with a, and then put them all together
in a new matrix.
So that is the matrix matrix product.
Again general principle we know how to do something something
more extended.
We'll try to we try to use what we know
in the new definition.
So what's the size of what we've got here.
, so this new matrix A times B, , in
terms of, , rows and column dimensions, what is the
size?
, I'm just going to do that by asking somebody
if you've got an idea rather than a poll here.
Right.
M times K yes, that is correct.
, I'm not going to go through sort of working
that out.
I'm just going to give you the common rule or
rule of thumb or memory aid for that.
So if you've got an M times n matrix
a here, , that you're multiplying with an n times
k matrix B here.
, then in order for that to work the multiplication,
the middle dimensions here have to match.
And then it basically cancels them out and you're left
with the with the two n dimension.
So that's quite useful.
And another reason why this rows before columns is, is
quite sensible, right?
I'll show you that for everybody else.
Okay.
, now, this is to some extent arbitrary.
So you might ask, , this is relatively complicated.
I mean, apart from saying we know matrix vector multiplication,
we try to use it again, matrix addition we've just
done component wise.
Yeah.
So why why do we not just the matrix multiplication
component wise?
, and the answer is , we could do ,
I mean, of course, nothing nothing prevents us from doing
that.
And we could see whether that is useful.
, it just turns out that this way of doing
matrix matrix multiplication is very useful.
And again, we will see, , during the time of
this course of what it is indeed useful for.
, it's not obvious.
, it's been sort of suggested that this, that this
is what we should do relatively recently, now and then
people have worked that out But it raises sort of
I think an interesting question is, our mathematicians, what
do we do?
Do we discover things or do we invent things?
Yeah.
So it's all the mathematics out there just for us
to to uncover it or are we actively inventing stuff?
And I think this very much shows we are actively
inventing stuff that might be useful.
It's not obvious that you have to do matrix matrix
multiplication that way.
It's just somebody suggested it turns out to be useful.
, okay.
So once we've got that, I've got a number of
poles here.
I won't do all of them.
I'll have a selection.
I think I won't do that one there.
I would quite to do this one here.
So we've seen these matrices yesterday.
, and ask whether I can add them together.
, turns out none of them can, but we can
multiply quite a few of them together.
So I'd to know what you think.
Which of these a, b, d down to e?
Which of these possibilities which of the matrices canyon will
deploy it, which you can't because it quite need to
check a couple of things.
There is a bit more complicated.
I'm going to give you two minutes for this poll.
So and I do need five choices now.
So just reset this in case it hadn't been.
And then I'll give you a five choices poll now
on the laptop that should appear there in a second
hold.
Wait wait wait wait wait I did say five.
What I did say two minutes.
I will give you two minutes.
I just have to reset the timer once it's time
down.
.
And another minute.
Yeah.
So almost up.
Right.
Eh.
And quite a few.
None of them.
, the other only half a little bit.
So a is correct.
Indeed.
, so all of them, I, , I tend to
think that, , in order to check that, I sort
of take a column of the second matrix, say a,
that's got three elements, and see if I can sort
of the matrix vector multiplication, turn its on its
side and put it over the top of the other
matrix.
So BA that works.
D has three dimensions that I can put that on
top of C.
C has just one dimension.
The columns.
But I can put that on top of D.
And then C has one and A has three dimensional.
I can put that on top of C.
So A does indeed work, but sort of get into
the habit of checking whether these things work.
Right.
Okay.
, so yeah.
Yeah.
No, I think I've deleted the other one that I
didn't have.
, so this is an interesting one, actually.
, so assuming that you've got, you've got matrices and
all these, the dimensions match that all these products work
and you've got a b equal to c b.
Well, if this was numbers you'd be sort of cancelling
the b out as long as it's not equal to
zero.
, we have not equal to zero.
Does this work here?
Am I right?
For choices and it's life.
Ha ha ha ha!
Now, this looks very, very interesting.
Pretty much equally divided between all of those options.
So can I, .
This is actually complicated because there isn't a direct answer.
It depends a little bit on how you understand the
question.
So who who says somebody who says this is true.
Can you give me can somebody give me an argument
why this is true?
I've seen you first.
Multiply both sides by b minus one.
You will end up paying me then.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That is exactly the answer that I was looking for.
So if you multiply both sides by b minus one
by b inverse, , you can derive that.
And indeed that's true.
, let me just, , quickly show you that.
So, .
All right.
Got too many pens here.
, so if I start with something if I
start with a B equals to CB.
Yeah.
, there we go.
this a little bit bigger, right?
And, , so I can multiply this if I half
b minus one here, I can multiply both from the
left on both sides.
So I can do a b b minus one equals
to c b b minus one.
and okay I mean I need to think about
the order there.
But that is associative.
And I have here b b minus one.
That just gives us an identity.
So this is a identity equals to see identity.
And then we see multiplying anything with the identity keeps
the identity.
So this is a equals to c.
right.
Yeah that's that's okay.
But it only works if you have B inverse.
Yeah.
You need to have B inverse for that.
We only have given b is not equal to zero.
And that's not the same thing.
Indeed for a lot of these things if you if
you have stuff that, something that works in real
numbers under the condition that B equals is not equal
to zero.
Typically it works for matrices under the condition that that
matrix is invertible rather than not equal to zero.
That is the condition that you need.
But it doesn't always work.
And I was wondering whether anybody of those that are
thought and they're certain have a counterexample.
, you've got your.
Sorry.
It's coming true.
There isn't always an inverse to matrix.
No.
Chips and.
Right.
Okay.
It doesn't work.
But I mean, this argument doesn't work all the time.
But the question is, it might just be true anyhow
or without the argument.
, so you have an example matrix.
With the rows 1101.
As.
A1101.
Yeah.
The 0001.
And if I do that out I'll get 0101.
Yep okay.
Instead if I use see if I use a say
2111.
.
Which matrix?
The first.
122111.
And keep be the same.
I still get 010 on.
The wrong pen here.
So this is zero.
, this is one.
This is zero.
This one seems to work.
Yeah.
Good, good, good.
Excellent, excellent.
, I.
All right.
I didn't see that one immediately.
, although.
So the zero is here.
Yeah.
No, no, you're right, you're right, you're right.
.
The zero one in the second column will be kind
of extracts the second column.
Okay.
And C.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So it's just so it's a bit, it's a bit
, .
Right.
Okay.
Let's take it.
Let's take this example.
I think the point I was going to make, you
can actually see from your example just as well.
So the first column there of zeros here just maps
everything to zero.
Doesn't really matter what you're doing.
, and as you said, the second column there, the
zero one that you have there will just extract the
second column from the first matrix.
Yeah.
So it doesn't matter what you put in the first
column there.
You could have put anything there.
Yeah.
So, , what you effectively doing by multiplying with another
matrix?
If it's not invertible, you're losing information that is not
able to reconstruct again.
So that's why something that doesn't always work.
Okay.
Good, good.
, it's a bit I don't think I want
to do that.
I think I'll actually want to go on a little
bit.
I think I want to do this one here.
So matrix matrix multiplication we said.
And that's why I've done it.
We can think of a matrix or matrix vector multiplication
as being a transformation.
There's some sort of equivalence.
Now what is a matrix?
Matrix multiplication.
That is equivalent to some sense.
Or that means in some sense that we're chaining to
transformations.
So if you've got the matrix A here we say
to is the transformation that is induced by it.
And we've got another matrix B.
And we say TB is the transformation induced by that.
So what transformation will be induced by a b.
And I've just given those transformations there in a slightly
obscure notation.
You have two choices.
And I just need to get a two choices.
This is just there's just two choices.
You're not true or false.
Two choices are good eight.
We got a bit longer to think about.
This reset this one reset to choices?
.
Right.
Okay.
It doesn't give me a timer.
I have to do this manually.
.
Right?
10s.
Okay.
, just a few more coming in.
Let's have a look at the results.
So.
Okay, this is interesting.
The majority thinks B.
Actually, a is correct.
, there's not much I can give you to do
that.
It's just.
You are right.
There's something confusing there.
At some point, the thing that looks the other way
round than what you think.
But it's not this.
So just to just to recapture what is going on
here.
So I mean, to some extent it's just obscure notation.
You know, the question is I've got this to train
with TB applied to X, what do we actually mean
by that.
And TR trained by TB.
What we actually mean by that is simply that we
say this is to of t a of TB of
x.
Yeah.
so that's, that's simply what it is to of
TB of x.
Yeah.
And then if I have a vector x.
So that means if I evaluate this I first of
all apply the matrix and multiply by the matrix B
from the left.
And then I multiply with a matrix A from the
left.
So this gives me a b x.
Yeah.
So that's the transformation induced by that.
now the thing where it does become confusing is
that you think so what does this what does this
do.
So I've got to make a vector x here.
, so if I do want to evaluate this to
of TB of x, I'm actually evaluating from the middle
outside.
Yeah.
So I'm not doing first hire and then TB.
I'm doing first TB and then to.
So I first of all applying TB to this here.
so this will give me the matrix B x
here.
and I think what we've had here, this was
living in our case space, , this is living in
MB space.
And then I'm doing the TR transformation here.
, that now will give me a b x.
, this is living in r n space.
, and I can do everything at the same time
here and this transformation here.
I'm going to call to change with TB.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, but.
, how does TB map X from.
K to M.
So b is an n times k matrix.
Yeah.
So I have to multiply the k vector.
And it would give me an n vector.
And I've done right.
I've got my M's and the ends the wrong way
round.
Yeah.
All right okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You're right.
Good.
Okay.
So the confusing thing was something that.
Is this operation.
If I see if I see a B times X
or to apply to TB of x, which operation do
I do first?
Well, , that's the thing that you have to think
about, , how this works.
, okay.
So there is sort of matrix matrix multiplication.
, the other big topic that we're doing today is
inverses.
, and give you a little bit of a motivation.
I'll just put this on both sides that, .
You all see this?
, I am there.
Yeah, right.
Okay.
So, , if I had an equation that, a
x equals to B for an A, which isn't equal
to zero.
, in numbers, what would you do?
You know, divide divide by a.
Yeah.
You just divide by a.
So I would just say I can divide through by
a and then I get x equals to b over
a.
Yeah.
Now we've seen that a linear system of equations
something that.
We've seen yesterday that we can write this in this
form axe equals to b which formally looks the same
as we've got there.
, so how do we do proceed there.
Now, , if we divide by a.
Times the inverse.
Yeah.
So very important.
You never divide by a Via matrix.
Yeah.
Just never.
Even if you think while dividing by a matrix is
the same thing as having an inverse.
And we do have inverses, just don't.
, and the reason is simple.
.
So if I write, if I were to write something
, , in this case this is the other way
round B divided by a.
Yeah.
And I say, oh, well, this is the same by
multiplying by an inverse.
Well, what do I mean.
Is this b minus one times a or is this
a times b minus one.
Well , those in general are not the same thing.
Matrix.
Matrix multiplication doesn't commute, so those are not the same
thing.
I have to decide what I want, what I want
this to mean.
And that's why this this one would be ambiguous.
, I wouldn't know what it means.
So don't don't do that here.
, Always decide on one of those two.
, if you need to do something , ,
dividing by a matrix.
, okay.
So, , back to where we were.
Yeah.
, so we can't divide three by a, we have
to use inverses instead.
, so, , just back to the drawing board, but,
, the answer, the right answer already came from there.
, so in real numbers, rather than dividing through by
a, we can of course multiply by the inverse by
the reciprocal there.
, and we can do the same thing in linear
systems.
So , what does this mean.
, I'll do it this way round.
Same thing.
We've got a linear system.
We realised we can write this as a matrix vector
equation there.
, we say we can multiply by a minus one.
So, , let's just have a look at this matrix
here.
You know, And try to work out what this is.
So what is B times a?
And I probably before I do this here in just
three I'll give you a couple of seconds.
Really.
Well I'm not doing anything where you can do this
in your head or write this down and just check.
Right.
Okay.
Anybody has got an answer.
It's the identity.
Matrix.
It is the identity matrix, indeed.
So let's just check a few things.
So first element here I'd have to use that column
and that row and take the take the scalar product.
So three times five is 15 two times two is
four.
That is 19 together divided by 19 is one.
next one here minus two times five plus plus
two times five is zero.
And the others work the same.
Yeah.
So I've got zero one.
So indeed this is the identity matrix.
so so this is the inverse.
I'll come to that in a, I come to that
in a second.
, strictly speaking actually at the moment, our definition of
inverse, I think I have that in a couple of
slides.
But the definition of inverse that we had so far,
, required us to do A times B as well
and check that one, that that also gives the identity.
Just to make you aware, I'm not doing that at
the moment.
I'll have a justification for that later.
, but if I have this matrix B now, what
I can do is if I want to solve axe
equals to B, I can multiply everything from the left
by b, , and then realise that the left hand
side of what I've written there, , b times axe
I can, I can use associativity, I can move the
brackets, that is ba times x b a.
I've just worked out as the identity.
So that's the identity matrix.
It is x.
So I've got a formula there.
Yeah I've got a formula.
I know that a x is equal to b.
so I've got a formula that x equals b
times the right hand side of my system now.
So I can now go and just work this out
here.
, the matrix vector multiplication and multiplication by this scalar
there.
And that gives me x equals one one.
, so what I've just done is I solve this
system of equations without using Gaussian elimination.
That bit surprise you.
, thing, of course, is that I've made up this
matrix B there, , which are sort of.
Well, you've read in in Nicholson.
I haven't told you how to find that, but of
course you do find it through Gaussian elimination.
So, , it's, , you haven't really won anything.
It's just an interesting observation.
If you have an inverse.
, you don't have to do Gaussian elimination.
You can just solve the system, , by multiplying it.
, okay, so I think I've got a definition here.
Yeah, we have this.
So a matrix is an inverse.
If we have able to , both BA and a,
b are equal to the identity matrix, , then it's
called an invertible matrix.
I denote this by minus one.
, and just to remind you, you might be used
that for numbers.
If I have a minus one, that's just another way
of writing one over a in this case don't divide
by matrices.
So , do not write that.
, yes.
And indeed what we have there is the inverse, ,
this matrix P that we had earlier was the inverse.
, okay.
So just a couple of things on inverses that I
had before, I sort of go back to doing something,
, for a few matrices.
We just know the inverse.
For example, if you have a diagonal matrix, , we
can just invert every element on the diagonal and that
gives us the inverse.
Yeah.
This strictly only works for diagonal matrices.
If you've got any off diagonal elements.
, that doesn't work anymore.
Yeah.
, also for 2 or 3 matrices, Is there an
explicit formula.
And you will see if I have if you have
a look at my my b there, my A there,
you will see that this is one over 19.
And swapping the elements about a little bit is exactly
what comes out of this formula here.
I have to say, I don't remember that formula.
I know that it exists forever.
Knitted.
I look it up.
There are corresponding formulae for higher dimensions, but they get
pretty unwieldy.
, so tend to not to be used.
I should point out this thing in the denominator.
There is.
You will later see this is called the determinant of
the matrix a , it's a very useful thing.
And what it is, what it does determine is indeed
whether a matrix is invertible or not.
Yeah.
, and the determinant, unlike this formula, the determinant is
very useful in higher dimensions.
And also having it as a criteria of whether a
matrix is invertible or not.
, right.
Okay.
So what can go wrong?
, so I'm claiming this matrix T is not invertible.
, and I do this in the following manner.
They say let's calculate those two matrix vector products there.
And again while I'll write down here I'll do
this.
Do this together with you while I write down the
stuff.
, here, I encourage you to try to work this
out.
, yourself.
Sorry.
Okay.
So, .
Anybody got an answer?
714.
Yes, that's what I got.
, and then for the next one, let's do this
together.
, minus two and three times one, three.
So this is a minus two plus three.
Three.
, that's a seven.
And this is a minus four plus 18.
This is also a 14.
Yep.
So.
All right.
Okay.
In view of that.
, what then is the solution to this system of
equations?
Hmm.
Two answers.
Actually, not just two answers.
You'll know from what you've done last week that if
you've got two answers, you've got infinite, infinitely many.
So any combination of those two will also be an
answer.
But we have several answers.
Now, if this here where an invertible matrix, if we
did have an A minus one, we could just write
down the solution to the system as a minus one
times b.
So that would just give us a single answer.
But we have two answers.
So by contradiction this cannot be an invertible matrix that
we have out there.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Let me just check.
I've got ten minutes or so.
Where am I and what did I want to do.
, and what was important to do.
No, I think we're pretty much we're good on time.
We're very good on time, I think so, of course.
Yeah.
In order to check, I should say that in order
to check whether it's invertible or not, you can have
a look at this determinant.
, a times D is six and b times C
is also six.
So determinant is zero.
This is not an invertible matrix.
Yeah.
.
Right I might as well give you that one here
a Po.
So if I've got an invertible matrix and a scalar
which is not equal to zero, so it's k is
the scalar times k, is that invertible.
True or false.
Okay.
Ten.
Oh, I haven't given you.
I haven't shown you the poll.
What is that?
Is counting down.
.
It's a bit late.
I think you've seen the countdown on your app or,
.
So we've got.
It's Count it down.
Results are the vast majority think it is true.
And in this case, that is true.
There's no trick question here involved.
, I can just say one over k times a
minus one.
, that is the inverse.
You can check it by multiplying things together and see
whether that works.
, so I'm not I do this in a second.
I'll do this.
, so I've got a couple of properties.
An inverse is unique if it exists, the identity itself.
Invert.
These two are quite useful as calculations rule.
If I have a product a times P and invert
that, I have to change the order of the matrices.
, same as we've had for transposition.
, and again, same as for transposition.
If I take the inverse and invert that again, I'll
get my original matrix back.
Just to summarise that.
Now Nicholson then has this monster theorem there, the inverse
theorem 2.4.5.
, and if you skip that because it just looks
too long.
I encourage you to really do look at it because
this is very, very useful.
Now, , so it'll tell us, I want to say
two things about it.
Tell us a few things that are equivalent.
, so what does it mean that a matrix is
invertible?
It means, for example, that a homogeneous system has only
a unique solution, which is the trivial solution.
, it also tells us I'll go to for first,
, that any system of equations with that matrix has
at least one solution, no matter what the right hand
side is.
So, , it tells us under three that we can
carry the matrix to the identity matrix for elementary row
operations.
, we've seen that that because the rank in that
case, if it's the identity of the row operations that
has rank N, so it's a full rank matrix.
, and it says the existing matrix such as AC
is I n that a times C is the identity.
Yeah.
So the thing that I want to, as I say,
these things are very useful to, to have in mind
and indeed will later get another inverse theorem.
I want to point out the way that Nicholson proves
this is quite, is quite, , interesting because it says
everything of this is equivalent.
And he proves that by saying from one follows, two
from two follows, three from 3 or 4 from 4
or 5, and then from five follows one to complete
the circle.
And if you proved all of that, you can pretty
much go from anything to anything else.
So it's an interesting and useful proof technique to keep
that in mind.
I encourage you to look through all of them.
.
Right.
Okay.
And, , I just want to point out the step
from 5 to 1.
So we've got a matrix that AC that we've got
a matrix C and we know A times C is
the the the the identity matrix.
Why do we still need to prove that then A
is invertible.
Is that not the same thing.
What remains to be proven there.
Somewhere in the middle there is.
You have to prove that C times.
Yeah.
Invert from what we've had so far about identity would
have to move proof the other direction as well.
Now this tells us it's part of the equivalent.
So this theorem tells us actually we don't have to
do the other direction.
Yeah.
It comes for free.
So that's that's interesting.
Okay.
So the last thing I want to do, what I
skipped over here is, , how do we get inverses?
, and I think this is from Nicholson.
, so it's a matrix inversion algorithm.
Rather than explaining that, then slide to you.
, I will just, , quickly show you on the
visualiser.
And I'm not going to do the full example, ,
on the reading quest on Monday.
, if you look through, I do work on a
video through the full example, but if I want to
find an inverse of a matrix, say, , the matrix
that I had earlier, where where did I have that?
.
, right.
Well, my.
Matrices, if I.
Want them.
There we go.
, so we have this matrix A that we had,
it was three minus two, two five.
, there we go.
So if I want to have the inverse of that,
, what I do is I do Gaussian elimination and
I do Gaussian elimination with two right hand side.
So I'm just using one zero.
But I also use zero one.
, other words on the right hand side I just
put the identity matrix in the correct dimension.
, and then I go through Gaussian elimination and I
go through a glass formation trying to get this to
reduce excellent form.
And I've just known that if I've got reduced, if
this is an invertible matrix, my reduced reduced row echelon
form is actually the identity will look that.
And this one will just end up being a minus
one here.
Yeah.
, and that might look pure magic to you
at the moment.
, I will go into quite a bit detail why
that works next week.
, if you think about.
Right.
Okay.
, no, I just make this thing.
If you think about what we're doing here.
So a times B, we want a half as equal
to the identity.
Yeah.
, now we defined A times B as this being
a times the first column of a times a times
this the or the other columns of B by doing
that matrix in that way.
Yeah.
, and if we, , if this would be equal
to the identity.
The identity.
We can also take apart into its columns.
Yeah.
So this is exactly what we've done there.
So what we're doing here, we really need to just
solve n linear systems of equations to find the identity.
And that is exactly, , what this thing here is
doing.
So as I say on the on the reading quiz
on Monday, I work, I think, through three by three
examples in detail and we will get next week much
more sort of insight of how these things work and
why they work.
Right.
Okay.
That's it for today.
Oh, I should say somebody came in and said, can
you please leave through that door?
, that because in order for some fire regulations or
so, , that has stairs, if you don't fancy the
stairs for some reason to go up there.
