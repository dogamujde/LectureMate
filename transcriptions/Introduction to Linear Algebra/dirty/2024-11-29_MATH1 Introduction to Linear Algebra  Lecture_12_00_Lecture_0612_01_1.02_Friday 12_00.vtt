<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 0>So the way this is going to work, we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.750

<v Speaker 0>ask questions about other things as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, but yeah, I'll be so I'll be I'm Erica,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 0>I'll be leading this first hour and this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Is I'm Kasia.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,39]}

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll be leading the second hour.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 2>The first and second hour is going to be very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>similar depending, but it depends.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 2>If people have particular questions to ask, then it will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,79]}

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>change a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100]}

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 0>So that's some good to everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,95,100,80,80]}

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Straight if you want to ask.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 0>No I think we'll do first example first and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 0>we can then we can take questions because then we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 0>kind of in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 0>Sure okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just going to find it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 0>Aha.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 0>There we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>That's better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 0>So we have our first question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 0>And this is just a slightly modified one from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,95,65]}

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.370
<v Speaker 0>of the quizzes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100]}

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 0>So we have an n by n matrix and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 0>have a non-zero vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100]}

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 0>And then we have that this equation axe equals b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 0>has a unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 0>And we are asked how many solutions does the equation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 0>axe equals zero have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 0>So if you were to be confronted with this kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 0>of question, which I guess you all have, and it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100]}

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 0>been in one of the quizzes, well, how would you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 0>start it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a very big lecture theatre to be interactive, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 2>don't be scared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 0>well, one thing that we can do right is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 0>we can just do doo doo doo doo.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.930
<v Speaker 0>We can start by letting V be the unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Factor and r n such that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,74,83,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.330
<v Speaker 0>A v is equal to v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 0>And so this one we know that it's unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.080
<v Speaker 0>And since we're asked to solve this equation look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 0>the number of solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.210
<v Speaker 0>Well we can just introduce a vector u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 0>So let you be a solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.770
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.590
<v Speaker 0>A u equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100,100]}

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 0>So now we need to somehow leverage this information that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 0>we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 0>And what we know about are matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 0>The kind of linear operations that they induce.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.859
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.090
<v Speaker 0>Is that they well they're linear right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.270
<v Speaker 0>So does anyone have any kind of hunch on this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.630
<v Speaker 0>question what the answer should be, how many solutions this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.890
<v Speaker 0>equation should have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.650
<v Speaker 0>Do we have okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 0>Can we have a show of hands for no solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 0>Unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 0>That's a fair number of people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 0>Infinite amounts of solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay, we have a few people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 0>So the consensus seems to be that it has one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 0>unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, with the algebra, sort of what we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 0>do right is that we can use the linearity and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 0>we can write a now of well, we already wrote

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 0>a V and a you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,78,100,98,89]}

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 0>What's left?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 0>You can do a u plus b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,78,100,100,92,100,65]}

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 0>And you use the linearity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,97,100,100]}

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 0>So this is a u plus AV.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 0>And now we can use what we know right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 0>A b is equal to b a is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,100,100,79,99,100,100,100]}

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 0>So we get zero plus b equals to b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 0>But what does this all mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 0>Well, it means that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.800
<v Speaker 0>You plus V is a solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.950
<v Speaker 0>To.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[24]}

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.050
<v Speaker 0>Axe equals b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100]}

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.920
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 0>And so wit this information in hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,46,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.290
<v Speaker 0>Is it now going to be unique as it's somehow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,85,100]}

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.400
<v Speaker 0>clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.610
<v Speaker 0>Because so what we what would happen right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.650
<v Speaker 0>If we had an infinite amount of solutions U to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100]}

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 0>our equation here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.010
<v Speaker 0>Well what would happen is that then we have shown

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 0>that we would have an infinite amount of solutions To

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 0>our equation axe equals b here, but we assume that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 0>this one was unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 0>So we already know that this one, this vector, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 0>simply has to be v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90]}

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 0>Because that was the only solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 0>But if this is equal to v so what do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 0>we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 0>We have u plus v c equal to v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 0>Fairly simple equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 0>Oh no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay so we'll scroll down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 0>Um fairly simple equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 0>You must be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 0>Now this is a very abstract and algebraic approach to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 0>So so what would you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.470
<v Speaker 0>If you looked at this and you're just like, how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 0>how do I even do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 0>Where do I even start?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 0>Well, one thing that you can always do when we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 0>have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.810
<v Speaker 0>If I scroll back up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,82,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Speaker 2>You've got a question on the second screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[27,27,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah, I could.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 0>That is wow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 0>So when we have these general efficient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.040
<v Speaker 0>Um r m and r n as well here, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 0>we could always do is we could just let m

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.200
<v Speaker 0>equals n equals two to make our problem simpler.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 0>So I'll just make a little line here to denote

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 0>that this is now a new one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 0>So what would we have then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 0>Well we would have that our linear transformation goes from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.060
<v Speaker 0>R2 to R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 0>And the benefit of this is that I can draw

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 0>R2 reasonably well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 0>I can maybe draw R3, But not that well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 0>So what we can do then is if we slide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,89,98]}

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.390
<v Speaker 0>this all the way up, we can have a look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.440
<v Speaker 0>graphically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.500
<v Speaker 0>At what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 0>So I'll draw two copies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.960
<v Speaker 0>Of our two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54,57]}

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.500
<v Speaker 0>And now I'm going to input some stuff here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.560
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to put my B here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to assume that it looks something like that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.400
<v Speaker 0>maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.560
<v Speaker 0>And then I'll put in my V the vector that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.820
<v Speaker 0>maps to B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77]}

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.960
<v Speaker 0>And we'll say it looks something like that maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.100
<v Speaker 0>So we have our map here between them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.730
<v Speaker 0>To and it takes the vector v to the vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.030
<v Speaker 0>b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.750
<v Speaker 0>And now the second thing that I'm going to do,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.470
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to mark the origin in red here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.870
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to take draw r u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,58,87]}

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.300
<v Speaker 0>Which is getting mapped to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.410
<v Speaker 0>So here this is one corresponding to to this equation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,100,100,100,100,87,83,100,100]}

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.070
<v Speaker 0>right here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:19.510
<v Speaker 0>And so what we can observe here now is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 0>I have drawn a U that is not the zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.230
<v Speaker 0>vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 0>This is this is not the zero vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.930
<v Speaker 0>And so we can see kind of like what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.950
<v Speaker 0>Because we always know I'll go back a bit because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.770
<v Speaker 0>when we look at the solution right x equals zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 0>is always a solution to this thing no matter what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 0>we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 0>And so if the solution is unique, it has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 0>be the zero solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100]}

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 0>So but because I don't know exactly how to proceed,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 0>I am going to say that it's a non-zero vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,63,100,100,100,100,95,100,79,100]}

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to see what kind of trouble

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 0>I find myself in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 0>And from that, see if I can kind of gain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 0>some intuition about why it should have a unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 0>And so we have a map and it's linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 0>And what does this mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.620
<v Speaker 0>Well you had some properties right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 0>That you can scale things and that you can add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 0>But one thing that is going to do is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 0>it's simply going to take lines to lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 0>So you goes to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 0>And in fact the entire line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 0>Right here is also going to be mapped to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 0>origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.160
<v Speaker 0>Because we're just having we're saying that a U is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49,100]}

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.150
<v Speaker 0>equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:53.630
<v Speaker 0>And so that means that a of two is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.580
<v Speaker 0>to t, a u is equal to t times zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.900
<v Speaker 0>is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.470
<v Speaker 0>So this entire line is going to end up getting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.460
<v Speaker 0>mapped to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.700
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.740
<v Speaker 0>So what does this mean for the solutions to axe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.800
<v Speaker 0>equals b i.e. what vectors are going to be mapped

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.340
<v Speaker 0>to b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.440
<v Speaker 0>Well I'll draw another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.060
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.680
<v Speaker 0>I'll draw this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:35.810
<v Speaker 0>And I'll call this one here w and it's just,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.010
<v Speaker 0>it's just u scaled.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 0>Maybe I should actually call it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 0>I'll call it properly, like a scaling of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 0>So I'll call it like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 0>You say okay and let's see how much space do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 0>I have?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 0>I have a bit of space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 0>So then what can we observe?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 0>We can observe that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 0>No, that's the one that I wanted to name you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 0>I'll, I'll, I'll do it in orange.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 0>So we have this vector here, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 0>I'll call it w.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 0>And we have w is equal to s u plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 0>v okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 0>So then a of w is equal to a of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 0>s u plus v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.130
<v Speaker 0>And here again we can use linearity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.050
<v Speaker 0>We have a Su plus AV.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,55]}

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.930
<v Speaker 0>And what do we know?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.150
<v Speaker 0>We know that AV is equal to B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.980
<v Speaker 0>We know that A of s u is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,38,100,100,100]}

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.610
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.670
<v Speaker 0>So we have zero plus b equal to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,57]}

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.670
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.160
<v Speaker 0>So we have that this vector here the blue one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 0>also gets mapped to the vector b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.160
<v Speaker 0>And so it's no it's not unique anymore right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.540
<v Speaker 0>Because being a solution right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.900
<v Speaker 0>That the solution is unique means that only one vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.000
<v Speaker 0>can be mapped onto the vector p.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.530
<v Speaker 0>But it's not only that we have one additional one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.490
<v Speaker 0>here because there's nothing unique about this like Su, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.920
<v Speaker 0>can scale it differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.950
<v Speaker 0>So I can do that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 0>I can do that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 0>Well, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.270
<v Speaker 0>It's just imagine that all of these are like the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:44.960
<v Speaker 0>vector v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.480
<v Speaker 0>My drawing is not that good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 0>And so what's going to happen is that this entire

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 0>line here is going to get mapped to the vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 0>b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 0>So because we have infinite solutions here to the axe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 0>equal to zero, this line here we also get this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 0>line with infinite solutions to um axe equals b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 0>So that hopefully a nice illustration about like how you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 0>could gain some intuition about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 0>I have been talking for quite a long time now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.600
<v Speaker 0>So are there any questions on this example so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.230
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,72,71]}

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Was the unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,86,86,81]}

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Why have we shown that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,82,84,100]}

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.300
<v Speaker 0>Oh right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,96]}

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.810
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:51.250
<v Speaker 0>So so the question was like we assumed that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,99]}

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.150
<v Speaker 0>had a unique solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.640
<v Speaker 0>Now we provided an infinite amount of solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.140
<v Speaker 0>What was the point of all this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.670
<v Speaker 0>And very good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:03.220
<v Speaker 0>So the point of all of this was to have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.150
<v Speaker 0>you be a non-zero vector, and then seeing that everything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.860
<v Speaker 0>breaks down right when we let it be the, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.280
<v Speaker 0>non-zero vector, which would give us more than just a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.310
<v Speaker 0>trivial solution, that is x equals zero here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.090
<v Speaker 0>Then everything kind of like breaks down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.580
<v Speaker 0>And so kind of what we done, we done kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,83,100,100]}

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.190
<v Speaker 0>of like a proof by contradiction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.360
<v Speaker 0>So we suppose that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:38.550
<v Speaker 0>So what we've done is that we assume that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.360
<v Speaker 0>are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.020
<v Speaker 0>Is it you not equal to zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:49.410
<v Speaker 0>Also under n solves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.820
<v Speaker 0>A you equal zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,73,69,100]}

00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:01.710
<v Speaker 0>And we have shown that this implies that there exists

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.350
<v Speaker 0>infinite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.199
<v Speaker 0>Solutions two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.890
<v Speaker 0>To this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.180
<v Speaker 0>And so our conclusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Is that you will equal to zero is the only

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 0>Axe equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 0>Does that answer the question?

<v Speaker 0>I already forgot who it was that raised their hand.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.970
<v Speaker 0>to most.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,100]}

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.970
<v Speaker 0>If I can find it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that you're taking it, you'll see these methods of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.290
<v Speaker 2>proof like proof by contradiction properly in next semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Any questions about subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,97]}

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.030
<v Speaker 2>So basically spanning is that all these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,77,100,93]}

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.730
<v Speaker 0>Subspaces and spanning okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100]}

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.690
<v Speaker 0>Uh so we have one question here that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.320
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't have span but we can do one on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.250
<v Speaker 0>that as well later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.030
<v Speaker 0>Um so oh yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.170
<v Speaker 0>We can just move this here immediately and have this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.850
<v Speaker 0>one available for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.350
<v Speaker 0>So we have the following question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.050
<v Speaker 0>Are any of the following subspaces of R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.230
<v Speaker 0>So what do we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.070
<v Speaker 0>We have some kind of some kind of plane here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 0>Some kind of weird parabola thing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 0>and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 0>Well, I think we'll get to them, uh, in turn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,98]}

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 0>So we'll just start with the, the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100]}

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we'll do a poll like we did right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 0>with the previous one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 0>So everyone who believes that this is a subspace of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.820
<v Speaker 0>R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 0>No one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 0>Everybody believes that this is not a subspace of R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 0>So the consensus is very clearly that it's not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 0>And does anyone want to explain why it's not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 0>Why does it not believe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,66,100,100]}

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 0>Oh there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't go through the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 0>So we have a fairly quick solution here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 0>The origin does not belong to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:24.080
<v Speaker 0>So Q is not a sub space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,76]}

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.560
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.510
<v Speaker 0>Now we move on to this second set here, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.440
<v Speaker 0>I'll do the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 0>So who believes that this is a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:46.700
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41]}

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:47.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.010
<v Speaker 0>Who believes that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.270
<v Speaker 0>It's not a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:52.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.600
<v Speaker 0>We have a lot of hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.150
<v Speaker 0>So the consensus is clearly that this is not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.020
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.570
<v Speaker 0>And can I have a reason for why it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:00.380
<v Speaker 0>a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 0>Even the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32,100]}

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.760
<v Speaker 0>So it's not linear okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77]}

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.950
<v Speaker 0>So I would like that to to make that a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.640
<v Speaker 0>bit more precise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:13.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.590
<v Speaker 0>Because we have three axioms that it needs to satisfy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 0>Going through the origin we have the right the linearity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100]}

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 0>So you mean the additivity, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 0>So what we can do right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 0>To see this is I'm just going to draw the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 0>um let's see what how does that is that explain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,36,99,100,87,100,73]}

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.820
<v Speaker 0>So let this be the z axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 0>I'll let this be the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 0>And then you can imagine kind of the y axis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 0>coming out of the page.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 0>So what do we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.490
<v Speaker 0>We have a parabola.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.220
<v Speaker 0>And right so this is RV.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 0>So do you have any concrete suggestions for which two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 0>two vectors to add up so that they're no longer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 0>in the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 0>So the sum is no longer in the set?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,79,100,100,100,100,57,31]}

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Speaker 0>200.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.830
<v Speaker 0>001.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.400
<v Speaker 0>And the other one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay, 200.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.080
<v Speaker 0>So we have our example points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:58.230
<v Speaker 0>And now, uh, where would these be on the diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.130
<v Speaker 0>So let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.540
<v Speaker 0>So it would be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.910
<v Speaker 0>This would be here right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:13.140
<v Speaker 0>And this one would be here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.170
<v Speaker 0>So these ones are the vectors already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.990
<v Speaker 0>Don't lie on the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.100
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no, it's completely fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,74,100,100,100]}

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, I would rather like this is the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.580
<v Speaker 0>I hope that this is a safe space to, like,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.660
<v Speaker 0>make mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.020
<v Speaker 0>Because making mistakes is how we learn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.400
<v Speaker 0>Like, when I took this courses, a literal ton of

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.020
<v Speaker 0>mistakes that I did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 0>And that's how we learn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100]}

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh, we still make them now all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Even on material like this, it's still easy to make

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 0>Even, like, we literally like, we we spent time before

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 0>we are not confident that we will get the calculations

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 0>correct on the spot.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 0>So going so I need two new vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Just take any two symmetric vectors in the parabola and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 4>add them up and the sum is in the z

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,99]}

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.100
<v Speaker 4>axis okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76]}

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean take one in this side and another in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.920
<v Speaker 4>the other side, like the reflection of it.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:35.860
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying like take something like 101 and visualise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.040
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.180
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's write down the vectors first and then we'll draw

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 2>them.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:40.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:41.950
<v Speaker 0>So we'll just uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,63,97,39]}

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.860
<v Speaker 4>On one side and the reflection on the other side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.820
<v Speaker 0>So if we choose this point for example like and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.520
<v Speaker 0>I just choose it because it's uh, I like my

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.830
<v Speaker 0>And you'll have to excuse me that my parabola is

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.660
<v Speaker 0>slightly deformed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.540
<v Speaker 0>So it's, you'll just have to imagine that this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.000
<v Speaker 0>like one one and the coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then you said for the second one, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.890
<v Speaker 0>just mirror it in the z axis and we go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.350
<v Speaker 0>Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.570
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.670
<v Speaker 0>And then when we add them up, I'll draw the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.590
<v Speaker 0>arrows as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:20.670
<v Speaker 1>It might be a.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:21.510
<v Speaker 0>Bit crowded.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.990
<v Speaker 1>But.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.240
<v Speaker 0>When we add them up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.050
<v Speaker 0>How about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.610
<v Speaker 0>We've fallen outside our set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39,47,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:40.200
<v Speaker 0>And so now we immediately jump to the adding stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, axiom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.220
<v Speaker 0>But just as an observation, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.140
<v Speaker 0>We could also have used the fact that scalings need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.650
<v Speaker 0>to be, um, contain like still on the line because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:52.980
<v Speaker 0>example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.300
<v Speaker 0>For example, if I take a point here, right, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.350
<v Speaker 0>whole line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:06.030
<v Speaker 0>Should be on and a subspace if it is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.780
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.160
<v Speaker 0>But clearly it's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.640
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.670
<v Speaker 0>All right, so what about now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.770
<v Speaker 0>The last one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:25.120
<v Speaker 0>So now we have this, um, set w, uh, where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 0>y squared is equal to z squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.110
<v Speaker 0>So we'll do the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, can we have a show of hands for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.210
<v Speaker 0>people who believe that this is a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Speaker 1>One two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.600
<v Speaker 0>And now can we have a show of hands for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.690
<v Speaker 0>the people who believe that this is not a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.740
<v Speaker 0>All right, so here we have a bit more disagreement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.410
<v Speaker 0>And so I think for this one we'll do the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.310
<v Speaker 0>same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.610
<v Speaker 0>And I'll I'll draw it out in a similar fashion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.770
<v Speaker 0>Uh, except that I'm going to let, I'll keep this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 0>as a z axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,56,100,94]}

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 0>And now I'll let this be the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 0>And you can imagine the x axis going out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 0>the screen towards you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 0>And so what is this set going to look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,43,97,97,100,100]}

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 0>Well we can if we write our equation wow z

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 0>squared is equal to y squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 0>So an obvious solution to this run rate would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,40,33,100,100]}

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 0>said equals y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87]}

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 0>As there are another solution to this equation I heard

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,72,47,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 0>z equals minus y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 0>And are there any more solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 0>So no no more solutions to this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 0>So we have equivalence between these two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.050
<v Speaker 0>And so what does it look like?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.970
<v Speaker 0>Well, this right here is a line, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.860
<v Speaker 0>It's this line in fact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 0>And this one here is also a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.580
<v Speaker 0>It's this line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.650
<v Speaker 0>So this is our set W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.000
<v Speaker 0>And with it drawn like this I think I'll, I'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.800
<v Speaker 0>do the polling one more time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.590
<v Speaker 0>So who believes that this is a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:40.490
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.460
<v Speaker 0>Who believes that this is not a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.130
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.960
<v Speaker 0>So some people who, um, some people have had a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.590
<v Speaker 0>change of heart.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.620
<v Speaker 0>And I believe that this is not a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.560
<v Speaker 0>So why would this not be a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not closed because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.640
<v Speaker 5>011 and means or one way is what we call

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,89,100,100,92,91,63,58,49]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[19]}

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.270
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying that essentially we have a similar situation

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.040
<v Speaker 0>Like if I pick something here and I pick another

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.210
<v Speaker 0>vector here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.620
<v Speaker 0>And I add them, I fall outside the set.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.370
<v Speaker 0>So the thing that I'm going to encourage you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.280
<v Speaker 0>do in general, which linear algebra, and I hope that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 0>has been a clear theme so far, is to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 0>drawings where you can write.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95]}

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 0>And we've seen that even when you're given very like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 0>general spaces like R2 and R2, then we can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.930
<v Speaker 0>our little toy example with setting them both to two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 0>just to see how things behave.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.040
<v Speaker 0>One thing that I wanted to observe about this one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:11.220
<v Speaker 0>before we move on is that oh, I forgot to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.540
<v Speaker 0>put the that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.440
<v Speaker 0>It's the third one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.330
<v Speaker 0>Is that this one will satisfy two of the axioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:21.930
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 0>And we do have that zero is in the space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.430
<v Speaker 0>And we also have that if v is a vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100]}

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:38.850
<v Speaker 0>in W then this implies that TV is in w

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:46.170
<v Speaker 0>um for all t in R, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.570
<v Speaker 0>Because the only thing that can happen essentially is like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.090
<v Speaker 0>when I chose my vector v, it is on one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 0>of the two lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.360
<v Speaker 0>And then when I scale it while I stay on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.930
<v Speaker 0>the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.290
<v Speaker 0>But as you pointed out, it still isn't closed under

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.950
<v Speaker 0>addition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.620
<v Speaker 0>And so it's not a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.000
<v Speaker 0>Uh, are there any questions on on this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.650
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.840
<v Speaker 0>Uh, then I think we can move on to a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 0>span question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93]}

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a good question for that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,91,100,100,100]}

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I've got one here as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You did?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,93]}

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.000
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah, I yeah, if you have one good there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.330
<v Speaker 0>then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Um, is it that one based on the previous one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,77,75,99,100,100,77,98,100,89]}

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.570
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:44.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, I might do the one with the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.380
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:45.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.280
<v Speaker 0>So here I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81]}

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Am, I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100]}

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Well, in that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.780
<v Speaker 0>Yes, but I want to take, take this opportunity to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.200
<v Speaker 0>do the other one that I wrote down, but I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.040
<v Speaker 0>didn't write it down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.260
<v Speaker 0>So we'll have a fun time with writing down the

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 0>question as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we'll move this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 0>And so here we're going to have two subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 0>We're going to have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 0>And V or no u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,81]}

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.620
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a little u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100]}

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:41.170
<v Speaker 0>Where q is in R3 and we have v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.970
<v Speaker 0>Where v is some arbitrary vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:07.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so which of the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.690
<v Speaker 0>Are true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.730
<v Speaker 0>You as a subset or subspace of V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.220
<v Speaker 0>V is a subspace of U.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.900
<v Speaker 0>He was not equal to V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.820
<v Speaker 0>He was equal to V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,97,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and it all fits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,92,100,100,50]}

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.790
<v Speaker 0>How about that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:12.379
<v Speaker 0>So I guess maybe we'll start with number four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 0>So are these going to be equal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 0>And we'll do the same I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:27.169
<v Speaker 0>Uh, just a show of hands for people who believe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 0>that they will be equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 0>No one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,94]}

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.139
<v Speaker 0>Who believes that they will not be equal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 0>Significantly more hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:48.379
<v Speaker 0>So why should they not be equal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 0>Do we have any reasoning for as to why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:00.880
<v Speaker 4>And they don't have to be prosecuted separately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 4>For example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.140
<v Speaker 5>Or one day or one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[10,94,24,7,79]}

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:05.950
<v Speaker 4>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.100
<v Speaker 4>One would be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,16,15]}

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.990
<v Speaker 0>Uh, one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100]}

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.570
<v Speaker 0>So your example is, uh, is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.540
<v Speaker 4>That you would be like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,64,58,67,67]}

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.520
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we will be a different one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Uh, and then something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,73,70,100,100]}

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 0>I'll do a simple 101, one then.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.530
<v Speaker 4>We'll spend all of our time, but one will understand.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:46.840
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.230
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.950
<v Speaker 0>So the claim that we have is that, um, we

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.380

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 0>Or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Well, maybe we'll do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 0>We don't necessarily.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 0>Hmm.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, the vibe is there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 0>Not necessarily.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 0>Equal to V, and this is the counter example that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,64,100]}

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 0>we were given.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 0>So then we would have span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.230
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I'm, I am very much sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,92,90,90,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 0>There should be spans here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 0>Because that was the whole point of this question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 0>That we're going to be dealing with spans.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 0>So just imagine that you was the span of these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 0>things V is a span of these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,36,20,30,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, so right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 0>So then you would be span of 110.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 0>101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.800
<v Speaker 0>And T101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.580
<v Speaker 0>And v would be equal to span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Speaker 1>110101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.770
<v Speaker 0>And 011.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.020
<v Speaker 0>And then it was pointed out that this should be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.330
<v Speaker 0>equal to R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 0>And so what did you say about the C2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,42,39]}

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.950
<v Speaker 0>So it will be it will be a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.590
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying that one of these vectors is going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.740
<v Speaker 0>to be redundant right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.190
<v Speaker 0>So for example like you have defined this third vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.400
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 0>So that it's simply a scalar of this one so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.220
<v Speaker 0>we can eliminate it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.280
<v Speaker 0>and we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 0>Thus this is equal to the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.190
<v Speaker 0>110101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.570
<v Speaker 0>And so we have the span of two vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.980
<v Speaker 0>So we have a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:13.780
<v Speaker 0>And then for v we have these three vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.540
<v Speaker 0>And so what was your reasoning for choosing the third

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.020
<v Speaker 0>vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.210
<v Speaker 0>What did you want for for this vector right here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:30.460
<v Speaker 4>In this case we know that the dimension of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,64,58,100,100,89,100,98,75,57]}

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 0>So so basically what they said is that, um, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 0>this vector here is linearly independent of these two, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 0>it's going to span all of our three, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,58,100]}

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 0>Because then we have three linearly independent vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.580
<v Speaker 0>So they're going to form a basis of R3, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.360
<v Speaker 0>means that every single vector in R3 can be written

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.840
<v Speaker 0>as a linear combination of them, which means that every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.780
<v Speaker 0>single vector in R3 is included in the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,81]}

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.810
<v Speaker 0>And so we conclude that it's equal to R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.260
<v Speaker 0>And clearly those two things are not equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:13.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.800
<v Speaker 0>So now another question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.590
<v Speaker 0>Uh, moving on to the other thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.780
<v Speaker 0>Do we necessarily have that these are different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.950
<v Speaker 0>So we'll do a polling again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.590
<v Speaker 0>So will these necessarily be different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.750
<v Speaker 0>Show of hands for those who believe so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.200
<v Speaker 0>Now on okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100]}

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.320
<v Speaker 0>Show of hands for people who believe that they can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 0>be equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:43.770
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.180
<v Speaker 0>That's a decisive majority.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100]}

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.930
<v Speaker 0>So what is your intuition?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.290
<v Speaker 0>Why and what situation could these end up being equal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.020
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.480
<v Speaker 4>If the vector u is equal to the vector v

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 4>on the inside, it means that the spans are made

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.980
<v Speaker 4>of the same vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.460
<v Speaker 4>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40]}

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.850
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.270
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying if we have u is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.220
<v Speaker 0>v then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:21.860
<v Speaker 0>We're going to have the span 110101V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.670
<v Speaker 0>And v is equal to span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:34.130
<v Speaker 0>110101V again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.080
<v Speaker 0>And so yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:39.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 0>Because then we even have that our lists are identical,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 0>They are completely identical.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100]}

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:52.750
<v Speaker 0>And so they would have to be um, and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 0>clearly the, the span has to be equal as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.590
<v Speaker 0>So could I have a different counter example where u

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,86,100,99]}

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 0>is not equal to v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 0>Use the multiple of v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 0>So so in that case we would have TV here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.580
<v Speaker 0>And so then the question is how can we conclude

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 0>that these are equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 0>Well clearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>T.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.220
<v Speaker 0>V is equal to t times v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:35.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.230
<v Speaker 0>So we know that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.800
<v Speaker 0>Um let's see what I want to have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.180
<v Speaker 0>I wanted to be in that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.600
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.340
<v Speaker 0>So then we have that TV is in the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:53.610
<v Speaker 0>Of V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:01.920
<v Speaker 0>And oh but this is interesting okay okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.000
<v Speaker 0>Can I take any T here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.230
<v Speaker 4>Let me just talk to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,98,91]}

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.030
<v Speaker 0>As long as it's not zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.330
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.660
<v Speaker 0>What what goes wrong if it's zero zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61,98]}

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.650
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:26.280
<v Speaker 0>So you're saying that if we had, um, v equals

<v Speaker 1>Whoops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:35.220
<v Speaker 0>Then we would have u is equal to span.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:59.690

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.760

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.590
<v Speaker 0>I can't remember if I said the same thing twice

<v Speaker 0>now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the thing that I wanted to to note

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:58.590
<v Speaker 0>right here, um, is that they are going to be

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.430

<v Speaker 0>Unless what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.600
<v Speaker 3>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35]}

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say they can be, uh, you

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,29,45,34,33]}

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.760
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Every person in both sets of linearly independent, but all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99]}

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,91]}

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.200
<v Speaker 0>So so here we had a very good, um, good

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.470
<v Speaker 0>input.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.590
<v Speaker 0>And I think we'll just hold that and get to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:43.790
<v Speaker 0>it after this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.980
<v Speaker 0>So, so now I want to look at these two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.090
<v Speaker 0>sets specifically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.910
<v Speaker 0>So I have uh, you in this case is the

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.390

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.550
<v Speaker 0>And we eliminated that one because it was redundant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.240
<v Speaker 0>And v is equal to the span of 110101 and

00:44:59.240 --> 00:44:59.600
<v Speaker 0>v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:05.270
<v Speaker 0>And so could it happen that these are equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 0>If v is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.190
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.560
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.560
<v Speaker 0>Equal if and only if v is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.490
<v Speaker 0>But then I, I heard a very, very interesting thing.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.760
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:32.150
<v Speaker 0>Which is um, that if we let V be different

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:33.890

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:04.540
<v Speaker 0>Linearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,89]}

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.280
<v Speaker 0>No, there was no point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.960
<v Speaker 0>There was there was no point to this.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, so in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, it was pointed out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:23.020
<v Speaker 0>So if let's see it, remember the names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,61,100,100,77,100,100,77]}

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.030
<v Speaker 0>So this was you, this was V, um, that if

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:33.960
<v Speaker 0>this is the case, then span V is equal to

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:42.630

<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 0>There is more.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 2>We can say in the previous case, if we go

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>back to what we did before.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Because what did we assume that we assumed u is

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 2>equal to v.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>This is how we should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I mean for here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:18.270
<v Speaker 0>So we assume that, uh, u was t times v.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 2>But did we assume that, uh, u and V will

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 2>be, uh, independent of the previous two vectors in the

<v Speaker 2>span?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.170
<v Speaker 0>That is a good question that we do that.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe we did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Did we?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Just select.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:39.650
<v Speaker 2>It.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Should this be an F?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,96]}

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.180
<v Speaker 4>1 or 2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,97]}

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:46.490
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I'm getting at.

<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:50.690
<v Speaker 0>So if I want to do my if and only

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:51.260
<v Speaker 0>if.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:55.430
<v Speaker 0>I have to do.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.270
<v Speaker 1>This.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:03.290
<v Speaker 0>Span A110 and.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.350
<v Speaker 0>101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.350
<v Speaker 0>That's the one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100]}

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.160
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully it's a ball.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,97,57]}

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.350
<v Speaker 0>Move it a bit like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.340

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:19.790
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.330
<v Speaker 0>So, so in order to have the if and only

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:28.130
<v Speaker 0>if we need V to be in the span, because

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 0>then again, what is it that happens?

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:36.190

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.450

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 0>So we're nearing the end of this revision lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.580
<v Speaker 0>So are there any final questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 2>You entirely welcome to stay for the second half is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Speaker 2>the second hour as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 4>All of the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.850
<v Speaker 6>Parts were like necessarily always true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,22,40,88,100,100]}

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:05.980
<v Speaker 0>That are right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.010
<v Speaker 0>So that that is a nice little wrap up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.020
<v Speaker 0>Um so what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100]}

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:11.380
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 0>What can we conclude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we said that like this one does not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 0>necessarily hold this one does not necessarily hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:28.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, and now For these ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:35.460
<v Speaker 0>What we have seen, right, is that one of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.300
<v Speaker 0>has to hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:39.750
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:46.080
<v Speaker 0>Because all of our examples were they were made to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.250
<v Speaker 0>be different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.470
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.770
<v Speaker 0>Was when we had that one of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.000
<v Speaker 2>That.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.360
<v Speaker 0>Oh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.090
<v Speaker 0>We'll do this one then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,95,100,100,100]}

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:06.990
<v Speaker 0>So all of the ones where they were different was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:12.420
<v Speaker 0>when one of them was the entire space, and one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.200
<v Speaker 0>of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:24.420
<v Speaker 0>Was the plane given by 110101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 0>And so you could convince yourself maybe after all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:38.330
<v Speaker 0>these examples, that these are in fact the only two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:41.450
<v Speaker 0>possibilities for them not to be equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 0>And so what can we conclude?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 0>Well, we can conclude that you as a subset of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 0>sub V or these a subspace of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,93,100,82,99,100,100,87]}

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.910
<v Speaker 0>So we don't we don't have any of the one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 0>items.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 0>But we can like if we put a little more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,46]}

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 0>here then we can do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 2>At least one of those have to hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,38,96]}

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 0>But I think that we will end it there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 0>So thank you very much for attending and good luck,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 0>everyone on this synoptic quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,48,93]}

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you get a lengthy like a five minute break?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,93,58,39,47,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Then?
