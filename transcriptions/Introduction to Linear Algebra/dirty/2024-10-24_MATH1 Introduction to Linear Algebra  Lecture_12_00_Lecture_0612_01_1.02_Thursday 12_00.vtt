00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 0>So does somebody want to add to anything there any

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.840

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.370

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.860

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,40,83,58,85]}

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.990
<v Unknown>Because of the tip of the vectors are equals.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.690

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.770
<v Speaker 1>That they start at the origin?

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.990

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100]}

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 0>So if we think about when we talk about coordinate

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.469

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 0>That's a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 0>So I have some vector I have a tip I

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.030

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.890

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.780
<v Speaker 0>What are we thinking now?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 0>Are those two vectors the same or different?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.400
<v Speaker 0>The same?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.780
<v Speaker 0>The same?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.190
<v Speaker 0>Same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.840
<v Speaker 0>Anyone think different?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.590
<v Speaker 0>They are indeed the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 0>So they have different tails and tips, but they have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.720
<v Speaker 0>the same length and the same direction.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.640
<v Speaker 0>And that is all that matters for vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,61,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, you just want the same length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.010
<v Speaker 0>And pointing in the same direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.560
<v Speaker 0>So actually this is a much more general definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 0>Actually, I appreciate most of you.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 0>You've probably seen this before, but let's just take a

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.720
<v Speaker 0>moment to think about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.030
<v Speaker 0>So so you know, U and V are the same,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.450
<v Speaker 0>but also W is the same and W is over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.640
<v Speaker 0>here where there were no coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 0>Uh, let's see if I can do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.530
<v Speaker 0>Vector A is the same as UV and W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.720
<v Speaker 0>That is not even that is definitely not got any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,89,100,100,78,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.440
<v Speaker 0>coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.750
<v Speaker 0>That's on a completely different sheet of paper.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.290
<v Speaker 0>In fact, uh, let's take this a step further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.720
<v Speaker 0>Now I have to line this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.600
<v Speaker 0>This vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.810
<v Speaker 0>Isn't the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100]}

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.560
<v Speaker 0>This vector is the same as all of those vectors,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.940
<v Speaker 0>but it's moving around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100]}

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.380
<v Speaker 0>There are no coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100]}

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.610
<v Speaker 0>It's just a vector in space.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.340
<v Speaker 0>Which is why vectors are so useful, actually, because you

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.600
<v Speaker 0>do not need to have coordinates and you don't always

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.260
<v Speaker 0>have coordinates.

<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry for those of you who came to study

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.670
<v Speaker 0>aren't that many numerical calculations.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, I appreciate that we've just done eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.050

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, but that's not always true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 0>And actually vectors are one of these things we generalise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.710
<v Speaker 0>So for example, lots of the research I do is

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.010

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 0>And we can't put numbers on them because that makes

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 0>no sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.050
<v Speaker 0>But I can still work with vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.050
<v Speaker 0>So vectors are wonderful because you can do loads of

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.330
<v Speaker 0>fun stuff with them and you don't need numbers.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.010
<v Speaker 0>All you need is them to have the same length

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.770
<v Speaker 0>And you need one other rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.530
<v Speaker 0>You need to know how they how they how you

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 0>combine them so we can add them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.420
<v Speaker 0>By what number haven't I got?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,96,100,100,100]}

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 0>I've not got x the tip to tail rule, which

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.240
<v Speaker 0>sounds like a very kind of nursery rhyme maths rule,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.470
<v Speaker 0>but actually applies all applies way beyond numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, you can always add vectors by moving them tip

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.870
<v Speaker 0>to tail and then adding them up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.240
<v Speaker 0>So this is going to be w plus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.430

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.850
<v Speaker 0>that.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:54.900
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.960
<v Speaker 0>The caution tips do not need to be the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.770
<v Speaker 0>coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.180
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 0>So I appreciate this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 0>May give some of you flashbacks, to which I mildly

<v Speaker 0>apologise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but let's try matching the following.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.180
<v Speaker 0>So we have a hexagon with two vectors defined A

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.480
<v Speaker 0>and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.560
<v Speaker 0>There are no coordinates here.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.310
<v Speaker 0>There are no numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100]}

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.380
<v Speaker 0>I am not telling you how big this hexagon is.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.520
<v Speaker 0>In fact, it looks very different on both screens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, so can you match the following?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.740
<v Speaker 0>Can you find the vector a b?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.660
<v Speaker 0>Are we all happy with this notation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.460
<v Speaker 0>A b with the arrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.760
<v Speaker 0>It was in the textbook.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.730
<v Speaker 0>It's basically just the fact that starts today and ends

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,40,100,100,100]}

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.150
<v Speaker 0>a b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's try matching the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.450

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.170
<v Speaker 0>Four vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100]}

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.480
<v Speaker 0>To find some options.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:52.960
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.140
<v Speaker 0>There are just three options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.630

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.320
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.890
<v Speaker 0>Worth thinking about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay I'm going to give you another 30s I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.030
<v Speaker 0>until a bit longer for not halfway, but I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.320
<v Speaker 0>we'll be halfway by then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,99,72]}

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.620
<v Speaker 0>Another 10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.209
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 0>Lots of people voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:16.069
<v Speaker 0>We seem to have four matches that lots, if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.459
<v Speaker 0>like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:16.970
<v Speaker 0>And then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.939
<v Speaker 0>And then some other matches.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:20.810
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.760
<v Speaker 0>Which is good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 0>Yay!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 0>The vast majority of you are right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.069
<v Speaker 0>Hooray!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 0>So if we want to kind of just a quick

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 0>example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, a b is this vector from A to B,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,42,42,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.450
<v Speaker 0>um, which is having based on what we said before,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 0>is the going to be the same as each day?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,89]}

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 0>And I can start at a, I can do minus,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.860
<v Speaker 0>I start at the point A and go along the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,73,65,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.650
<v Speaker 0>vector A negatively.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.960
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to be minus a and then a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.620
<v Speaker 0>long b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100]}

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.650
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to add on b and I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 0>to have minus a plus b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.540
<v Speaker 0>Or another way of thinking about this is what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.980
<v Speaker 0>the vector b minus a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.560
<v Speaker 0>Well it's the vector that goes along here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:16.040
<v Speaker 0>And then afterwards goes uh, no, it's the vector that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Speaker 0>goes along here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.030
<v Speaker 0>And then afterwards goes down there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.640
<v Speaker 0>And that's going to be equivalent O to C is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,80,100]}

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.470
<v Speaker 0>the same as A, B and D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,96,96,100,52]}

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.910
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.470
<v Speaker 0>So we are good with vectors as kind of abstract

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.830
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.050
<v Speaker 0>There's no coordinates with a hexagon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,82,100]}

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 0>It's just an abstract line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.190
<v Speaker 0>Um which is nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 0>So it means we can do things however we want,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.660
<v Speaker 0>um, in whatever space we want and we don't need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,41,100,97,99]}

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.640
<v Speaker 0>We don't need vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100]}

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.270
<v Speaker 0>I've written here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.820
<v Speaker 0>We can shake off the shackles of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.980
<v Speaker 0>I was obviously feeling poetic then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:59.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, but yes, we're not constrained by our, um, axes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:00.860
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.980
<v Speaker 0>So we have this parallelogram rule, which allows us to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.440
<v Speaker 0>add things, as we saw in that question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.070
<v Speaker 0>We can also just change the direction by taking negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:16.190
<v Speaker 0>I could, uh, double it just by extending it double

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.790
<v Speaker 0>the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.820
<v Speaker 0>All the things we want to happen, happen like we

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.420
<v Speaker 0>want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:22.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.770
<v Speaker 0>So let's move on to a kind of maybe slightly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.400
<v Speaker 0>newer concept, um, which is we were talking about length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,96,96,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 0>So let's talk about how we measure the length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is measured by the norm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 0>So the norm of a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 0>Um, and anyone know how we take the norm of

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 0>a vector?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 0>What theorem are we essentially using?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 0>Pythagoras.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we are Pythagoras using.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,42]}

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 0>So one way of viewing this is is just the

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 0>square root of the first coordinate squared plus the second

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.900
<v Speaker 0>coordinate squared, plus all the way up to however many

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 0>coordinates we're working in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100]}

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 0>And the book talks about our two and our three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,96,100,96,96]}

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 0>vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 0>But actually this holds for any size vector, however long

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 0>your list of numbers is, the length is still just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.710
<v Speaker 0>x one times x two times x one squared plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,60,100,100,100,100,52,52,100,100]}

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 0>x two squared plus x three squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,66,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, the other way we can view this is actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 0>as the dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Um and again some people actually take this to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 0>the definition of of the norm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 0>Instead of saying it's how long our vector is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 0>They say it's the square root of the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.010
<v Speaker 0>the dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.040
<v Speaker 0>So bear in mind sometimes that's the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,82,100,86,100,100]}

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.950
<v Speaker 0>Instead, we actually just have this as a result of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.170
<v Speaker 0>theorem 4.2.1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.520
<v Speaker 0>It's part four of that theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, that says we can actually just take the dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:00.690
<v Speaker 0>product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, why is the dot product?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.490
<v Speaker 0>Why are these two equivalent?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100,100]}

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.150
<v Speaker 0>Why is the dot product the same as Pythagoras using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,94]}

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:09.990
<v Speaker 0>things?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.240
<v Speaker 0>If you think about what the dot product is, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.820
<v Speaker 0>time seeing the first entry of the first vector with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.520
<v Speaker 0>the first entry of the first vector, which is x1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.160
<v Speaker 0>times x1, which is x1 squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.300
<v Speaker 0>So yeah, we're doing exactly what we're thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.020
<v Speaker 0>It's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.530
<v Speaker 0>Kind of follows from the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 0>So here we're doing a bit of Pythagoras.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 0>Let's think about some other, uh, trigonometric rules we know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 0>This one has lots of nice consequences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay, there's my vector A and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 0>What is this vector going to be?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 0>Anyone want to tell me what my third vector is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 0>to close my triangle in terms of a and B?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 0>Good good good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 0>So there is my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 0>It's a minus b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 0>This is why you should always shout to me when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,92,49,100,100]}

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 0>I make a silly mistake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so there's a minus B if I have this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 0>angle here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 0>Uh, who again?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,83,100]}

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 0>This is probably something you might have seen before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 0>The cosine rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 0>Yay!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 0>Pythagoras corrected for all other triangles, essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 0>So, um, let's actually write this in terms of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 0>minus B uh squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 0>What is the cosine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 0>Will then going to tell me what's this equal to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 0>A squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 0>Plus b squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 0>2AB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 0>Cause it's the causal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,99,100,57]}

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 0>And then and then cos theta angle there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.230
<v Speaker 0>So that's the cosine rule again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,96,100]}

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully this is a bit of a vision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,78]}

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 0>Um but I have written this down wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 0>So we two we need the norm of a, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 0>need the norm of B and then we need cos

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 0>theta because we want the length of these sides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we need the norms okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 0>So that is shown in the, in the textbook.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.650
<v Speaker 0>And um a slight poof is given, but we actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.670
<v Speaker 0>have a couple of results that are very important that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.080
<v Speaker 0>come from the cosine rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.500
<v Speaker 0>So the first one is of course sports inequality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 0>Cauchy is one of those mathematical mathematicians that if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 0>do enough maths, you kind of think, what did he

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 0>do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 0>There were so many things named Cauchy something or another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 0>I think I'll double check this, but I think he's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 0>the mathematician with the most things named after him.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 0>Pretty sure that's Cauchy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, so lots of things named after him.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, and he has this inequality that says the dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 0>product is less than a b, uh, the norm of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,51,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 0>A and the norm of B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone tell me why my vertical lines are different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 0>here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 0>That isn't me being silly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is actually meaning there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 0>Y yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.420
<v Speaker 0>So A and B are vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 0>So we need to take the norm of the vectors,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 0>whereas HB what type of thing is HB?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 0>It's a scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 0>So yeah, I'm taking the absolute value there rather than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 0>a norm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 0>It's not a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 0>So those lines are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 0>So we're not going to prove Cauchy-Schwarz because that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.750

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.810

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 0>The norm of a plus B is less than A

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 0>plus B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:04.940
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is actually proposition 20, proposition 20 in Euclid

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

<v Speaker 0>book one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 0>So we're going back to like real antiquity maths here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 0>and proving something literally in the original textbook.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is a very well known, um, inequality.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 0>And actually, if you go on and do any other

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 0>kind of bits of maths with metric spaces and norms

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 0>and things like that, the triangle inequality becomes very important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, But the proof of it isn't too tricky.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.750
<v Speaker 0>So I thought we could do it together, actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.840
<v Speaker 0>And because it uses stuff we've already done.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to leave that up there.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.750
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, I think about this proof.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.080
<v Speaker 0>Do I need to find anything before I get into

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.400
<v Speaker 0>the meat of this proof?

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.830
<v Speaker 0>What are we going to be working with?

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.470
<v Speaker 0>So anything we don't, we need to tell the reader

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.350
<v Speaker 0>The only thing is A and B, um, it's given

<v Speaker 0>in the theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.180
<v Speaker 0>So, um, some people might say you don't have to

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.310

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.990
<v Speaker 0>So let A and B be in RN.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.480

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.990

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.370

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.240

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.330
<v Speaker 0>it.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 0>The dot product.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.590

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.460

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.630

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:28.250
<v Speaker 0>done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:29.930
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.310
<v Speaker 0>There is a complete proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.910
<v Speaker 0>We defined everything we wanted we had to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.000
<v Speaker 0>We justified each step by saying what we used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.400
<v Speaker 0>But essentially it was just one big calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that proves triangle inequality, which is quite a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:44.660
<v Speaker 0>fun thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.680
<v Speaker 0>Any questions on that or thoughts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.160
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.420
<v Unknown>On my last line with somebody please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,58,36,39,32]}

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.760
<v Unknown>Um, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.110
<v Speaker 0>This equal sign here, this thing here is exactly equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.860
<v Speaker 0>to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.320
<v Speaker 0>So we are going to keep the equal sign there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.050
<v Speaker 0>But we've proved overall this thing is an equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.470
<v Speaker 0>this thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.780
<v Speaker 0>It's less than or equal because we made the less

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.010
<v Speaker 0>than or equal assumption there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's a good question though.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.200
<v Speaker 0>I mean, yes, you could put a less than or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 0>equal sign there, but it's just always equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.460
<v Speaker 0>So you probably should put it in equal sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:22.670
goes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:29.540
<v Speaker 0>Hokey pokey.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, uh, let us return just for a second,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.510
<v Speaker 0>then to the cosine rule and look at a third

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:50.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, what happens if, um, my angle is pi by

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.140
<v Speaker 0>two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.210
<v Speaker 0>What does that mean for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.440
<v Speaker 0>These two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.280
<v Speaker 0>So one of the things we saw in the textbook

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.040
<v Speaker 0>we got from here was that the the a, b,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.360
<v Speaker 0>we could rearrange the cosine rule and get the norm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.490

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.220
<v Speaker 0>So if my angle is pi by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:27.840
<v Speaker 0>What is my dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.730
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.060
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.200
<v Speaker 0>So this is a kind of big thing about orthogonality,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.560
<v Speaker 0>which is how many people have heard the word orthogonal

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.640
<v Speaker 0>before this week.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Speaker 0>Some of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.210
<v Speaker 0>How many people have heard the word perpendicular?

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.130
<v Speaker 0>Most of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you've got to love maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,98,98,100,100]}

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.060
<v Speaker 0>You learn a technical word and then we upgrade it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.360
<v Speaker 0>Perpendicular gets upgraded to orthogonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.340
<v Speaker 0>They're essentially the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, they just mean the angle is they're at a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.280
<v Speaker 0>right angle to each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.690
<v Speaker 0>So if you are perpendicular orthogonal, we will talk a

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.690
<v Speaker 0>lot more about orthogonality in the rest of the term.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, if your particular orthogonal then your dot product has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,54,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.230

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.040
<v Speaker 0>And we know that the dot product is given by

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 0>the norms times cause.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,85,75]}

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's do one more question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's not the question I wanted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.330
<v Speaker 0>This is the question I wanted.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you cannot see that, uh, A, B and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.970
<v Speaker 0>C are going to be unit vectors with a b

<v Speaker 0>equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100]}

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.130
<v Speaker 0>So a and B are orthogonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:52.290
<v Speaker 0>Can you find can there be um a way of

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:57.330

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.870
<v Speaker 0>So if you think about that that means you're going

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.030
<v Speaker 0>to follow the three vectors around and end up back

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:03.810

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.120
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to give you have a chat with

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.370
<v Speaker 0>let C equal that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.420
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.750
<v Speaker 0>If c is the hypotenuse, if c equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay, let us look at this.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.400
<v Speaker 0>Because I be orthogonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,52,85,100]}

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.650
<v Speaker 0>I mean, the other person said if they were orthogonal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,94,100]}

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.600
<v Speaker 0>to the hypotenuse, it still works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, because the unit vectors length would need to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.380

<v Speaker 0>unit vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:43.160
<v Speaker 0>So all of the people for know mention something about

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.940
<v Speaker 0>length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.460
<v Speaker 0>Why does does length matter here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.100
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.730
<v Unknown>Because these are hypotenuse and it is always greater.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,52,52,100,50,100,100,100,88]}

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.950
<v Unknown>Okay good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,98]}

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.210
<v Speaker 0>So actually lots of everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.940
<v Speaker 0>Everyone all the comments were very correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.470
<v Speaker 0>Everyone was saying good things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.670
<v Speaker 0>I'm a bit sneaky.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm snuck in a word and didn't really, um, yell

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.780
<v Speaker 0>about it, but it makes a big difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, it is true if they are not unit vectors.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.890
<v Speaker 0>Because then yeah, you take C to be the hypotenuse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 0>You take C to be minus a minus plus b

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.290

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.140

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.520
<v Speaker 0>We are breaking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:40.010
<v Speaker 0>You're essentially saying you've got a unit vector here with

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.390

<v Speaker 0>length one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:50.210

00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:01.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yeah, it's true, provided I didn't sneak in

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.850

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.990

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,67]}

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.730
<v Speaker 0>So even if you were in higher dimensions, um, then

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.940
<v Speaker 0>you would still be forming a triangle and Pythagoras would

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.660

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 0>So kind of like in a sphere like this.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:23.010

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 0>one is a straight line, which is a relief.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.740

<v Speaker 0>So yes.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.540
<v Speaker 0>Oh good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 0>We also seem quite happy that the second one is

<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.680

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:32.550

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.680

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.650

<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.640

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.860

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.830

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}
