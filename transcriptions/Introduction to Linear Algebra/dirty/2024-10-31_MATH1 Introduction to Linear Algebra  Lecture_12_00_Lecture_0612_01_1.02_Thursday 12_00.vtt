<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 0>Am I going to do that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 0>I think I'm going to start maybe, um, doing this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 0>the time being.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 0>So for the content of this week, um, I've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 0>sort of two topics that are very closely interlinked, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70]}

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 0>is really just one topic that I'll just need two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 0>lectures to go over it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 0>So, um, today we're going to look at first of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 0>all subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to look at spanning and spanning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 0>sets of a subspace or office space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 0>And then tomorrow we're going to go into talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 0>linear independence and dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 0>And I think that's the title that Nicholson gives to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 0>that topic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100]}

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 0>The one the other important part of tomorrow is going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 0>to be the concept of bases, what they are and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 0>how they span subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100]}

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 0>So we're developing into that concept there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, now before I go into that, probably I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,68,100]}

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 0>to start let me see, where do we go?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100]}

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 0>I did have something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,98]}

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 0>Oh, there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 0>I had something to dim the lights a little bit,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 0>but you can see it, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I set, um, as the reading for this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 0>week, chapter five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 0>And then just really just one page of chapter six,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 0>which was this one here, which was sort of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 0>axioms for vector addition and vector and scalar multiplication and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.810
<v Speaker 0>so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.780
<v Speaker 0>You might thought you, you might think to yourself, what's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.710
<v Speaker 0>the point of this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.210
<v Speaker 0>How should I really read this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 0>Because you can read this as just saying, well, these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.650
<v Speaker 0>are just obvious rules of how to work with vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.170
<v Speaker 0>that we had all the way back in week one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.200
<v Speaker 0>There aren't all this stuff we've gone through that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,86,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 0>know how to work with vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.410
<v Speaker 0>Is this just a reminder?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.430
<v Speaker 0>And no, you can read this the other way around,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.400
<v Speaker 0>because so far in everything on most things that we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.660
<v Speaker 0>done, we've worked with vector spaces being r, n, b,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,36,69,39]}

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 0>r 2 or 3, or maybe in RN, but it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.530
<v Speaker 0>was always um, like vectors built out of numbers in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 0>the real in, in the real numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.780
<v Speaker 0>But actually the concept goes much further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.510
<v Speaker 0>We don't need to think about vector spaces, something in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.910
<v Speaker 0>R like RN or something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 0>We can try to apply the concept to something completely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.070
<v Speaker 0>abstract or something completely different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.010
<v Speaker 0>And then the question becomes somehow, what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,75]}

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 0>What are the rules of the game?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.830
<v Speaker 0>Like, what do I need to have from some abstract

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 0>concept in order to call this a vector space?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 0>And this is really what these are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 0>These are sort of rules of the game that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 0>can say, rather than saying, well, my vectors, um, have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 0>these properties, I can go the other way round and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 0>saying anything that has these properties I will call a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 0>vector space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.720
<v Speaker 0>And then once I've got that, I can say that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 0>most of the things we've developed so far in, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,58,95]}

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 0>particular, this sort of more abstract stuff that is coming

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 0>this week and next week will apply to this object,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 0>whatever it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.860
<v Speaker 0>As long as I know that I've got these properties

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 0>there now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54]}

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 0>So I could term for example, I mean, I could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,80,100,100,92,92,100,100]}

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 0>literally go and say, I want to calculate with apples

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.800
<v Speaker 0>and bananas how I call these things like these fruit,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 0>I call them vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 0>As long as you define to me what you mean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 0>by taking u plus v, what you mean by apple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.970
<v Speaker 0>plus a banana, and what you mean by saying if.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.450
<v Speaker 0>What happens if I multiply my apple or banana by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 0>a scalar?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 0>And if as long as you can do the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 0>thing consistent so that it satisfies all these properties, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.420
<v Speaker 0>it's going to be a vector space, and I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[31,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 0>do all my stuff where there's an everything that I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,25,44,33,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 0>done so far carries over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.370
<v Speaker 0>So this is again sort of an example of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 0>I say we're going to go away from working with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 0>concrete objects, real numbers, and going more and more into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.990
<v Speaker 0>working with their properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 0>So a little bit more, more concrete.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 0>What are other things that you are working with?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.420
<v Speaker 0>The obvious thing is that Nicholson says these are functional

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,99,100,78,100,100]}

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 0>spaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 0>So these vectors u and v I could think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.520
<v Speaker 0>as a function general function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.010
<v Speaker 0>Or if you want to do a little bit more,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 0>more, more concrete polynomials, for example, know these are obvious

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,36,97,87,100]}

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.010
<v Speaker 0>things that I can write.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 0>Think about this and they will satisfy all the properties

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 0>of a vector space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 0>And these are concepts that come quite often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 0>Other things will be matrices rather than vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 0>A little bit looking the same as vectors, or just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100]}

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 0>have larger larger area of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 0>But again this is something where that would apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 0>So that is just the background.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 0>And apart from this I'm going to go right back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 0>to our N and keep there for this week and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,44,98,100,100,99,100,100,92,88]}

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 0>next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 0>But you will have these concepts coming up now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 0>So just remind just as a reminder that we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 0>this as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 0>Right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 0>So let's go straight into subsets and actually well not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 0>quite into the first problem I do that in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 0>second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 0>So I've got a set like this here now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 0>And it's probably worthwhile at this point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.580
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just going to say a few things about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.940
<v Speaker 0>the notation, because Nicholson introduces that and is quite often

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.170
<v Speaker 0>used, and it's probably quite useful if we talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 0>this, I'm going to get away from the, uh, from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.130
<v Speaker 0>that pole there and talk about notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 0>So if I'm talking about sets, right, I'll do the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100]}

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 0>other way round actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,54,100]}

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, because I can't see what I'm writing otherwise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.440
<v Speaker 0>Give me a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,71]}

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.470
<v Speaker 0>There we go and there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 0>If I'm talking about sets, um, so I can write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 0>down a set as having a set bracket and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.960
<v Speaker 0>list all the elements that I have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.930
<v Speaker 0>So for example, I can do something like two, four,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 0>six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 0>And say this is the set of um, those numbers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 0>in particular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.600
<v Speaker 0>Uh, quite often I can't really list all the elements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.290
<v Speaker 0>in a set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I can do something, um, which Nicholson calls

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,68,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 0>the set builder notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,95,97]}

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.390
<v Speaker 0>So, um, I can do something like that, that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 0>can say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.560
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.550
<v Speaker 0>I want the set of all say n in n,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 0>so all natural numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, then I put a condition on it, um, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.830
<v Speaker 0>that, for example, I can say n is divisible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.760
<v Speaker 0>By two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, end of the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.980
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 0>So in this case for this notation I've sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.140
<v Speaker 0>got a base set here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, and also have a condition here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, and in the middle I've got this, uh, vertical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 0>line there, um, that is usually pronounced as such that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 0>So I can read this as this is the set

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 0>of all n in the natural numbers such that n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 0>is divisible by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.600
<v Speaker 0>So set of all or even numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.230
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.120
<v Speaker 0>Some people use a different notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.190
<v Speaker 0>For example, instead of a vertical line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 0>Here, some people just use a colon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.280
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's just perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,89,100,63]}

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.350
<v Speaker 0>Personal preference means the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.700
<v Speaker 0>Pronounce the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I can have a slight variation on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.600
<v Speaker 0>whole thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that, for example, I could say something like this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.980
<v Speaker 0>is the set of anything that I can write as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.710
<v Speaker 0>two n, uh, such that n is a natural number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, of course, that would be the same set in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.460
<v Speaker 0>this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, and sometimes one or the other, um, is more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 0>natural of trying to write the sets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.750
<v Speaker 0>Um, so just as a reminder, what is meant if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.250
<v Speaker 0>I write something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Speaker 0>So in this case, I'm going to look at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 0>set here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, of all vectors in r n um, I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,37,100,58,100,100]}

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.370
<v Speaker 0>to call this set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.750
<v Speaker 0>And this is not the natural number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.460
<v Speaker 0>This is just a set called n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,99,84,56]}

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 0>So all vectors such that for a given matrix A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.610
<v Speaker 0>times x is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.490
<v Speaker 0>So the question is this set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.970
<v Speaker 0>Such a set is that a subspace or is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.080
<v Speaker 0>not a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.190
<v Speaker 0>And right now at this point I will need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.600
<v Speaker 0>switch things over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.620
<v Speaker 0>So um, I'm going to go and give you the

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.650
<v Speaker 0>pole here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100]}

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.560
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to go this here and bring up

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.400
<v Speaker 0>a clip.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[26,50]}

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:45.910

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 0>I know, multiple answers.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>This play now.

<v Speaker 0>Do you need a reminder?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.130
<v Speaker 0>You might need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.980
<v Speaker 0>But how do I do that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.680
<v Speaker 0>All right, there's my lecture polls.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,99,100,100,100,47]}

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and you don't see the other thing, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:40.030
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 0>We've got that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100]}

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 0>We've got this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 0>And, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 0>Probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.350
<v Speaker 0>We are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79]}

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.390
<v Speaker 0>I've got 40.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.010
<v Speaker 0>But I'll show you the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,78,100,100,100,95]}

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.970

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.620
<v Speaker 0>And sorry for those who haven't been able to vote

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.200
<v Speaker 0>is because they didn't have the poll.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, but I get I get to that in a

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:12.870
<v Speaker 0>second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.190
<v Speaker 0>I'll just play that in a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so most of you think this is always a

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.040
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and indeed it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.000
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'll tell you a little bit more about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.400
<v Speaker 0>In fact, this is what is called the null space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,87,100,100]}

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if you have anything like we've seen that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.450
<v Speaker 0>um, a times x, a multiplying with a vector is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.710
<v Speaker 0>a linear transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.030
<v Speaker 0>And indeed any linear transformation asking what elements are mapped

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.300
<v Speaker 0>onto zero, that is going to be a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if I do this slightly different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I say now consider the set of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.090
<v Speaker 0>elements, all vectors which are mapped onto a vector b,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 0>um, where b is not the zero vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.020
<v Speaker 0>So is this a subspace or is this not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.860
<v Speaker 0>subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.170
<v Speaker 0>And um, again I'm going to go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.280
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to reset this poll.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm going to start this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 0>And while you're doing that, I will try to display.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.370
<v Speaker 1>This here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 0>So that you can take part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,99]}

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 0>20s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.310
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 0>So, um, end of the time, let's have a look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,40,83,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 0>at the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.540
<v Speaker 0>So you're much less clear about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:36.600
<v Speaker 0>So just about most think that is never a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.330
<v Speaker 0>Something almost the same must always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100]}

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.850
<v Speaker 0>And something this depends on something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.610
<v Speaker 0>So probably at this point it's worth looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.700
<v Speaker 0>Actually, water subspace is like going back in and seeing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 0>what we know about these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:58.560
<v Speaker 0>So uh, right, okay, let's just keep this up here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.760
<v Speaker 0>and let's have a look, um, at my subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.180
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.890
<v Speaker 0>So a subspace, um, I'm saying is a set of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.100
<v Speaker 0>vectors, which in principle could be any set of vectors,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.540
<v Speaker 0>um, is a subspace or if the following are satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.160
<v Speaker 0>So I've got a couple of axioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, one being zero should be in the subspace, one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.930
<v Speaker 0>being that if I've got x and y in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.990
<v Speaker 0>space or in the set of vectors, then um, there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,76]}

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.570
<v Speaker 0>are some is also in the subspace, um, and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.910
<v Speaker 0>other one, if I've got an x in the subspace

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 0>and a the scalar and scalar times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,97,100,97,54]}

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 0>Like this awesome subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,63,99,97]}

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 0>So in other words, we're saying that this space should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 0>be closed with respect to vector addition and scalar multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 0>Just adding to vectors or more deploying a vector by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 0>a scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 0>It's not going to take me out of that subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 0>Now that should remind you of something that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 0>done previously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I just go back here, um, namely, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Speaker 0>linear, the definition of linear transformations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's a certain certain, um, relation between the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,90,100,100,100,50,100,100,94]}

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 0>asymmetry between that here as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 0>We've looked at sort of where we're saying we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,82,97,100,100]}

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 0>X and y elements of a subspace or element of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.090
<v Speaker 0>a vector space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.080
<v Speaker 0>We're looking at what happens to x plus y, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 0>happens to axe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's a certain symmetry here with the axioms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.660
<v Speaker 0>two and three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 0>And indeed one way of doing this, of thinking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.490
<v Speaker 0>subspace, is that this is anything that you can define

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 0>the concepts of linear transformations on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.710
<v Speaker 0>You know, in order to be able to check this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 0>here, if you've got X plus y, we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 0>be able to at least say that x plus y,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 0>we can do the transformation on it all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 0>So we're not not looking at actually what it does,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 0>but just we need to be able to evaluate our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.870
<v Speaker 0>transformation x plus y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 0>And the same thing if we look at the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 0>one, if we multiplying it with a scalar, we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 0>to be able to evaluate that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 0>So to some extent these things that we've got there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 0>are the conditions so that we can talk about linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 0>transformation on a subspace at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 0>A subspace is something where we can sensibly talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 0>whether something is a linear transformation or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 0>So one possible application might be something if you're doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 0>computer graphics and you're not doing this stuff and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,49,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 0>whole run, but you now wanting to do, I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,79,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 0>know, a rotation or something on a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, in in MN.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,50]}

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 0>This is a subset of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 0>And he wanted to think, are these things linear?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 0>What are the relations?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77]}

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 0>How does it work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.740
<v Speaker 0>There are in order for being able to do that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.370
<v Speaker 0>the space you're working in must be a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.150
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.680
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.600
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, if I've got this sort of symmetry between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.060
<v Speaker 0>that, you notice that one thing isn't symmetric.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.720
<v Speaker 0>Namely here I've got this axiom one there that says

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.330
<v Speaker 0>zero has to be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.660
<v Speaker 0>And here I'm not saying anything about zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.350
<v Speaker 0>And indeed we've noticed when we've done that there that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.170
<v Speaker 0>we don't need to say anything about zero because that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.050
<v Speaker 0>just follows from those axioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100]}

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:21.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.580
<v Speaker 0>I can use for example, the second one then saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.220
<v Speaker 0>let's like set a equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.580
<v Speaker 0>And I know that helps me that t of zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.140
<v Speaker 0>has to equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.050
<v Speaker 0>So can we do something similar over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:42.200
<v Speaker 0>Can we just derive, um, that first thing there from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.980
<v Speaker 0>the others?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, what do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.510
<v Speaker 0>Anybody thinks we can do that over here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,60]}

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Like, if you assume a certain minus x?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,76,58,100,100]}

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so if we had x in the set and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.330
<v Speaker 0>minus x in the set, we could do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,74,99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.160
<v Speaker 0>Do we know that minus x is on the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.270
<v Speaker 0>Yeah a can be minus one indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.800
<v Speaker 0>No it does work doesn't it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.230
<v Speaker 0>So we can do something like, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.610
<v Speaker 0>What do I need to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.700
<v Speaker 0>I probably don't want this here a laptop.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,43,91]}

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.620
<v Speaker 0>Go to the camera.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.990
<v Speaker 0>Just give me a second so I could do something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.300
<v Speaker 0>like saying, well, if I've got an X in my,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.970

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, I know that, um, minus one times x, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.110
<v Speaker 0>must be in the space.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, minus one times x, obviously is minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,88,95,100,100]}

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.360
<v Speaker 0>That must be in the space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,67,100]}

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.750
<v Speaker 0>Um, by the third axiom there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.060
<v Speaker 0>And if I've got those two, then I've got that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.530
<v Speaker 0>x minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's just the sum of two elements on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.160
<v Speaker 0>the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is the zero vector that's also element on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.360
<v Speaker 0>the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.820
<v Speaker 0>So it does seem to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.740
<v Speaker 0>It looks like that the first one there, um, just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 0>falls out or the other thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,68,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.440
<v Speaker 0>So does that make the first axiom here redundant?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.990
<v Speaker 0>Could I just do it without.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.880
<v Speaker 0>Could I just what I've done in the sorry I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.380
<v Speaker 0>The linear transformation that I just have axioms two and

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.890
<v Speaker 0>three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 0>Right.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:45.520
<v Speaker 0>Or in other words, does one action, one that tells

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 0>That's the reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 0>So you need to assume in order what I've done

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:07.930
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 0>I need to assume that an X are actually half

<v Speaker 0>You know what it does include what it does exclude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,78,100,100,100,100,99,99,100,80]}

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 0>The whole thing is that I couldn't have the empty

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.090
<v Speaker 0>If I just have two and three, then just having

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 0>the empty set would be a subset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 0>There's just simply no element.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76]}

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 0>So anything anything holds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, but my first one there says I've got a

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.070

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 0>And now, because I know that if ever I have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 0>a subset, zero has got to be in the subset

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.140
<v Speaker 0>by what I've just done here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's natural to to say that I've got a

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.060

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.830
<v Speaker 0>So an empty set is not a subset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 0>So, um, now that we've done that, that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 0>some idea now what subsets are um, it or subspaces

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 0>or sorry, I shouldn't call subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 0>There are different subsets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,91,99,90]}

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, that I talked about subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, I should probably go back now and can track

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 0>the conditions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,96]}

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 0>So, um, what does happen if I go back here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 0>and, um, look at this set that I had at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 0>the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I've got that there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100]}

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 0>So can we now say something about that set?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 0>So why is this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 0>Why is this a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.200
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we've got the set here, um, of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 0>vectors in RN, uh, such that a x equal to

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.940
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 0>Now everything works the same if I don't expect this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 0>axis to be in RN, but sitting in any vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 0>space and more than eight times x, I'm looking at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.700
<v Speaker 0>any linear transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 0>That's sort of the the beauty of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.400
<v Speaker 0>I'm doing it concretely or relatively concrete, but you will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 0>see that everything happens in the more everything works in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 0>the more general setting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at my subspace axioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to prove?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 0>Uh, first of all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 0>So S1 does that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100]}

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 0>How Howard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,42]}

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 0>As one says, it's zero in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 0>So I need to check what happens if I apply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 0>A to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.220
<v Speaker 0>So a times the zero vector is the zero vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 0>So indeed that holds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 0>So zero is element of the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 0>So I should write the zeroth element of n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.750
<v Speaker 0>So next thing I want to show um s two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,49,56]}

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.470
<v Speaker 0>is if I've got two, um, if I've got uh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:58.840
<v Speaker 0>x and y in n, um, so if I've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,100,96,100,100]}

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.800
<v Speaker 0>x and y in N, um, then I know that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.100
<v Speaker 0>because they're in the subspace, I know that axe equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.880
<v Speaker 0>to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.150
<v Speaker 0>And I know that a y equals to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:11.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.290
<v Speaker 0>So now I want to take what happens to x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.130
<v Speaker 0>plus y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.350
<v Speaker 0>So x plus y um in order to see whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.980
<v Speaker 0>that's in the space, I need to multiply it with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.320
<v Speaker 0>a, um, and see what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, now I can take this apart a x plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,81,100]}

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 0>a y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 0>I know this is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.060
<v Speaker 0>I know this is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.190
<v Speaker 0>So this is zero plus zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that's a zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.920
<v Speaker 0>So, um, x plus y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.000
<v Speaker 0>So I have here that x plus y is also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.660
<v Speaker 0>in n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75]}

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Speaker 0>Well so that worked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then finally, um, I can have a look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.940
<v Speaker 0>at the third one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.540
<v Speaker 0>So I've got X in my space or in my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.150
<v Speaker 0>subspace and a scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,86]}

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that means um, as before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, if x is in N, um, I know that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.410
<v Speaker 0>axe is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then I can have a look at what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.770
<v Speaker 0>happens to axe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, again, I can multiply it with a to check

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,96]}

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.710
<v Speaker 0>what the result is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.660
<v Speaker 0>I know that I can take the A out here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,82,98]}

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.320
<v Speaker 0>So this is a um, times a x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,97,100,100]}

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, I know that a x is zero, so this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 0>is a times zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, so again this is part of the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.140
<v Speaker 0>So okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.960
<v Speaker 0>So um, we've checked all the axioms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we've proven that, um, this set that I've,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,99,70,100,100]}

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.590
<v Speaker 0>um, haven't got here anymore, that that is indeed always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.440
<v Speaker 0>a subspace just come straight out of the properties of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.850
<v Speaker 0>linear transformations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.640
<v Speaker 0>Now, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.680
<v Speaker 0>Now that we know a little bit about subspaces, let

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.260
<v Speaker 0>us look again at this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, and um, first of all, before we weren't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.800
<v Speaker 0>sure what's happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.060
<v Speaker 0>So are you clearer about that now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.990
<v Speaker 0>So let's just go back, um, and do the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:25.830
<v Speaker 0>poll again that we hard reset and display.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,96,100,100]}

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.920
<v Speaker 0>So if I have the right hand side equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,52,100,100]}

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.590
<v Speaker 0>zero, is this a subspace or is this not a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.340
<v Speaker 0>subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.860
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 0>10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so you're now much clearer about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 0>This is never a subspace, which is indeed the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 0>answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody give me a quick reason why this cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 0>be a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 0>Zero zero would not be part of the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 0>And that's a that's a quick, quick check for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 0>lot of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 0>So again, just to um, just for completeness, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.110
<v Speaker 0>So um, if I've got this set here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, my set B, which I've now defined as x,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,97,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.170
<v Speaker 0>all vectors in our n such that a x equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,100,86,89,100]}

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 0>to b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 0>And I want to check that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, so my first property there that I had was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 0>I need to check whether zero, um is sorry, whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 0>zero is part of the set, um, or it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,51,97]}

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 0>not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 0>But I just want to check that that is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 0>case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I need to check what happens if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 0>apply a to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 0>So if I say a times zero, um, that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 0>zero obviously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, and zero is not equal to b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we said b up to B, not um, not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,95,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 0>part of the not not zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, so zero isn't in that set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 0>So this cannot be a subset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 0>So that's a quick quick and easy check here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:11.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's go further trying to recognise subsets or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,99]}

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 0>subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.140
<v Speaker 0>I keep saying that wrong subspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so here are a few.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:25.250
<v Speaker 0>Subsets of R2 given geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.180
<v Speaker 0>And I'd like you to tell me which or any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.230
<v Speaker 0>if any of these are subspaces, not just for each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.530
<v Speaker 0>of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.600
<v Speaker 0>I just want to tell me the number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 0>How many of these do you think are subspaces?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.800
<v Speaker 0>I've got five choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.490
<v Speaker 0>And it's only one correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:00.650
<v Speaker 0>I give you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,98,100]}

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.810
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you 1.5 minutes on this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.220
<v Unknown>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.150
<v Unknown>The whole thing is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.560
<v Speaker 0>Last 10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.180
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.700
<v Speaker 0>Uh, 1 or 2 is what you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, pretty much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.900
<v Speaker 0>Even so, there's one set where people are unclear about,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,80,100]}

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.000
<v Speaker 0>and I suspect I know which one that is, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.670
<v Speaker 0>let's let's go through them bit by bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.390
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.070
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.620
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, the first set is just the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.680
<v Speaker 0>circle, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.480
<v Speaker 0>Subspace or not subspace anyone?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,68]}

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.250
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.030
<v Speaker 0>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.700
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't have zero in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, we just set that zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.070
<v Speaker 0>That's a quick check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, actually, I can also do another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.050
<v Speaker 0>I can also say, well, if I had a vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.230
<v Speaker 0>here, this one here, if it was a subspace, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.660
<v Speaker 0>if I scale, that vector would still have to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.560
<v Speaker 0>in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.890
<v Speaker 0>So if I did something like this here, um, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.120
<v Speaker 0>should be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.510
<v Speaker 0>Isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.040
<v Speaker 0>So this isn't a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100]}

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 0>What did I have?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100,100]}

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 0>Line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 0>Just the line, not through the origin subspace are not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 0>subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 0>No, you're not saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, I'm not asking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 0>Uh, same counterexample is previously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,80,51,100]}

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, zero isn't in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 0>And indeed sort of drawing a vector here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 0>I can't scale the vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,80,100]}

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 0>So not a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm going to do this one first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.000
<v Speaker 0>Just the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, just the vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.390
<v Speaker 0>Zero, zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.320
<v Speaker 0>Nothing else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.260
<v Speaker 0>Is that a subspace or is that not a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.300
<v Speaker 0>It is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:16.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, so because a similar with zero, I can I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,88,100,100,100,98,99,100]}

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.740
<v Speaker 0>not going to I wasn't going to check the, um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,61,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.600
<v Speaker 0>the things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.160
<v Speaker 0>No, I'll just keep it as that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.430
<v Speaker 0>So this is, um, this is a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:36.970
<v Speaker 0>So I suspect the one that people found confusing was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:42.160
<v Speaker 0>this one here where I just have the x axis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.080
<v Speaker 0>and the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.580
<v Speaker 0>So, um, subspace or not subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.570
<v Speaker 0>I think this is the one where we were half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:53.170
<v Speaker 0>Half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.190
<v Speaker 0>So you think not a subspace Y?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61]}

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.640
<v Speaker 0>Not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.190
<v Speaker 0>Second condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:09.429
<v Speaker 0>Second condition?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I've got two elements in a subspace, their

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,45]}

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.770
<v Speaker 0>addition has also to be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.419
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, that doesn't hold you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,98,52]}

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.159
<v Speaker 0>So you might think here, because zero's in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,98,100,100]}

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.070
<v Speaker 0>And if I can scale any vector, I can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.870
<v Speaker 0>That would still be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.169
<v Speaker 0>Um, but if I have something like this, here's my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100]}

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:30.250
<v Speaker 0>vector x here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.770
<v Speaker 0>And that one here is my vector y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, then this here, that one there would be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.610
<v Speaker 0>vector x plus y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:42.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that is not in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:43.179
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.429
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.530
<v Speaker 0>So if they're not in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.250
<v Speaker 0>I could try to add things to the set to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100]}

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.659
<v Speaker 0>make it into a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:55.000
<v Speaker 0>So I could add this vector x plus y into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.020
<v Speaker 0>the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.660
<v Speaker 0>And then probably all its multiples I need those as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:58.990
<v Speaker 0>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.970
<v Speaker 0>To make some sort of star.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.080
<v Speaker 0>Is that a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,97,99,99]}

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.720
<v Speaker 0>No, no, I can still combine stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.520
<v Speaker 0>How much would I have to add in order to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.050
<v Speaker 0>make this into a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.560
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.900
<v Speaker 0>All of our two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.710
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:18.520
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.340
<v Speaker 0>I would need to add all of R2 now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,44]}

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.190
<v Speaker 0>And that's a that's sort of what's guiding us for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.830
<v Speaker 0>the next for the rest of this of today is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.090
<v Speaker 0>what do I need to add onto some spaces in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.040
<v Speaker 0>order to make it into a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.970
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, and indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, I can now go and say the following here.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:49.900
<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100]}

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay, good.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.070
<v Speaker 0>Um, now, I've got two elements here, x and Y

<v Speaker 0>Um.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 0>And I want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,62]}

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.060
<v Speaker 0>So what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.100
<v Speaker 0>We have to include a path from x and Y

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.560
<v Speaker 0>I know that at the very least, I need to

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.010

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.110
<v Speaker 0>So I need to be able to scale them by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.270
<v Speaker 0>any, um, scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,95]}

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 0>And I need to be able to add things together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.830
<v Speaker 0>So I need to be able to have t x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.270
<v Speaker 0>plus s y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, need to also be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.520
<v Speaker 0>In other words, I need to have sort of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:30.880
<v Speaker 0>linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.610
<v Speaker 0>If I've got two elements in my subspace, I need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.610
<v Speaker 0>to have all linear combinations of these elements both in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,85]}

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 0>the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.890
<v Speaker 0>And indeed that sort of thing has a name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.940
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to skip this pole.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,69]}

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:46.900
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.580
<v Speaker 0>That is called the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,96]}

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.070
<v Speaker 0>And it's quite fitting that we do the whole thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:51.670
<v Speaker 0>on Halloween.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.710
<v Speaker 0>I think um, like this back there that spans something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.390
<v Speaker 0>which is a thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,65]}

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.780
<v Speaker 0>So a span if given, given a set of vectors,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.500
<v Speaker 0>the span is just the set of all linear combinations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.760
<v Speaker 0>of these vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.180
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, and um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.900
<v Speaker 0>So what do we know about the span then?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, well, the first thing is that given a vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 0>and the span and I'm going to call this just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.850
<v Speaker 0>to take me, I'm going to call the span just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.360
<v Speaker 0>u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.380
<v Speaker 0>We're saying the set U here as a subspace of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,98,99,89,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:26.830
<v Speaker 0>RN.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.600
<v Speaker 0>So it is a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.250
<v Speaker 0>The span is a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so probably shouldn't be all that surprised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.530
<v Speaker 0>That's how we that's how we constructed it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:35.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.200
<v Speaker 0>In order to be for it to be a subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.960
<v Speaker 0>But we can say more about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,92,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.390
<v Speaker 0>So there's this statement here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Speaker 0>Nicholson.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.760
<v Speaker 0>And again, I think this is one of the ones

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 0>that you sort of have to read a couple of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.840
<v Speaker 0>times to understand what this is saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.980
<v Speaker 0>So it says if I've got another subspace of RN

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 0>that contains these vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79]}

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 0>So I'm defining the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.280
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm taking just a random subspace that happens

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 0>to contain the vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 0>And I'm saying that the span actually has to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.370
<v Speaker 0>part of the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100]}

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 0>So in other words what this means is that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 0>span U there is the smallest subspace that has all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.530
<v Speaker 0>these vectors in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 0>So it's going to go back to what I said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 0>What I said earlier, um, with a with a cross

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 0>What do I have to add in order to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 0>this into a subspace?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.550
<v Speaker 0>The span is exactly what I have to add.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Given some vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.670
<v Speaker 0>The span, it's the smallest possible subspace that includes these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.360
<v Speaker 0>vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.220
<v Speaker 0>And I think I'm going to play a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.000
<v Speaker 0>with a span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100]}

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.240
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:45.930
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:51.060
<v Speaker 0>So um, what is the span of those two vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.930
<v Speaker 0>over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, and just give you a little bit of a,

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.040
<v Speaker 0>uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.350
<v Speaker 0>Just give you lots of options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.860
<v Speaker 0>Give a little bit of sort of a geometric thing.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.060
<v Speaker 0>So we're talking about we're talking about this vector here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.630
<v Speaker 0>That's one one and this vector here that is one

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.560
<v Speaker 0>minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, sorry, not quite 45 degree angle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.200
<v Speaker 0>So are we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.030
<v Speaker 0>If the span just the zero vector, the x axis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.120
<v Speaker 0>both acts that the triangle with a corner point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,100,99,100,72,100,57]}

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.900
<v Speaker 0>So that would be the sort of triangle um, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.470
<v Speaker 0>this here, um, the square with a corner point.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.630
<v Speaker 0>So that would be if I make this here into

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.170
<v Speaker 0>a square, um, and take this one here.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.950
<v Speaker 0>Is that that one, um, is just the cross shape

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,77,100,100,98,93,100,100,100,91]}

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.370
<v Speaker 0>union.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.290
<v Speaker 0>So that would be if I just make this sort

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.840
<v Speaker 0>of into into something like that.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.980
<v Speaker 0>Uh, or is it actually the whole of RN and

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.890
<v Speaker 0>that's got if I count correctly, you've got seven options

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Not showing you the pole is like another 10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,99,100,89,78,77,100,100]}

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.400
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.640
<v Speaker 0>So most people, at least two thirds, think gee is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 0>the right answer, the whole offer, and indeed that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,62,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.160
<v Speaker 0>the or the whole of R2, and indeed that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.360
<v Speaker 0>the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, now there's a few people here who thought F

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.830
<v Speaker 0>or e or D, um, so f f can be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.660
<v Speaker 0>a subspace that is sort of the cross thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.950
<v Speaker 0>We've heard that before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100]}

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:44.340
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, D and E, I understand where you're coming from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 0>And I think in this case, you might be confused

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 0>by my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 0>You might have been a little bit confused by my

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 0>bad picture there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100]}

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, that's sort of how does something like that that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,68,100,100,67,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 0>misleading actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 0>So it's really it's not just anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 0>So remember that if I've got something, if I've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 0>something in my subspace, then if I scale that, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 0>also got to be in the subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.540
<v Speaker 0>So it can't be anything that is sort of that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.460
<v Speaker 0>that is sort of has a limit to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 0>It has to go in all directions up to infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 0>And if you do that, you will get the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 0>of R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, the thing that I had there, the other two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 0>possibilities there, um, so particular number D that what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,95]}

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.370
<v Speaker 0>called the convex hull of these vectors, let us also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 0>consider that will in various causes is important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, but we're not getting that through through the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 0>So this is not the span indeed is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.150
<v Speaker 0>be the whole of are two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,87]}

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 0>How do I see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 0>So can I just um I just want to quickly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 0>show that here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:07.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um, the claim here that I have, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 0>the claim is that, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 0>Where do we go?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, that the span, um, of one one and one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 0>minus one here, um, is indeed the whole are two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,98,75,85]}

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, so how do I show that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, I show inclusions in both directions, so I hope

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,99,100,100,94,87,100]}

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.300
<v Speaker 0>you believe me that if I say that the span

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 0>of these things here, there's got to be a subset

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 0>of R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80]}

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 0>Can't really go out of R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 0>So I need to show I need to show that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 0>R2 is a subset of the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,62,49]}

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.590
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.640
<v Speaker 0>How do I do that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, I do that by taking any vector in R2

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 0>and show that that is also part of the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 0>So I can show that by saying I can take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 0>any vector x and y in R2, um, and show

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 0>that this is um, part of the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what does it mean that it's part of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 0>the span?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, it needs a need to be able to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 0>x and Y as the linear combination of the vectors

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.450
<v Speaker 0>in the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.410
<v Speaker 0>That was the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 0>So I need to be able to write this as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 0>one one plus s one minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,97,100,100]}

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh, now there's various ways around that and the sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,99,100,52,100,100]}

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.650
<v Speaker 0>of sake of time, because I still need to cover

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 0>one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.300
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.270
<v Speaker 0>But you could, for example, realise that what you've just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.870
<v Speaker 0>written down here is a linear system of equations with

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.690
<v Speaker 0>So I can now check whether I know whether this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.150
<v Speaker 0>is got a solution and it does have a solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.910
<v Speaker 0>Always think about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.820
<v Speaker 0>As I say, I'm not going to do that at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.310
<v Speaker 0>the moment in the interest of time.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, just one other thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.010
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if I had this here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.760
<v Speaker 0>So not half 111 minus one, but I've got one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:16.160
<v Speaker 0>two, one, three here as my elements there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.930
<v Speaker 0>So there's no these look much closer together here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.220
<v Speaker 0>Uh, 13123.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,85]}

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:33.500
<v Speaker 3>So this one here and that one there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.010
<v Speaker 0>What is this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.610
<v Speaker 0>What's the span here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100]}

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:47.540
<v Speaker 0>Anyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.130
<v Speaker 1>It's still the.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.400
<v Speaker 0>Hole.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.680
<v Speaker 0>It's still the hole of R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,67]}

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:52.130
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.650
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't really matter whether they're very close together.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.660
<v Speaker 0>So if they were parallel, it wouldn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.240
<v Speaker 0>But as long as they've got enough information, it'll span

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.920
<v Speaker 0>the whole of R2.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:08.240
<v Speaker 0>right.

<v Speaker 0>Notate or um, language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,100,99,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Um, so this banning it might be a bit confusing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,52,37,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.260
<v Speaker 0>So we say that if you've got the set X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.820
<v Speaker 0>here that that spans the subspace, you uh, we say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.550
<v Speaker 0>also that X is a spanning set for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.850
<v Speaker 0>And you on the other hand the span of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.240
<v Speaker 0>Now a little bit sort of a not not really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,83,98,100,100]}

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:29.780
<v Speaker 0>exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.490
<v Speaker 0>But you can think of X as a sort of

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:35.810

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.780
<v Speaker 0>And now it quite like to know a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.590
<v Speaker 0>We'd quite like to know a little bit about sort

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.910

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so I would like you to look at

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.120
<v Speaker 0>the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.350
<v Speaker 0>The following example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.060
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a poll there in a second.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.620
<v Speaker 0>Assuming that we've got three vectors u, v and x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.530
<v Speaker 0>x, u and v are three vectors that are half

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.330
<v Speaker 0>and are now going to look at the span of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.830
<v Speaker 0>two of them, x and u, and are also going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.920
<v Speaker 0>to have a look at the span of x and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.360
<v Speaker 0>u and v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.230
<v Speaker 0>So nothing more said about these vectors, just that I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.310
<v Speaker 0>got three vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.440
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to look at the span of two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 0>of them, the span of three of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 0>Now the question is what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 0>What do we know anything about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 0>And in particular, I'd like to think and this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 0>the this is the poll that a half, I suppose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,100,78,95,100,100]}

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we could have it in such a way that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 0>actually the span of those is the same span of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.280
<v Speaker 0>X and years, the span of x, U and V,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 0>so V doesn't add any more information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 0>So the question to you is a could that be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 0>could that be the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 0>So you might think that this is not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100,100]}

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 0>So answer E the situation is not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.910
<v Speaker 0>Or if it is possible what do I know about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 0>u and v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 0>What must how it must it be that the new

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 0>vector v is actually one that I have there already,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100]}

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 0>or multiple, or just the linear combination or something completely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 0>different?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 0>Five choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I've given you set this up to be in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 0>a minute and a half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we might just about half a minute and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 0>half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:48.640
<v Speaker 3>All.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43]}

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay, a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.280
<v Speaker 0>Few more seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.270
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.300
<v Speaker 0>So most of you say then it has to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 0>linear combination, not any of the others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, that is the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, and since it's relatively clear in the interest of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.320
<v Speaker 0>time, I'm not going to spend much more about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.170
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to sort of summarise the situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we're wanting to know the, the sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,97,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.140
<v Speaker 0>the relation between a set of space and its like

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.640
<v Speaker 0>and its generating set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,96,100,100]}

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:42.720
<v Speaker 0>What, its span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,46]}

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 0>So the vectors that span it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:48.270
<v Speaker 0>And we seen that we've seen already that a space

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.520
<v Speaker 0>like can have different spanning sets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.460
<v Speaker 0>I had two possible ones for two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,58,100,100,100,83,88]}

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, we now see that it might be possible to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.610
<v Speaker 0>actually include a third element that we still have the

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.910
<v Speaker 0>same spanning set, like the same set that is spanned.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.730
<v Speaker 0>So we don't even know, um, it doesn't even have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.050
<v Speaker 0>the same number of vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.350
<v Speaker 0>So that situation is a little bit unsatisfactory.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.720
<v Speaker 0>You know, that we don't really we'd like to have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.970
<v Speaker 0>something a bit more that we say, this is if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.010
<v Speaker 0>this is a generating set, we'd like to be able

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.780
<v Speaker 0>to say a little bit more about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, and indeed, um, that, that, that what we've just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.820
<v Speaker 0>had on the pole seems to suggest that some elements

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Speaker 0>of the spanning set can be superfluous, can be redundant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.490
<v Speaker 0>Question is, can we identify them?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,71,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, and that's pretty much where we're going to start

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.920
<v Speaker 0>off tomorrow and taking this further.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:38.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.
