<v Speaker 0>Hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.610

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.500

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 0>So I could write a solution to this point is

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.930

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.090

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.690

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 0>So there's my point there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.590

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.490

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 0>Look, if I line this up now, can I line

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.340

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 0>my head around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.940
<v Speaker 0>The reason being, let's go back to a me crab

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,51,100,99]}

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.310
<v Speaker 0>crawling along the stage.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.950
<v Speaker 0>If I am a point, how many directions can I

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:18.520
<v Speaker 0>move in?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:20.440
<v Speaker 0>None.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, there were no free parameters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 0>I'm stuck here and I can't move, which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.340
<v Speaker 0>bit annoying if I've got to spend the rest of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.120
<v Speaker 0>the lecture here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.590
<v Speaker 0>And so I'm going to become a line again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:35.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yes, zero dimensions if you've got no directions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:35.800
<v Speaker 0>to move in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,49]}

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 0>So free parameters are actually three variables or parameters, depending

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 0>on how you want to call them, are quite important

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 0>because they tell you how how dimensional your spaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if we have a system of equations, we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.220
<v Speaker 0>seen that if we only had a linear equation provided

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 0>it was consistent, we got a one dimensional space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 0>So if we adding equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 0>Can not always but it can reduce the dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 0>Of the space we're working in of the space of

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 0>solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.900
<v Speaker 0>By well one adding I suppose I should say adding

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.450
<v Speaker 0>an equation reduces it by one can reduce it by

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:33.660
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 0>Not always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.700
<v Speaker 0>Here we added another equation And it didn't.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.330
<v Speaker 0>So it is not always true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.190

<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.600
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.700
<v Speaker 0>Let us, uh, return to to our first GeoGebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.470
<v Speaker 0>There we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.380
<v Speaker 0>Oh, everything's disappeared again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Please reload sensibly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.430
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.070
<v Speaker 0>So that was our plane of solutions that we had.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.490
<v Speaker 0>Let me now add a second plane and I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.150
<v Speaker 0>to add.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.530
<v Speaker 0>What am I going to add?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:31.190
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to add the plane two x minus y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:34.730
<v Speaker 0>minus z equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.380
<v Speaker 0>So we just to note before we had x plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.260
<v Speaker 0>two y minus z equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 0>And now we're adding this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 0>No we didn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 0>This is the one we had before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 0>This is the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 0>And now we're going to add this second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100]}

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 0>So we've now got a system of two linear equations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 0>and three unknowns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 0>So if I add to this equation what are we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 0>going to be x plus two y minus z equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:08.890
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 0>And let's just change the colour of that so it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 0>easier to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 0>Uh there we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 0>So we have two planes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, what dimension are we expecting?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 0>The space of solutions to be one dimension, a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.930
<v Speaker 0>In fact, we can see it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,50]}

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 0>Line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.150
<v Speaker 0>It's where these two planes cross, Which is what we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:35.960
<v Speaker 0>expecting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, and actually we can see this in terms of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.500
<v Speaker 0>the parameter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.520
<v Speaker 0>So remember, if we remember before we had x equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.620
<v Speaker 0>s, y equals r and we then had z equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.420
<v Speaker 0>to s minus r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.580
<v Speaker 0>If we add these to our second equation uh we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.660
<v Speaker 0>then going to have well s plus two lots of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Speaker 0>ys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.330
<v Speaker 0>So two r minus z.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,100]}

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.440
<v Speaker 0>So minus two s minus r equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.730
<v Speaker 0>Can simplify that up I'm going to get three r

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.190
<v Speaker 0>minus s I do believe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Minus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.490
<v Speaker 0>Minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 0>What minus minus is a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,98,90]}

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.160
<v Speaker 0>So I get two uh minus minus r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.950
<v Speaker 0>So three r and s minus two s is minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.400
<v Speaker 0>s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.870
<v Speaker 0>Am I wrong?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:30.740
<v Speaker 0>I might be wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:33.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Speaker 0>It's really weird standing up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 0>Suddenly you lose the ability to do somewhat maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that now means s equals to the R,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,98]}

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 0>So that means the space of solutions before we had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 0>them as SR2S minus r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100]}

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 0>But this extra equation lets us write one of those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 0>parameters in terms of the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.670
<v Speaker 0>So now I can get the equation of my line

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 0>as well S is three r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.850
<v Speaker 0>So this can be three r or 3 or 4

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,58,100,100,100,93,69,69,69]}

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 0>times two is six r minus r is five r.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 0>So there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 0>I now have a space with one parameter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 0>So what dimension am I one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.010
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I can move in a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 0>That is all good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.880
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.620
<v Speaker 0>Everybody happy so far then?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 0>So we'll talk about this a bit more tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:37.680
<v Speaker 0>But the rank of um, the system of the augmented

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.140
<v Speaker 0>matrix associated to the system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.610
<v Speaker 0>One thing it's kind of doing is counting the I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.470
<v Speaker 0>going to write here meaningful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.240
<v Speaker 0>Equations in your system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.470
<v Speaker 0>So if you've got two, um, two lines that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.330
<v Speaker 0>the same, the rank is not going to count it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.020
<v Speaker 0>twice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.770
<v Speaker 0>It's only counting the ones that actually contribute to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 0>solution is one way of kind of thinking about rank

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.880
<v Speaker 0>that can be quite helpful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.410
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.210
<v Speaker 0>Everyone happy so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,99]}

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 0>Any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.780
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have a question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100]}

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:15.690
<v Speaker 1>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.680
<v Speaker 0>So in the reading this then led to theorem 1.2.2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.250
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully we saw this in the reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, if a system of m equations in n variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.660
<v Speaker 0>So it makes it quite clear how many variables you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 0>working in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 0>So even if all your equations look like they're only

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 0>in two variables again, health warning check how many you

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 0>were actually working in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 0>Are you in three dimensions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.520
<v Speaker 0>Four dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 0>Five dimensions okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 0>We want these to be consistent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 0>What does consistent mean has a solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 0>So inconsistent means we have no solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 0>Consistent means has solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 0>At least one solution okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to say the rank is are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,93,100]}

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 0>So we're counting the number of meaningful equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 0>Then as a generalisation of that statement I wrote up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.270

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 0>somewhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, this first point is exactly what I wrote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.510
<v Speaker 0>If we've only got one equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.590
<v Speaker 0>The set of solutions line in n minus r dimensional

<v Speaker 0>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 0>So in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79]}

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.490
<v Speaker 0>Actually if you in the reading it says has n

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.899

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:44.560
<v Speaker 0>But I think we've established number of parameters equals dimension.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.659

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:52.240
<v Speaker 0>Um and this is the big, big theorem that one

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.340

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.750
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and the first part's the kind of important part,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.060

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.940
<v Speaker 0>Why, if n equals r, why is there a unique

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.750
<v Speaker 0>solution?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Because all three variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,76,100]}

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah n minus r equal to zero.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.730
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.830
<v Speaker 0>So there were no free variables I'm a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:17.650
<v Speaker 0>My point is a unique solution if I'm anything other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.070
<v Speaker 0>And provided I exist, if I'm on a line, how

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.420

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.250
<v Speaker 0>Infinitely many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.110
<v Speaker 0>If I'm on a plane, there are infinitely many.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.720
<v Speaker 0>If I'm in a 264 dimensional hyperplane.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.710
<v Speaker 0>There are definitely infinitely many solutions, so the only time

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.110
<v Speaker 0>there is a unique solution is when the number of

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 0>all of your equations equal the number of variables, and

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.380
<v Speaker 0>all of them are contributing to that answer.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 0>So next question, we are moving on to a slightly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 0>different bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 0>Now that's the end of that bit.

<v Speaker 0>Um, you may be pleased to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 0>So another question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.320
<v Speaker 0>This one I'm going to give you a bit longer

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 0>for now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 0>What are you seeing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, if there is a system of equations, three equations

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 0>in three unknowns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm only in three dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, and my question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:33.920
<v Speaker 0>Firstly turn to your neighbour and find the augmented matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.660
<v Speaker 0>What is the augmented matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.720
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to give you four options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.580
<v Speaker 0>One of which one of these does not come from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.270
<v Speaker 0>a raw operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,41,100]}

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.800
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to give you a while for this because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.540
<v Speaker 0>this is a bit convoluted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.380
<v Speaker 0>Let us first find the augmented matrix and then we'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.090
<v Speaker 0>we'll do some more operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,94,100]}

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.380
<v Speaker 0>So if you will write your augmented matrix down actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.760
<v Speaker 0>on, um.

<v Speaker 0>Um, so in the first one, what did we do?

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:49.690

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.540

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.620

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.500

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.930
<v Speaker 1>That's.

<v Speaker 0>Not right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.850
<v Speaker 0>We tend to write arrows instead, and we like to

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.850

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.460
<v Speaker 0>So for everyone sake, let's write it out quite clearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.380
<v Speaker 0>And we do it in this really weird way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.410
<v Speaker 0>We, um, you cannot see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.370
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.010
<v Speaker 0>I will learn one day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.490
<v Speaker 0>So in this first one, we took row two, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:04.320
<v Speaker 0>we're saying the new row two is equivalent to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.550
<v Speaker 0>old row two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:09.210
<v Speaker 0>I've written this is half of the old row two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,77,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 0>So we do this really weird thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.060
<v Speaker 0>If we kind of say row two is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.250
<v Speaker 0>half of row two, but one's the new row two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.510
<v Speaker 0>and one's the old row two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.720
<v Speaker 0>And then that gives us I'm not going to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61]}

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.120
<v Speaker 0>it out, but the matrix in one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 0>What do we do for the second one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, we swapped one and three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.250
<v Speaker 0>So this one's a nicer way of writing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.510
<v Speaker 0>We just write kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100]}

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.360
<v Speaker 0>We swapped row one and three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.220
<v Speaker 0>We just do an arrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.660
<v Speaker 0>There's no new old stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.700
<v Speaker 0>What do we do for row three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:45.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh, vector matrix three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,98,100,100]}

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.250
<v Speaker 0>It's not vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:49.250
<v Speaker 0>Art.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:49.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 0>Row one and three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.170
<v Speaker 0>So here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.610
<v Speaker 0>Row three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:53.600
<v Speaker 0>That's two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.040
<v Speaker 0>Row three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.770
<v Speaker 0>The new row three became row three plus row one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.640
<v Speaker 0>You don't need to write old and new above them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.210
<v Speaker 0>each time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.540
<v Speaker 0>I'm doing it to make it clear, but, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:10.250
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.790
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone actually work out how I got to vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:14.000
<v Speaker 0>four?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 0>I did, actually, that is sensible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.620
<v Speaker 0>I didn't just pick numbers out of thin air.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,98,98]}

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:22.720
<v Speaker 0>Any ideas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Yet?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.140
<v Speaker 4>You multiply the coefficients of the above.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,22,79,41]}

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.450
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.100
<v Speaker 0>I have no idea how you'd write that down, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.720
<v Speaker 0>it's weird, but I essentially timed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:36.430
<v Speaker 0>I made new row three old, rowed three times, row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,27,100,100,100]}

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.890
<v Speaker 0>two times in some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86]}

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's nonsense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.230
<v Speaker 0>That is not an elementary row operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:49.330
<v Speaker 0>Please do not try times in rows together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,67,100,100]}

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.450
<v Speaker 0>You can times them by a scalar like we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.230
<v Speaker 0>at the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.950
<v Speaker 0>But those are the three options we can swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.000
<v Speaker 0>We can scale a multiply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:10.540
<v Speaker 0>And we can add those are three valid row operations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.460
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.550
<v Speaker 0>Are we all happy there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have any questions or thoughts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.420
<v Speaker 0>Feelings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:20.650
<v Speaker 0>Combine them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,64]}

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, you can combine them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 0>Try not to combine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't combine swap with the other two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.990
<v Speaker 0>But you could do a linear combination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 0>So you could say all three plus one half of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,93,100]}

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 0>row two for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 1>Um.
