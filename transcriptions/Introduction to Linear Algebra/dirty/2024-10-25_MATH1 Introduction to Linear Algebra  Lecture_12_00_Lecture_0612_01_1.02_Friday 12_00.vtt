00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.840

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.890

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.570

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, we're also saying d should an equal zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.580

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 0>p which is definitely not a line.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 0>That's just a point x is just a pointer.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 0>So we can't this equation is essentially saying here's a

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 0>point to get onto your line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100]}

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.420

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 0>But if you can't move along your line T steps,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 0>then you've not got an equation of your line.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.960
<v Speaker 0>So you better have that d not equal to zero.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.970

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.640
<v Speaker 0>If A is zero then yes, they are technically scalar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.750
<v Speaker 0>multiples of each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.260
<v Speaker 0>Um a minus t equals zero goes to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes you zero and a is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Then this statement is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So B is not equal to zero is not always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.680
<v Speaker 0>So we say that again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>B and a are zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.560
<v Unknown>And x equal to zero goes to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,97,67,64,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Unknown>For the equal to zero is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 0>Uh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 0>But if both D and in this case I seem

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 0>to have changed my notation r zero, then you've essentially

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,99,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 0>got the equation x equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 0>That's not a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.870
<v Speaker 0>That's a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 0>We still want it to be the equation of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 0>line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.300
<v Speaker 0>So x is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 1>That means it's a line because it doesn't matter what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,29,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.610
<v Speaker 0>Uh so okay so safety equals zero and p equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.300
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 0>Then this whole equation is just x equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 0>That's not the equation of a line because that's just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 0>the equation of a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.560
<v Speaker 0>We're just what is that vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.800
<v Speaker 0>It's got zero sides and no direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's two dimensional.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100]}

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>And d can be anything like except an axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,43,100,100,100,68,95,81,83]}

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 0>So so x is the kind of unknown bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 0>So okay so let's think of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,48]}

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Let's deconstruct this equation of the line a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Speaker 0>This is essentially I've got my line and I've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 0>somewhere my origin over here in this particular case, my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 0>origins on my line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.690
<v Speaker 0>But more generally we've got a line in an origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.320
<v Speaker 0>Equations of this form have some vector d that go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 0>along the equation of the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 0>So giving us a direction to go along that line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.340
<v Speaker 0>And then this point p is just some point on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.970
<v Speaker 0>our line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 0>So this is a kind of directional vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 0>And p we're actually taking to be a positional vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.250
<v Speaker 0>So from the origin it's giving us a point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 0>go to on our line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.450
<v Speaker 0>So then what this is saying is the point x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 0>The general point x on my line is I go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 0>up p, I go from the origin to P, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 0>I go along d by some scalar multiple of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 0>So I take ds t steps along d and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,35,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 0>I get to the point x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that's the kind of addition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,75]}

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 0>I think the last.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Confusion is because X represents a vector, not an.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.660
<v Speaker 0>X coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:53.830
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.070
<v Speaker 0>So that's this is the vector, you know, x1 all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.010
<v Speaker 0>the way up to x n for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, it is a general point on our line that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.660
<v Speaker 0>we're trying to find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.170
<v Speaker 0>It's not a fixed point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,95]}

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.500
<v Speaker 0>So so D and P are fixed vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.670
<v Speaker 0>We have the vector x is just the vector of

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.350
<v Speaker 0>the point on the line we're trying to find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,93,93,100,100]}

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.280
<v Speaker 0>Does that make sense to people a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.670
<v Speaker 0>So if D is zero then we can't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.410
<v Speaker 0>We don't have a direction for a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.690
<v Speaker 0>We don't know which way our line's pointing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100]}

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.530
<v Speaker 0>So we probably almost certainly definitely don't want D to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.130
<v Speaker 0>be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.950
<v Speaker 0>Any questions or are we happy with that.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.160
<v Speaker 0>We're good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.010
<v Speaker 0>So what kind of conditions do we want on a

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 0>do we want?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.520
<v Speaker 0>So in our case, the origin is actually on the

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 0>line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.170
<v Speaker 0>So we could take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.900
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean a has to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.490

<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we know it could be zero.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.960

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.360
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't have to be the point zero just because

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.710
<v Speaker 0>zero is on our line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.930
<v Speaker 0>Does that mean that's the only point we can choose

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.370
<v Speaker 0>when writing this equation?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 0>We could choose any point P, we could choose.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.080
<v Speaker 0>You know, let's actually draw the line L through our

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 0>That's still going to be our starting point.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.800

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.270
<v Speaker 0>So it just it doesn't have to be zero, but

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.550
<v Speaker 0>it does have to be a vector that to get

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.570
<v Speaker 0>and B, in order to be able to walk along

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 0>my plane so I can walk one way, I can

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.980

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 0>But I need just a point to start on my

<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.320
<v Speaker 0>This is the point where you plonk me down and

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.320
<v Speaker 0>yeah, I've got somewhere to begin and then I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.610
<v Speaker 0>walk anywhere I want to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so it's the same principle as the line you

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.910
<v Speaker 0>plonk me down somewhere and then I can walk along.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.150
<v Speaker 0>Except this time I can walk along in two directions.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.960

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is the parametric form, uh, which we've

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.200
<v Speaker 0>seen before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.040

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.900
<v Speaker 0>So if we think about this equation of the plane,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.290

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.300
<v Speaker 0>in the plane, they're all points in the plane, P

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.370
<v Speaker 0>is a point on the plane, and A is a

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.860

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 0>vector that lies in the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 0>Because if not, I wouldn't be staying in the plane

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.830
<v Speaker 0>So everything there is in the plane, and that's generally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 0>very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.020
<v Speaker 0>If you're looking at the plane, it's useful to see

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.710
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes it's useful to see what's not in the plane

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.000

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, particularly in three dimensions, if I'm in three dimensions

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.640

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 0>do I have?

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.180
<v Speaker 0>One.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:44.810
<v Speaker 0>There is one unique line that is perpendicular to my

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.540
<v Speaker 0>That's definitely not in my plane.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 0>So in my walking on the stage example, that's up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 0>If I jump, I'm not in my plane.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, and sometimes it's useful to know what that third

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 0>And then you can kind of take the plane to

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.290

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.840

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.040

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.200
<v Speaker 0>So again, it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83]}

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.770
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to the fun world of vectors, where we use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.800
<v Speaker 0>the word vector to describe many, many different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the question said where A and B are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.080
<v Speaker 0>two points on the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.450
<v Speaker 0>So when we're taking them as points on the plane,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.970
<v Speaker 0>we're taking them as position vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.520
<v Speaker 0>So it's not like A and B, it's not like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.960
<v Speaker 0>a and B from the previous one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.140
<v Speaker 0>Notation and maths is not consistent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.620
<v Speaker 0>Basically there are only 26 Latin letters capitalised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,99,100,99]}

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.900
<v Speaker 0>Still some Greeks still a bit of Arabic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.670
<v Speaker 0>You still don't have enough letters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, so they are different from the A and B?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:04.350
<v Speaker 0>We just had any other questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.130
<v Speaker 0>So that's a good yeah a good point that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.510
<v Speaker 0>dot product with the points A and B aren't um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.960
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.290
<v Speaker 0>But we do have if you rearrange this we do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.500
<v Speaker 0>have x dot Start n equals p dot n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,89,100,97,73,100]}

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Speaker 0>So that must be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:27.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.630
<v Speaker 0>So that um, is planes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90]}

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:38.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, let us move on to talking about projections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.030
<v Speaker 0>Which is another thing that's very important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.760
<v Speaker 0>So let's start with just a projection on a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.020
<v Speaker 0>So there's my line L.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 0>It's a vector equation of a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.710
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to have some D that goes along

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.190
<v Speaker 0>the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.560
<v Speaker 0>And let's have some p that's on my line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.710
<v Speaker 0>And that's going to define parametrically the equation of my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 0>line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay I'm then going to have some vector u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.340
<v Speaker 0>And at some point you I'm going to put the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 0>tail of u on the line L because I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.300
<v Speaker 0>do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.350
<v Speaker 0>U is some vector that I'm going to put the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.390
<v Speaker 0>tail on the line u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88]}

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.890
<v Speaker 0>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.440
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to project you down to L.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.880
<v Speaker 0>You've done this a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.430
<v Speaker 0>You've been projecting secretly ever since you started doing coordinate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.390
<v Speaker 0>geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.810
<v Speaker 0>So, um, when you, when you do things like, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 0>know, we consider x, y as, uh, x times one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.640
<v Speaker 0>vector and y times those vectors, that is just projection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:57.240
<v Speaker 0>We're taking a vector and we're projecting down to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.060
<v Speaker 0>x coordinate and we're projecting down to the y coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.090
<v Speaker 0>So we're doing exactly the same thing you've been doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.520
<v Speaker 0>ever since you started writing coordinates down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.730
<v Speaker 0>We're just doing it for General Line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, so again we want to project down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:19.890
<v Speaker 0>We want to find this Vector, which I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.850
<v Speaker 0>call u1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.330
<v Speaker 0>So U1 is lying on my line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:31.170
<v Speaker 0>It's along the direction of my line and it forms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.180
<v Speaker 0>a little right angled triangle with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.130
<v Speaker 0>What's this dotted vector?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100]}

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.010
<v Speaker 0>What's thinking about what we did yesterday?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,38,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.100
<v Speaker 0>How can I write this line in terms of U1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.580
<v Speaker 0>and U.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:42.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:45.690
<v Speaker 0>Pardon?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.180
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I'm just thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.280
<v Speaker 0>I don't think you're wrong, but I'm just thinking in

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.840
<v Speaker 0>terms of addition and subtraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 0>It's u minus u1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.370
<v Speaker 0>So that's what that vector is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100]}

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:04.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.500
<v Speaker 0>And some people make all this U2 because it's the

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.860
<v Speaker 0>second coordinate of U with respect to the normal of

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.520
<v Speaker 0>this line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:12.510
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.670
<v Speaker 0>So we then want to project down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.630
<v Speaker 0>What do we how does U1 relate to the vectors?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, on about the line L, what do what do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Speaker 0>we know about U1 and the vectors DNP?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah they're parallel and yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,58,100]}

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:32.700
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.390
<v Speaker 0>They're multiple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100]}

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.320
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 0>So this is some multiple of D uh because D

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.870
<v Speaker 0>is the direction of my line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.340
<v Speaker 0>This is pointing in the same direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.080
<v Speaker 0>So it's some scalar multiple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.270
<v Speaker 0>It's a different size but it's got the same direction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.220
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.770
<v Speaker 0>So we know we hit this vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.020
<v Speaker 0>And this vector have to be perpendicular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.910
<v Speaker 0>And we know this one is just a um scalar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.230
<v Speaker 0>multiple of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.420
<v Speaker 0>So what's nice operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100]}

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.950
<v Speaker 0>We know if we've got perpendicular lines dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.370
<v Speaker 0>Brilliant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.030
<v Speaker 0>So um we can put this all together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:14.130
<v Speaker 0>We know that U1 well actually we know You two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,92]}

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.760
<v Speaker 0>dotted with D has to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.920
<v Speaker 0>We know this is perpendicular to the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 0>We can write this as u minus t times d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,90]}

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.850
<v Speaker 0>Instead of writing u1, let's write in terms of d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,75,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.480
<v Speaker 0>Equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.600
<v Speaker 0>And then if you do a load of rearranging the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.470
<v Speaker 0>book does this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.660
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not going to go too much detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.080
<v Speaker 0>But if you rearrange this you can find that t

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 0>is a number that's equal to u d divided by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 0>the size of d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 0>And that is how we define the projection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to say the projection of u onto

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 0>the line L which is defined by we're going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 0>Well yeah we can define it by L.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes people might write here D because D's defining the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,71,86,100]}

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 0>direction of this line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 0>And actually if you think about this projection the position

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 0>of this line doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100]}

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 0>It's Parallel lines, so we more care about the direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,45,93,100,100,100]}

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 0>Then we do the exact point it goes through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, so some people might write this as the projection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 0>onto the vector d of u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 0>But all of this is going to be is it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 0>going to be ug over d squared times d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51,100,78,100,100,91]}

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 0>So that is how we project.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 0>And we can do this iteratively.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.260
<v Speaker 0>That's how to project onto one line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 0>If I then had another line I could take you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 0>to and I could project onto another line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.250
<v Speaker 0>So I could find the X coordinate project onto the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 0>x axis, for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 0>And then my U2 is going to be something lying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 0>in the y and z coordinate, the y z plane,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 0>and then I could project that vector into the y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 0>coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 0>And what I'm going to get left with is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.030
<v Speaker 0>z coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 0>So I can do this iteratively.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.250
<v Speaker 0>I can build it up, um, all the way onto

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 0>projecting onto a plane for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 0>So actually let's do an example together of projecting, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 0>onto a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.880
<v Speaker 0>I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100]}

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we have let's think about our plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 0>We're going to give it a normal vector n, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 0>we're going to have two vectors u and v lying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 0>in my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 0>All happy so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we're then going to have some vector u.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to try and define it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to do this example with actual numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 0>So uh there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to have the vector U which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 0>going to be 213.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to have the vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 0>We're going to have our plane defined by uh this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 0>equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:10.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.470
<v Speaker 0>So that's the equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.440
<v Speaker 0>My plane it's not got a constant term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 0>So where actually what point has to lie on this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.460
<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.170
<v Speaker 0>The origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:20.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.870
<v Speaker 0>Because you can take turns to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:23.350
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.570
<v Speaker 0>So we know that the origin is somewhere on this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:25.960
<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.680
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.340
<v Speaker 0>That's the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100]}

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.830
<v Speaker 0>So let's project you down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:36.190
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to call this plane Pi because that's you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.430
<v Speaker 0>normally call a plane capital P or capital Pi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we'll go for pi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 0>There's some P's later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,100]}

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.550
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we have two options.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 0>We could project onto the normal and take that away

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 0>to find you one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100]}

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 0>That's the other thing we could do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 0>So in our line example, we could project onto the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 0>normal line to find U2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 0>And then via subtraction we'd get U1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 0>And with a plane that can sometimes be more helpful

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 0>because there's only one normal, whereas there are two vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 0>in my play.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51]}

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 0>So you're kind of huffing the work in some ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 0>But this is where how you write the plane becomes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 0>important, because if you don't have the normal, then that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 0>work to do beforehand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 0>So we're not going to just project onto the normal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 0>and take away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,94]}

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 0>We're going to just project onto these two vectors, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.820
<v Speaker 0>straight away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 0>So we are going to have the projection onto my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 0>plane pie.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,45]}

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 0>We will go to any questions okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,89,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, of the vector you and we're going to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,52,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 0>this, but um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 0>Let's call these two what should I call these two

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to first project onto D1 and then

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:27.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, so projection is helpful because this perpendicular distance is

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.040

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.230
<v Speaker 0>is finding the shortest distance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 0>Um but let us move on because we still have

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.690
<v Speaker 0>to do the cross-product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91]}

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.520

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:47.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 0>Last topic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, so everything I've said so far today and yesterday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 0>works for any vector or you can generalise it to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.690
<v Speaker 0>any size vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, you need to be slightly careful about some details,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.970
<v Speaker 0>but generally the basic theory works for how big your

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:08.840
<v Speaker 0>vector is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.880
<v Speaker 0>The cross-product only works in our three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.630
<v Speaker 0>This is only in R3, so that's something to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.320
<v Speaker 0>very careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.170
<v Speaker 0>There's also a version in seven dimensions actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.610
<v Speaker 0>But let's not mention that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, but otherwise there is absolutely no generalisation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.390
<v Speaker 0>It holds in three and seven and nowhere else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:35.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so all three vectors, um, that is the definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.000
<v Speaker 0>of the cross-product you cannot see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,46,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Ta da!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,97]}

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.740
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.740
<v Speaker 0>That is how you calculate the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, please make sure you can calculate the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,97]}

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.740
<v Speaker 0>It is one of those types of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.100
<v Speaker 0>So we've now got two types of vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.420
<v Speaker 0>The cross product is important and it is surprisingly important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.080
<v Speaker 0>It turns up in surprisingly wide areas of maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.440
<v Speaker 0>So it's useful to have some practice to just doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,93,100,100]}

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 0>some cross products and making sure you can do it

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.780
<v Speaker 0>reasonably confidently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, uh, so yeah, always a good thing to be

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.760
<v Speaker 0>able to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.580
<v Speaker 0>However, that is the definition that is really not very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.040

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.700
<v Speaker 0>going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.260
<v Speaker 0>So let us think about what's going on a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.550
<v Speaker 0>more geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the cross product, if I've got two vectors

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.030
<v Speaker 0>u and v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:48.020
<v Speaker 0>The cross product finds me the vector perpendicular to both

<v Speaker 0>of the normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.340
<v Speaker 0>It all actually follows a right hand rule, so you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61,61,100,100]}

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.610
<v Speaker 0>can work out which way the cross product should point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,93,100,100]}

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:09.050
<v Speaker 0>You stick your forefinger in your middle finger as u

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.410
<v Speaker 0>and v, and your thumb points in the direction of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.250
<v Speaker 0>the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's telling us the direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.090
<v Speaker 0>What else do we need for vector though?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 0>Magnitude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.410
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.260
<v Speaker 0>So the magnitude is actually the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 0>Of the parallelogram spanned by u and v.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.060
<v Speaker 0>So if you got u as one edge and v

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.350
<v Speaker 0>is the other edge, that parallelogram in the middle, the

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:44.600
<v Speaker 0>area of this equals the size of the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.820
<v Speaker 0>So let us think about what this looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.210
<v Speaker 0>What's a big screen?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,81,100,100]}

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.900
<v Speaker 0>This big screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100]}

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so here's my two vectors u and v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.590
<v Speaker 0>And if I as I change v then that's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.280
<v Speaker 0>what I meant to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, as I change v and make it closer to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.800
<v Speaker 0>you, that area of my parallelogram gets smaller and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.320
<v Speaker 0>too does my cross-product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,52]}

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 0>Whereas if I make my parallelogram really big, my my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.450
<v Speaker 0>cross product gets really big.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90,100,100,100]}

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.620
<v Speaker 0>And actually I can then use my right hand rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 0>I can flip it if I keep going around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.730
<v Speaker 0>And this works not just in the x coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.820
<v Speaker 0>If I move this up, I tilt it and I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.940
<v Speaker 0>going to tilt my perpendicular line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 0>And then I can shift things around again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 0>So we've.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61]}

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 0>does that make sense?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have any questions on on that aspect of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 0>the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,85]}

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.680
<v Speaker 0>So then let's think about a kind of more natural

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.390
<v Speaker 0>definition of the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, how could we find the area of this parallelogram

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 0>just going back to kind of school maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 0>How do we work out the area of a parallelogram?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 1>A5 yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100]}

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 0>Half based, um, based on site.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,70]}

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 0>Or actually, let's try thinking about it as two triangles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.550
<v Speaker 0>How do you work out the area of a general

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 0>triangle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 0>What if I call this angle theta?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.520
<v Speaker 0>But I've got two of these so we'll get rid

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 0>of the half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 0>So this area I could just say is well it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 0>the size of one length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 0>That's the norm of u times the norm of V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 0>And then the triangle is half that times sine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,89,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 0>So but we've got double that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 0>So are we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,31,100]}

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 0>Are you the time to sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,91,86,58,88,69]}

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 0>And then some people therefore define the cross product as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,83,100]}

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 0>this thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh, times the unit vector n where n is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 0>unit normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 0>Two u and v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 0>So that is a useful thing to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 0>So we now have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 0>So what happens when u and v are perpendicular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 0>Does anything fun happen there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Yeah this equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 0>So so r when when we're perpendicular we get the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 0>biggest possible value size of u times v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 0>So if I can kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 0>Uh, let's make these a bit smaller so we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 0>see, uh, if I oh, let's let's reset it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,98,100,100,100]}

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Speaker 0>And then it'd be easy to see in the flat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 0>So commonly that is perpendicular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100]}

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 0>This is as big as it gets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 0>If I move it this way it gets used you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,87,87]}

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.140
<v Speaker 0>times V is getting smaller.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,94,98,100,100]}

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 0>That's the biggest thing it can be if I move

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 0>it that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 0>It's also getting smaller.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 0>So it's maximal when they're at a right angle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,98,63,91,83,100]}

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 0>What about when they're not at a right angle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 0>What about when they're parallel zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:18.860
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 0>So let's think about well the area of my parallelogram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 0>So yes indeed it is.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:26.660
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:33.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this actually gives us quite a useful way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.840
<v Speaker 0>of checking when things are parallel perpendicular.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.260
<v Speaker 0>We have um the dot product is zero if they're

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.070

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.640

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.060
<v Speaker 0>So we've got a plane in normal form and the

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.830

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:21.750
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, N is perpendicular to A and B.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 0>That is very true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.790
<v Speaker 0>Yes, n is perpendicular to a and b, uh, a

<v Speaker 0>the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.610
<v Speaker 0>So those are perpendicular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.360
<v Speaker 0>That is very true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, the normal is perpendicular to both direction vectors.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:41.790
<v Speaker 0>The normal is.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:42.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.910
<v Speaker 0>That is all very true reasoning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.250
<v Speaker 0>I very much agree with all of you.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, sadly, you are all wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.350
<v Speaker 0>The vast majority of you are wrong.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:56.070
<v Speaker 0>Let's think about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:56.880
<v Speaker 0>So you are true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.230
<v Speaker 0>They are all perpendicular.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.910
<v Speaker 0>The direction is right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:04.920
<v Speaker 0>So A times B does lie in the direction of

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.170
<v Speaker 0>n, but ns any normal vector n is any vector

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.060
<v Speaker 0>that is perpendicular to the plane.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.030

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:19.320
<v Speaker 0>So what is true is they are parallel that a

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.220

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.400
<v Speaker 0>but that doesn't mean they are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.820
<v Speaker 0>They could be a different size, same direction diff wrong

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 0>size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 0>We all seem very convinced that a cross N cross

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.770
<v Speaker 0>A doesn't necessarily equal B, and vice versa.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is a case where that is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.680
<v Speaker 0>What extra condition would we need on A and B

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.670
<v Speaker 0>where that is true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.220
<v Speaker 2>For A and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.680
<v Speaker 0>B, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.680
<v Speaker 0>If A and B were perpendicular to each other and

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.920
<v Speaker 0>all the sizes worked out, then that could be true.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if you had, for example, three vectors that

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.880

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.690
<v Speaker 0>then that is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.640
<v Speaker 0>So it is true for the vector I, j and

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.780

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.620
