<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to week four of Introduction to Linear Algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'll leave the QR code for attendance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 0>Just a few more seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 0>If anyone hasn't managed to scan it already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 0>But as we will see, week four is a very

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 0>packed week and a very important one because we start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 0>talking about determinants and invertibility and which are all things,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 0>all topics that essentially will serve as the basis for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 0>the big thing that's coming up, which is matrix diagonalization,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalues, eigenvector and everything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100]}

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 0>So I hope everyone has managed to take the attendance

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 0>And let's start with a quick overview of what we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 0>are discussing this this week together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 0>So as you as you are familiar with now, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 0>week is divided in sort of two parts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 0>You have two readings and two lectures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 0>And so today we will look at the definition of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 0>determinants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 0>And we will look at cofactor expansion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 0>We will look at some basic property of determinants and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 0>determinants of spatial matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100]}

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 0>On the other hand is something wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 0>Whereas tomorrow we will focus more on um some other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 0>things, which is how to use determinants to check whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 0>or not a matrix is invertible and how to calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 0>explicitly the inverse using the aggregate matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 0>There's plenty of material about this, but in the reading,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,82,100,100]}

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 0>and I also created a few videos that sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 0>summarise all of these topics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 0>Yes, I see hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51]}

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,78,62]}

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 0>There's no question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 0>That's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 0>I'm not the manager of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 0>The core secretary is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100]}

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 0>So we will try again at the end of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 0>lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 0>But now I need to go to go on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Anything else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 0>So let's start straight with hopefully this book club would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,92,98]}

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 0>will work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, so just make sure you sign in for, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 0>for the time being.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, this should be the same code, by the way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.670
<v Speaker 0>It's just one is embedded in the in the slide,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 0>and the other one isn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we will start with some sort of, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.960
<v Speaker 0>very simple getting to know the tool a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 0>You should be seeing question one already, which should be,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 0>uh, filling the gap question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,96,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm going to give you a minute or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 0>two to make club work and to, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 0>Start thinking about what you're reading and submit the answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.360
<v Speaker 0>If anyone has any problem with this book club, please

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,60,100]}

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 0>tell me sooner rather than later because otherwise this one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.200
<v Speaker 0>not working would be a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 0>I do not have a timer for the bookclub question,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,100]}

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 0>but I will wrap them up myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so a lot of questions are in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 0>And, um, okay, let's go over them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 0>The question asks is the definition of the cofactor cij.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,73,100,100,100,100,99,98]}

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 0>I represents the row or column while j represents.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's going to be the other one obviously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 0>And really we could, we could choose, um, whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 0>We like to answer this question, but we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 0>stay consistent throughout the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 0>We can decide to have rows first and column seconds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 0>or column first row seconds, that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.780
<v Speaker 0>But because the entire mathematical community has sort of agreed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,97]}

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 0>that the first number refers to the row and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 0>second number refers to the column, then it's just a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.420
<v Speaker 0>useful to go with that, because then everything we read

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.690
<v Speaker 0>of the of the of the book, everything that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.110
<v Speaker 0>lecture prepare in the lecture notes, we'll use that convention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:23.040
<v Speaker 0>So in a matrix, in a matrix A and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100]}

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.980
<v Speaker 0>represent the row that we're looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 0>And J represents the column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100]}

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.970
<v Speaker 0>And that was the easy part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,63]}

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 0>The more difficult bit was the second one which um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 0>ask what are the dimension of the cofactor?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 0>And uh, I see that I have a great number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 0>of answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 0>I have n and minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 0>I am J all over the place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 0>What is the cofactor?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 0>How is the cofactor defined?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 0>The cofactor is something, but the crucial thing is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 0>part that the cofactor is a determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 0>It's the determinant of the uh a j a ij

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,76,99,99,98,64]}

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 0>matrix, which is the one that is stripped of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 0>ith column and the jth um and the jth row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 0>So the cofactor is a scalar number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 0>It has dimension one times one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 0>The reduced matrix will have dimensions m minus one and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 0>minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 0>That is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 0>But the cofactor is defined as its determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 0>And so for that reason um C I j of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,86,100,100,100]}

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 0>a will be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 0>In.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 0>Have you seen this notation here before?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 0>R to the power of one times one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 0>It's essentially means that it's a it's a single number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't have any columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't have any row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.820
<v Speaker 0>It's a scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, because we're going to use that in the, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 0>the rest of the lecture quite extensively.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 0>Please don't log out of book club in this lecture

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,79,86,100,100,100]}

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 0>because I haven't copied the QR all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 0>So while we while we are still at the beginning,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,99,99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 0>I'm happy to go back and show you the QR

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 0>to log in again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,79,100]}

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 0>But as we go further down, um, it would take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.669
<v Speaker 0>me quite a long time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 0>Second question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 0>True or false?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 0>Let's keep investigating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, the cofactor and how the cofactor is related to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,98,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.140
<v Speaker 0>the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 0>We've seen that the the determinant of the matrix and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 0>the cofactors are, um, are strictly related.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.380
<v Speaker 0>We've seen an important theorem which states that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 0>take the cofactor expansion over all rows and all columns,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.110
<v Speaker 0>and we get the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.650
<v Speaker 0>And so I'm going to update the question on bookclub.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.560
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully that should update it for you as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 0>Uh just going to show you the the QR once

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,67,67,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.900
<v Speaker 0>more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.980
<v Speaker 0>If you are having trouble perhaps you've been locked out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 0>And in the meantime I'll give you some time to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 0>think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.530
<v Speaker 0>But what I'm saying is the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.290
<v Speaker 0>We can write as the sum over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.010
<v Speaker 0>For example, am I taking the sum of our column

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,89,100]}

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 0>or a row there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100]}

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.820
<v Speaker 0>Raise your hand if you think I'm taking the expansion

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.570
<v Speaker 0>over a row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.630
<v Speaker 0>Raise your hand if you think I'm taking it over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.290
<v Speaker 0>the column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 0>Those are still too few hands, so let's think again

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.160
<v Speaker 0>and we will vote again in 30s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.120
<v Speaker 0>Anyone who thinks I'm taking the the expansion of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,51,90]}

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 0>row now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.450
<v Speaker 0>Anyone who thinks I'm taking it over a column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so the key, the key thing to see here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.940
<v Speaker 0>is how does that some behaves that some changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.800
<v Speaker 0>The second element of the indices of the of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.220
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.780
<v Speaker 0>So it changes the j.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 0>And I'm and I'm expanding over the element I, j

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.720
<v Speaker 0>and j refers to the column as we've just seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 0>in question one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.110
<v Speaker 0>And so that may be a little bit confusing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 0>But if you think about that, the column is changing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.620
<v Speaker 0>all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.150
<v Speaker 0>And the row which is expressed by IE stays constant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,42,100,100]}

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 0>instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.600
<v Speaker 0>So that is a deceptive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 0>It's a correct but a little bit deceptive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.190
<v Speaker 0>You have to think about it a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, because the column is changing, I am actually expanding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 0>over the ith row because if you think about what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 0>that would, that expression really is, is something as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:49.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, I one times the determinant of a i1 plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:56.480
<v Speaker 0>a I2 plus a i3, and so on and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.960
<v Speaker 0>forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.470
<v Speaker 0>And so as you can see, these is just the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.740
<v Speaker 0>ith row of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.470
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.500
<v Speaker 0>Back to the main question now is that the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.980
<v Speaker 0>uh, the right formula for the cofactor expansion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.600
<v Speaker 0>Let me see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.730
<v Speaker 0>How's it going?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100]}

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.700
<v Speaker 0>Oh, split down in the middle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.960
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.530
<v Speaker 0>Since we are so split, I would like to to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.200
<v Speaker 0>take a minute and discuss with your neighbours Why do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,58]}

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.100
<v Speaker 0>you think your opinion is the correct one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.150
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100]}

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.630
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to mute myself for a minute and hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's see how we are doing now via a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.940
<v Speaker 0>raise of hands once again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.750
<v Speaker 0>If you think that is the correct excuse me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 0>If you think that that is the correct expansion expansion

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.610
<v Speaker 0>for the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.380
<v Speaker 0>Now raise your hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85]}

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:08.990
<v Speaker 0>Down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.540
<v Speaker 0>If you think it's not, raise your hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.580
<v Speaker 0>It is not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.930
<v Speaker 0>That is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.190
<v Speaker 0>And again these expressions are tricky right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.440
<v Speaker 0>They're they're they're deceptive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 0>If they're I would have put if I put their

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 0>I j psi of a then that would have been

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,96,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.380
<v Speaker 0>the right the right expansion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.480
<v Speaker 0>But here I just put the determinant of the minor

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.380
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.210
<v Speaker 0>And so what am I missing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 0>Anyone?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.430
<v Speaker 0>The sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.590
<v Speaker 0>The sign of the cofactor I forgot to put in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.070
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.650
<v Speaker 0>And that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.980
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 0>The cofactor expansion down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 0>And as you can see, it looks much the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 0>But when we really go to the to the origin

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 0>of how we expand the determinants, we have three terms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 0>And then what we do is we collect the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 0>and the third one and we call it the the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 0>cofactor.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 0>So in there I've always I've also put the definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 0>of the cofactor implicitly if you want whatever multiplies I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 0>j to get the determinant into that sum that will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 0>be the cofactor.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 0>So these exercises are quite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 0>Quite tricky.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, because matrices are trickier than numbers, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 0>There's much more structure about matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 0>There's much more results that that we're going to see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 0>in this course than on numbers alone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,99]}

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 0>So we need to tread carefully when we engage with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 0>matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 0>It's very important to make sure that you're following the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 0>results, um, quite closely because even something that may look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 0>like it's correct, like the expression above, which is like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 0>very similar to the correct one, but it's slightly off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, it may not work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 0>Any questions so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 0>The next exercise is a little bit, um, more structured

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 0>in the sense that, uh, I don't know if you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 0>done this during the reading, but one of the suggestions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 0>that I really have for anyone approaching determinants and cofactor

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 0>expansion for the for the first time is trying to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 0>get used to them as much as possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 0>And so I've set aside four minutes, five minutes in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,94,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 0>this lecture for you to practice on a three by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 0>three matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 0>So what I would like you to do is to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.010
<v Speaker 0>write down the cofactor, the determinant cofactor expansion for that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Speaker 0>matrix and choosing two different rows, and then show that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 0>you get the same result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.089
<v Speaker 0>As a spoiler alert.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.939
<v Speaker 0>I'll be doing that for the first and second rows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:11.900
<v Speaker 0>So if you do that then you can check against

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 0>my work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.079
<v Speaker 0>If you do something else and you still find that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 0>they're the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:21.079
<v Speaker 0>That's still a pretty solid suggestion that you're that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100]}

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 0>have done things correctly as an extra if you finish

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 0>early, um, or maybe at home, because calculating three in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 0>a row gets pretty boring.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 0>You can try and prove that also along the column

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 0>and everything works okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 0>That is the big result of the reading for this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 0>for this, for this lecture that we are not able

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.630
<v Speaker 0>to prove yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 0>If you notice in the in the in the book,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.200
<v Speaker 0>there's a note that, well that says something like we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,99,100,65,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.850
<v Speaker 0>we were going to prove this result in section 3.6

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.670
<v Speaker 0>I think, which is in a few weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.190
<v Speaker 0>So we have to take it for granted for now,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.400
<v Speaker 0>but we can check on some special cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.330
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what's happening with the connection to my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.270
<v Speaker 0>tablet, but I can plug it in again and see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.200
<v Speaker 0>how it goes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'm going to start my solution to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.100
<v Speaker 0>If you haven't finished, that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.890
<v Speaker 0>You can catch up as we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so this is the first, uh, cofactor expansion

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.910
<v Speaker 0>along the first row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.200
<v Speaker 0>What I've done is exactly applying the first formula where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 0>I was equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.350
<v Speaker 0>I controls the row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 0>And as you can see in the first sum, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:31.120
<v Speaker 0>second index of the of the elements that multiply the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.080
<v Speaker 0>determinant changes, and so the row is going through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.580
<v Speaker 0>three rows of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.180
<v Speaker 0>And then I expand the smaller determinants which for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,54,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.240
<v Speaker 0>two by two matrix we know we can write out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.200
<v Speaker 0>explicitly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 0>And then I expand everything okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 0>So that is the correct hopefully expression of the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 0>of A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 0>And the result that we have seen was that if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 0>I do it along another row then everything works out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 0>And if you do it for another row, um, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 0>get that expression there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 0>And how do we check that they are the same?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 0>Well, we need to check that they contain the same,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 0>um, the same, uh, triple products.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just going to highlight a few and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 0>I'll let you finish this, For example, the triple product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 0>of the three diagonal members are here and here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 0>This triple product here, which contains minus A1 one, also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 0>appears here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 0>I think that's the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, the third one here contains minus A1221, three three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 0>That's this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, you know what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 0>Let's just do them all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.320
<v Speaker 0>It's not that long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.060
<v Speaker 0>122331 is here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.470
<v Speaker 0>One, three with plus must be this one because the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 0>other one has minus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, it's the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 0>And then the last one is here okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 0>So the theorem in this particular case is working if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 0>we expand over different rows Um, then everything, um, everything,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Speaker 0>uh, provides us with the with the same correct result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,40,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 0>So in the summary that I was presenting to you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 0>earlier about the cofactor expansion and the determined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,99,100,82]}

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 0>Sorry, that is shaking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what was happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,64,97]}

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, which was this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 0>I need to add a little remark here that also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 0>says we can actually do it however we like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 0>Why is this important?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 0>It's important because if you have a row that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 0>mostly zeros or mostly ones, but zeros are better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,99,100,100]}

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.030
<v Speaker 0>If we choose that row or column, then our expansion

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 0>is greatly, greatly simplified because whenever an element is zero,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 0>the whole term, including the determinant of the matrix multiplies.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 0>It goes away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.340
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it's it's a practically important result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.360
<v Speaker 0>In that sense, it helps us calculate determinants a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 0>bit easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 0>Any questions about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 0>Note that this is not a proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 0>We've proven it for two rows in a three by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 0>three matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.990
<v Speaker 0>If I were to ask you to prove it for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.950
<v Speaker 0>a five by five matrix, then we'd be spending the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.230
<v Speaker 0>whole hour just doing my nodes, minor determinants and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.120
<v Speaker 0>calculating everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.920
<v Speaker 0>So okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.330
<v Speaker 0>Question five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, now the question starts to become, in my opinion,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.250
<v Speaker 0>at least a little bit more interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, we're sort of approaching assessment territory here, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.030
<v Speaker 0>so far was just some definitions here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.590
<v Speaker 0>We need to think about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:24.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.140
<v Speaker 0>So we have that matrix M which has that structure

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:29.710
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.800
<v Speaker 0>We have some numbers that I haven't specified but I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.600
<v Speaker 0>want those numbers to be non zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100,100,88,88]}

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.030
<v Speaker 0>So d1 d2 and d3 are non zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.050
<v Speaker 0>And then we have zeros below them and above them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.300
<v Speaker 0>Um we can choose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.490
<v Speaker 0>We have uh if we choose them positive numbers we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.610
<v Speaker 0>get matrix A some some positive numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.340
<v Speaker 0>If we choose them equal to zero we get matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:58.750
<v Speaker 0>B, and if we choose them negative we get matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.140
<v Speaker 0>C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.840
<v Speaker 0>And my question to you again refer to the book

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.310

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, what is the relation between the determinants of the

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.270
<v Speaker 0>three matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.970
<v Speaker 0>You will have a few options to choose from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.370
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything we can say?

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.510
<v Speaker 0>Do we have enough information to make an informed decision

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.820
<v Speaker 0>about how the three determinants sort of work and or

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.990
<v Speaker 0>compare against each other, or we don't have enough information?

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.900
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a minute to discuss and come up

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.750
<v Speaker 0>with your with your solution to this.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's see how the first answers are coming in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.020
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, there's a pretty clear majority that thinks that the

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.410
<v Speaker 0>three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.020
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I forgot the last determinant there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.330
<v Speaker 0>That should be determinant of C, obviously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,98,100]}

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.140
<v Speaker 0>Sorry about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.660
<v Speaker 0>But you correctly guess the answer despite my error.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.430
<v Speaker 0>Well what is going on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.790
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone summarise in a few words what's happening here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.210
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, just just go for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:21.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.270
<v Unknown>The determinant is the product of the entry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,100,99,100,100,52]}

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the start values are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,54,100,100]}

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:38.830
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:39.160
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.850
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.360
<v Speaker 0>The key observation here is that if we take those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Speaker 0>values to be zero, we get a diagonal matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.580
<v Speaker 0>If we take them to be anything else, we get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.560
<v Speaker 0>an upper triangular matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.520
<v Speaker 0>But the second key observation is that for both the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.430
<v Speaker 0>formula to calculate the determinant, the simplified version of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.630
<v Speaker 0>determinant is the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.450
<v Speaker 0>It's just the product of the three diagonal well, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.390
<v Speaker 0>n diagonal terms in general, in this case three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.130
<v Speaker 0>So you have correctly identified that, uh, that is indeed,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:17.050
<v Speaker 0>um, that it's it's indeed irrelevant whether we assign zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.240
<v Speaker 0>or non-zero values to the stars up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.660
<v Speaker 0>And so these are the two propositions that were in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.800
<v Speaker 0>one of the videos, um, literally taken from the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.330
<v Speaker 0>deck of slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.670
<v Speaker 0>Even if we had put the stars on the lower

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.890
<v Speaker 0>triangle, because for both upper and lower triangular matrices, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.850
<v Speaker 0>the formula still holds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.180
<v Speaker 0>And if you have seen the video, I make a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:52.900
<v Speaker 0>comment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.790
<v Speaker 0>I say because of this, diagonal matrices are nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.050
<v Speaker 0>And actually triangular matrices are just as nice as, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69]}

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:06.340
<v Speaker 0>diagonal matrices if we have one of them calculating the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.120
<v Speaker 0>determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.320
<v Speaker 0>I'm so sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.390
<v Speaker 0>Uh, calculating the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100]}

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:17.110
<v Speaker 0>The determinant is not about taking a minor determinant and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 0>combining them and expanding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.490
<v Speaker 0>We just do a multiplication of a few numbers and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.180
<v Speaker 0>we're done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.780
<v Speaker 0>So 1st May think, well, we have seen how to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:30.340
<v Speaker 0>reduce a matrix to an upper triangular matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:31.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.940
<v Speaker 0>What's the keyword for doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.010
<v Speaker 0>How how did we call the result of that of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.030
<v Speaker 0>that operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 0>Just scream it if you have it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 0>The row operation that puts it in row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 0>That is an upper an upper triangular matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 0>So one might think, well, if I don't know how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 0>to calculate the determinant, but I know how to put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,47,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 0>it in row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 0>Could I do a row echelon form and then just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 0>multiply the diagonal and find the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 0>The answer is yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 0>And that is the next exercise that I invite you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 0>to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 0>This is not this is a matrix that already starts

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 0>to be a little bit in row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.600
<v Speaker 0>So you can see I put some zeros and some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 0>easy numbers in the lower part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I would like you to try to put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 0>in row echelon form for the sake of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.640
<v Speaker 0>I know that you're very familiar with that, but I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 0>going to give you the row operation so we don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 0>waste time with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 0>And I want you to calculate the determinant by using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 0>the row echelon form okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 0>So again it's not a massive amount of computation but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 0>it is some computations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to give you two more minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 0>I'll come around and then we will wrap up this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,81,81,100,100,100]}

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Speaker 0>question together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 0>Any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:57.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.430
<v Speaker 0>I had muted myself now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55]}

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so as usual, lectures are very short.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.820
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry but I need to move on if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.350
<v Speaker 0>have done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Speaker 0>Oh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.040
<v Speaker 0>I put it in the other order okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.970
<v Speaker 0>And we know that these type of uh, of operations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,97,100,79,100,100]}

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.030
<v Speaker 0>are allowed because they don't change the solutions of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:03.990
<v Speaker 0>system, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.120
<v Speaker 0>That's week one, Ila.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,96,100,70]}

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.190
<v Speaker 0>Do they change the determinant?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100]}

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.140
<v Speaker 0>Raise your hand if yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.860
<v Speaker 0>Raise your hand if no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.840
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:25.080
<v Speaker 0>They do, but they do it in a predictable way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.600
<v Speaker 0>So we can account for the change that we introduced

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.800
<v Speaker 0>by doing that and then go back and correct for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.220
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.660
<v Speaker 0>And what I mean is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.220
<v Speaker 0>And when we do so it's a valid method to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.460
<v Speaker 0>calculate the determinant by putting everything in row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.460
<v Speaker 0>But we need to be careful about how we're changing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.390
<v Speaker 0>the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.840
<v Speaker 0>So this these are the three rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.570
<v Speaker 0>As we've seen in one of the videos.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.930
<v Speaker 0>If you swap two columns or two rows the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:55.620
<v Speaker 0>changes sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.800
<v Speaker 0>So whenever we swap columns or rows we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.950
<v Speaker 0>remember that we are introducing a times minus one into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,64,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.850
<v Speaker 0>the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.540
<v Speaker 0>If we're multiplying a row again, that was one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.419
<v Speaker 0>the basic results of the determinant one of the basic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:10.169
<v Speaker 0>properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.870
<v Speaker 0>Then if we multiply a row or a column, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.440
<v Speaker 0>multiply the determinant by the same factor.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.460
<v Speaker 0>Same needs to be different than zero here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:22.620
<v Speaker 0>I cannot multiply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.440
<v Speaker 0>I mean I can multiply something by zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Speaker 0>But then I get the determinant equal to zero and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.620
<v Speaker 0>I never recover.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,77]}

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.480
<v Speaker 0>So it's not a smart move.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.850
<v Speaker 0>And instead if I combine two or more rows then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.990
<v Speaker 0>it doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.310
<v Speaker 0>Linear combinations of rows or columns do not change the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.030
<v Speaker 0>determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay, with that in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.879
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully I have done the calculations through variational form correctly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,30,50,64,100]}

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 0>We should check with one of you probably, but let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.730
<v Speaker 0>assume that this is what we get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.620
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 0>The determinant of this matrix is just minus four, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.800
<v Speaker 0>it's just the product of the elements on the diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.410
<v Speaker 0>And if you remember which operations we've done, which were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,44]}

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 0>these ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,98]}

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, the first three are linear combination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.130
<v Speaker 0>So we don't change the determinant at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.470
<v Speaker 0>But the last one we have to swap the last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:30.540
<v Speaker 0>and the second to last row, because otherwise the minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.600
<v Speaker 0>two two would spoil the lower triangular property of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.290
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 0>And so if this matrix that the reduced row echelon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 0>form of the first one has determined and minus four,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100]}

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 0>then the original determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 0>How to be four okay, because we changed its sign

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 0>when we swapped the rows at the last step okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 0>So this is another option for calculating determinants a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 0>bit more effectively and more and with less probability of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 0>making an algebra mistake, probably then just going through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 0>whole expansion for big matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 0>Note that this one was a 4x4, and so in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 0>principle, a 4x4 is very hard to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, to do directly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's not hard, it's just long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 0>And the chances of making mistakes are plentiful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 0>And with that in mind, the next exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 0>Can we do a five by five?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 0>There's no way we can fit the calculation of general

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 0>determinants five by five by the end of the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 0>Like that's just something that we cannot do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 0>So we need to do something a little bit smarter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 0>and use one of the properties that that we've seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 0>in the, in the reading and in the videos.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 0>And um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 0>can you see how to do that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 0>Now, again, only for the interest of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm going to give you one minute to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 0>about it, and then I'm going to spoil the result

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 0>for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 0>But give it a think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 0>Look at the structure of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.890
<v Speaker 0>Maybe you can manipulate a little bit and obtain something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 0>that's a little bit more reasonable than doing a five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 0>by five or in one go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 0>Remember, whenever you do a five by five, at every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.180
<v Speaker 0>step of the expansion, you get a determinant 4x4, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 0>you need to expand again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.480
<v Speaker 0>And then so you get five determinants 4x4 each expanded

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 0>four times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 0>That's 20.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.680
<v Speaker 0>And those are determinants three by three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 0>So you get 60 terms to compute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 0>If you were doing that directly you can cut it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 0>down by expanding along the first column for example which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 0>has two zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77]}

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.830
<v Speaker 0>But it's it's still going to leave you with a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 0>lot of algebra to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 0>What do you see in the structure of that matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 0>Anyone?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 2>The third and fourth columns we get a block of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,88]}

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 0>So it's not quite in block format, but almost if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 0>we swap the the third and the fourth column, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 0>get a upper triangular block matrix, a matrix which has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 0>it's divided in blocks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 0>And the lower block and the lower block on the

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.210
<v Speaker 0>left hand side is all made of zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.540
<v Speaker 0>And as we've seen, this is what we get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.490
<v Speaker 0>And as we've seen in the, in the, in the

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:50.790
<v Speaker 0>reading, um, this is much easier to calculate because for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.640
<v Speaker 0>an upper or lower triangular block matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.520
<v Speaker 0>The determinant is just the product of the determinant of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.810
<v Speaker 0>the blocks and the diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,67,100,100]}

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:03.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay, we started with 60 terms a little bit less

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.990
<v Speaker 0>because there were zeros in the original matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.230
<v Speaker 0>Here we do just for the three expansion for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.290
<v Speaker 0>three by three and the two by two block at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.520
<v Speaker 0>the bottom right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:24.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is just, um, um, an exercise to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.720
<v Speaker 0>really point out that looking at possible structural properties of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.690
<v Speaker 0>the matrix, if you can identify patterns in how the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.970
<v Speaker 0>matrix is constructed, you can really count down your computations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.550
<v Speaker 0>with respect to a normal, uh, sort of direct approach.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Well, swapping the columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,70]}

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.610
<v Speaker 0>Yes, you have you have to keep in mind that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.160
<v Speaker 0>when you swap the column, you change that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.140
<v Speaker 0>And I think I kept track of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:56.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.820
<v Speaker 0>Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.680
<v Speaker 0>Don't forget the minus sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.420
<v Speaker 0>It's all good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.380
<v Speaker 0>But we need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.750
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, if you see there it's minus the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 0>determinant times the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.290
<v Speaker 0>That is always a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:10.680
<v Speaker 0>Whenever you touch the matrix to manipulate it, you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.750
<v Speaker 0>to keep track of the three rules that that we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100]}

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.440
<v Speaker 0>seen above.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.230
<v Speaker 0>And then if you want to do the calculations, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.940
<v Speaker 0>there's really not anything particularly interesting in that you should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.120
<v Speaker 0>get assuming I've done the calculations correct myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.080
<v Speaker 0>-1014 okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.670
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.310
<v Speaker 0>So we've seen a 4x4, five by five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.170
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a six by six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.330
<v Speaker 0>No no no no no no I'm joking I'm joking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 0>There's no six by six today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's instead do this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.050
<v Speaker 0>Let's go back to a three by three with an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,98]}

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.480
<v Speaker 0>Within with a single element that it's not it's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,96,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.110
<v Speaker 0>known.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, so before essentially we had a matrix which had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.120
<v Speaker 0>a lot of unknowns, but it was either diagonal or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.740
<v Speaker 0>upper triangular, and we could say something about the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm sort of swapping the the premise here instead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.560
<v Speaker 0>of giving you a matrix with structure, I'm giving you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.490
<v Speaker 0>a matrix that you know much better, but it has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.530
<v Speaker 0>just one element which we don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,98,100]}

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.880
<v Speaker 0>And the question is, can we say anything about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.160
<v Speaker 0>sign of the determinant of that matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.560
<v Speaker 0>And do I have a question for this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.390
<v Speaker 0>If you go in the book club there's a question

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,94,98,100,100]}

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.790
<v Speaker 0>about this itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,48]}

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:36.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.700
<v Speaker 0>Think about how the expression of the determinant is constructed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.250
<v Speaker 0>Or you can try substituting in some values and see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.090
<v Speaker 0>what you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.760
<v Speaker 0>But essentially I'm asking if you don't know X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.060
<v Speaker 0>Can you tell me anything about the determinant of being

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.590
<v Speaker 0>positive negative or zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.570
<v Speaker 0>let's have a look at what the answers are coming

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:49.050
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.450
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a few more seconds to vote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.270
<v Speaker 0>Just because I see that only 50 have voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.780
<v Speaker 0>Try to make up your mind and send me a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.890
<v Speaker 0>yes or no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.420
<v Speaker 0>But it's not a yes or no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.320
<v Speaker 0>It's a multiple choice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.130
<v Speaker 0>But I mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'm going to uncover the answers now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,97,97,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.160
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98]}

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.360
<v Speaker 0>So the majority of you, almost two thirds think that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.120
<v Speaker 0>there's no enough there's not enough information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,100,47,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:32.490
<v Speaker 0>And, um, that would be the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.330
<v Speaker 0>But why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.930
<v Speaker 0>Well, this matrix has no structure, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.690
<v Speaker 0>There's no result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.520
<v Speaker 0>Theorem, proposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.540
<v Speaker 0>Corollary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.800
<v Speaker 0>We can hope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.320
<v Speaker 0>can in our help.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.460
<v Speaker 0>So the best approach to do this is to just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:56.460
<v Speaker 0>calculate the determinant in the boring way of expanding along

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.230
<v Speaker 0>row of or a column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,58,100,64,100]}

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.870
<v Speaker 0>Now, because we want to isolate X, because we want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.280
<v Speaker 0>to study what what the dependence on X is would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.710
<v Speaker 0>be smart to choose either the third column or the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.980
<v Speaker 0>second row, because then x is not in another determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:15.720
<v Speaker 0>It just appears as one coefficient multiplying another determinant, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.590
<v Speaker 0>is just a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.880
<v Speaker 0>And what I mean by that is is this if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.940
<v Speaker 0>we do, uh, let's expand it along the third column,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.470
<v Speaker 0>we get that and X is still our unknown.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:29.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 0>Just for reference, let's have a look at the matrix

<v Speaker 0>back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to multiply one then x.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 0>Then three x has the minus because of the rules

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 0>of the signs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.560
<v Speaker 0>And the rest are the determinants of the two by

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.520
<v Speaker 0>two remaining.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76]}

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.700
<v Speaker 0>And this does this help you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.210
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56]}

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.620
<v Speaker 0>I see head shaking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,60,100]}

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.660
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't help you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.780
<v Speaker 0>But what if I tell you that those determinants are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.800
<v Speaker 0>just numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.540
<v Speaker 0>You can just calculate those determinants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.540 --> 00:44:59.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.030
<v Speaker 0>The first one is ten minus two eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.080
<v Speaker 0>The second one is ten minus three seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.380
<v Speaker 0>And the third one is eight -12 minus four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.890
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.010
<v Speaker 0>Sorry four -12 minus eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.600
<v Speaker 0>Um let's try and do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.560
<v Speaker 0>And we get the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.150
<v Speaker 0>And x are, are related by uh essentially what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,96,100,100,48,100,100,100]}

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.020
<v Speaker 0>a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.650
<v Speaker 0>It's minus seven x minus six okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.730
<v Speaker 0>So obviously if we write the determinant as y and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.380
<v Speaker 0>we plot it in the plane, and then we study

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.830
<v Speaker 0>the sign of our determinant for some values of x,

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:44.090
<v Speaker 0>the determinant will be, uh, negative for some values will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.910

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.810
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:53.240
<v Speaker 0>And in particular for minus six seventh that matrix reduces

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,96,100,100]}

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.190
<v Speaker 0>to a matrix with zero determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.590

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.170
<v Speaker 0>It will make it so you can express the third

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.400
<v Speaker 0>I invite you to go back and check that for

<v Speaker 0>go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:25.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, the last question, um, which is, uh, sum up

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.510

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.570

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.910
<v Speaker 0>Take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.920
<v Speaker 0>Just just something.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:10.310
<v Speaker 0>Note that some of them say a i.j.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.120

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.250

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:31.520
<v Speaker 0>fair amount of people that they think that I just

<v Speaker 0>If you have some structure, it's easy to tell something

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:24.290

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.180

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.940
<v Speaker 0>We still have a minute.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.110
<v Speaker 0>Can we give some can we give some counterexamples to

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.950

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:42.050

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.030
<v Speaker 0>And the counterexample for one, you can look at the

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.610

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.550
