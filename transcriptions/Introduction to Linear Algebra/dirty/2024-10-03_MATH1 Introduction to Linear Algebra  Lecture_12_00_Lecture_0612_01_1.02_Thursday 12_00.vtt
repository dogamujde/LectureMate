00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 0>So as you see, the lecture recording has started.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 0>I just want to make you aware that that clock

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 0>there is three minutes fast.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not going by that one.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 0>Anyhow, I just want to make you aware before I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 0>start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 0>I've been asked by my peers to display this here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 0>It's a group of second and third year students who

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 0>And it can be quite useful.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, especially if you sort of think you could do

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.140

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 0>I will include that slide in the set that I'll

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.850

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, I've got the coat there because I'm going to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.010

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 0>is a different code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 0>So after that, um, linear algebra again week three.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.410

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.190

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.540

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 0>tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 0>The elementary matrices um, to some extent bridges the gap

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.920

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.920

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 0>from reading that this is pretty much two sides of

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 0>the same coin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, they're really the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 0>We're trying to bridge the gap and seeing the connection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, but before we get there, um, not this one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 0>just to sort of have a warm up, um, this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 0>sort of hangs on from last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, one poll, um, that I didn't manage to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,58,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 0>that, but we will see that something like that we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 0>going to need later at least an extension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.869
<v Speaker 0>So I'd like you at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I just need to quickly go stop this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 0>Oh, no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 0>I actually can keep this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 0>I just see I've done this cleverer than I thought

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 0>and go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we've got four choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 0>Reset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think I can display that one minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 0>Okay, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 0>Almost time up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.150
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 0>Halfway between.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 0>Halfway between A and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.320
<v Speaker 0>So, um, good that I do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm just going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 0>Well, then giving this back to you, I'm just going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,46,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.250
<v Speaker 0>to do this, um, on here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 0>So I'm asking you once this comes up in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 0>second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 0>What is a B transpose?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58]}

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the transpose of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's a couple of rules now that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.980
<v Speaker 0>have to play with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 0>At the same time, the first thing to notice is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.829
<v Speaker 0>that this sort of transpose on the B, it's only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 0>only applies to the B nor to the A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100,100]}

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 0>So this is really sort of write it as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,78,78,100]}

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.360
<v Speaker 0>times B transposed and the whole thing transposed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, now if I transpose the product of two matrices,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 0>I actually need to change the order of the matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 0>And I think that's the bit that the people who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 0>thought, um, that answer A was right had forgotten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 0>So I need to change the order of the matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 0>So I have to say this is B transposed And

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 0>the transpose of that times the first matrix A here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 0>and again the transpose of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 0>And then I can of course use that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 0>I know B transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,95,100]}

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 0>Transpose is just the matrix B, so this is B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 0>a transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 0>But do remember that we need to change the order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 0>That's the important bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 0>And that's the reason actually why I'm doing this and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 0>why I'm reminding you because we're seeing that later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that was answer B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,87,87]}

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, a related thing now in terms of using several

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 0>rules is what would you do if I ask if

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 0>I had three matches this year?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,40,100,100]}

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 0>And I ask you to say, what is A times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 0>B times C and the whole thing transposed?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, anybody's got any suspicions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>What did you see?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,74,86,97]}

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Times B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.870
<v Speaker 0>28.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[4]}

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 0>That's the sort of obvious thing you'd assume.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, you change the order, so it must hold for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.750
<v Speaker 0>any amount of matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.210
<v Speaker 0>How would you prove that, though?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,93]}

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would do A, B, c transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.490
<v Speaker 1>So do you like that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,97,100,100]}

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.610
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I know that's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,41,41,100,100]}

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.710
<v Speaker 0>And you could do it either way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.760
<v Speaker 0>You can break it down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92]}

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 0>You're perfectly right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 0>I could write this as a and then b c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.540
<v Speaker 0>and transpose it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.760
<v Speaker 0>And then now b c is sort of one matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,56,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.290
<v Speaker 0>which don't need to give a name.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.070
<v Speaker 0>It's just a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,95,100]}

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.200
<v Speaker 0>But we're just a product of two matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,85,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.770
<v Speaker 0>So we can do this as b c transpose times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 0>A transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,67]}

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 0>And now we we leave the A transpose there where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.510
<v Speaker 0>we can now do with a, b, c transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 0>Again flipping the order there so it is C transposed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600
<v Speaker 0>B transposed A transposed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,69]}

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, now question is what is it with four matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.840
<v Speaker 0>or 5 or 6 and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 0>And the suspicion, of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 0>It'll just carry on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 0>But you would have to prove it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 0>And you can't really prove it for any possible number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 0>of n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 0>So there's something called um, um, there's something called induction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,92,92,61,100,100,100]}

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 0>that you can use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 0>So proof and problem solving, you might have seen this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.010

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 0>will go further into that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 0>But I just want you to remind you of that

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 0>and also tell you the same rules apply.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 0>If we had inverses instead of transposes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, and uh, as I say, we're going to need

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 0>that um, later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.150

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 0>So ba transpose was correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,35,99,65,100]}

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.790

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 0>not that, comes later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.930
<v Speaker 0>It's the matrix that is equivalent to a row operation.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.590
<v Speaker 0>But it's just saying, uh, if we can obtain it

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100]}

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.220

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, actually, in this case, the replacing operation is just

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.870

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, um, although sort of you, it's just swapping two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.680
<v Speaker 0>rows from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.690
<v Speaker 0>But you do need a square matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the other is um, matrix A yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 0>I'm multiplying, um, the third row by two matrix C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.650
<v Speaker 0>yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, adding five times the first row to the second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, matrix B um, if you look closely, you realise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64]}

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.720
<v Speaker 0>there's actually two row operations that are in here, one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 0>after the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um, it's both swapping rows one and two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, and also more deploying the third row by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it's a combination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100]}

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 0>It's not an elementary matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 0>The elementary matrix is really just obtained by one row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 0>operation from the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100]}

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.000
<v Speaker 0>So that now leads us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, so A and C were the correct ones there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,81,100,100,100,97]}

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, that leads us to the sort of, um, relation

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.370
<v Speaker 0>this house with Gaussian elimination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 0>And Nicholson has this lemma here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, if an elementary row operation put this on both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.330
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, if an elementary row operation is performed on a

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.310
<v Speaker 0>m times n matrix, the matrix we are performing that

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.900

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, the result is the matrix E, where E is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.620
<v Speaker 0>the M times M square.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.490
<v Speaker 0>No elementary matrix corresponding to that operation.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, now, I don't know how you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 0>When I first read that, I had to read that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.870
<v Speaker 0>about three times to understand what Nicholson actually meant by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.350
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.410
<v Speaker 0>So let me paraphrase that a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.840
<v Speaker 0>So what is it saying is the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,71,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I've got a matrix A here, and I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.900
<v Speaker 0>performing an elementary row operation on that matrix to get,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.650
<v Speaker 0>um, the matrix, a dash here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,55,94]}

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then I say that this elementary row operation,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.650
<v Speaker 0>um, corresponds to the matrix E.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.620
<v Speaker 0>Well, then I have that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.550
<v Speaker 0>I could also get a dash here by taking E

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.870

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I say if I have an elementary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.880
<v Speaker 0>row operation, um, and I'm going to call this R

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 0>here now performed on a matrix so that by this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.360
<v Speaker 0>row operation, I'm transferring the matrix A into the matrix

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.140
<v Speaker 0>E dash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,96]}

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, this thing that the matrix E here should correspond

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 0>to that row operation means by what we had earlier

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 0>that if I apply the same row operation to the

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 0>identity matrix here, then I'm going to get the matrix

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 0>E that's the elementary matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, then I also have that a dash here equals

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.100

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 0>That's where the reset is hidden.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 0>Three choices displayed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,33]}

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, almost at the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.010
<v Speaker 0>B and indeed B is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.400
<v Speaker 0>So, um, it's obvious that what we've started swapping rows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,81,86,100,100]}

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.910
<v Speaker 0>one and two, um, and all of these three things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.740
<v Speaker 0>have somehow swapped rows one and two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.140
<v Speaker 0>The question is just what is your starting point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.650
<v Speaker 0>And you're swapping you've got two rows here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.260
<v Speaker 0>So your starting point has got to be something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.130
<v Speaker 0>And I mentioned two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,96,100,90]}

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.980
<v Speaker 0>And we have to have a square matrix to start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.430
<v Speaker 0>with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.950
<v Speaker 0>Um so B here is the correct starting point in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 0>order to swap rows one and two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.720
<v Speaker 0>I did stress that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 0>See here that we can't have but we have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 0>have square matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise I thought at beginning that it seems quite logical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 0>that you want something to match the dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,97]}

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 0>But no, you want something a square matrix in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 0>row dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 0>So last thing on the sort of just playing around

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.350
<v Speaker 0>with elementary matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, so all elementary matrices are actually invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, which is a nice property because all elementary row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 0>operations we can reverse, we can do the opposite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 0>So let's give you an example here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 0>So I've got this matrix either similar to what we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 0>had earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 0>And I want you to know what is the what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 0>you want you to tell me or think about what

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.820
<v Speaker 0>is the inverse of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.200
<v Speaker 0>And I'm hoping you that the inverse actually is by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.280
<v Speaker 0>just replacing that five on the bottom left corner by

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.780
<v Speaker 0>a different number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.530
<v Speaker 0>But what should be the number you want to replace

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.370
<v Speaker 0>it with?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.340
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.340
<v Speaker 0>Five choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.480
<v Speaker 0>Reset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.950
<v Speaker 0>And play.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63]}

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.880
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:41.830
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, it gives you the time, I guess, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.230
<v Speaker 0>to, like, um, two minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 0>I only want at one minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,52,100,100]}

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.790
<v Speaker 0>Really?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.940
<v Speaker 0>I stopped this after one minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay, ten more seconds and then I'll go to the

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 0>results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 0>So the votes are coming in and you can keep

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.360

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, and most people have said B, which indeed turns

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.860
<v Speaker 0>out to be the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.830
<v Speaker 0>But now the question is, I mean, I am n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,84,83]}

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 0>two to, um, I am n to remember all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.710
<v Speaker 0>these inverses and no, you're not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.090
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I don't know them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.660
<v Speaker 0>I wouldn't have been able to tell you offhand which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.190
<v Speaker 0>one of those is the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.490
<v Speaker 0>Um, but you should know how to work these out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.370
<v Speaker 0>by first principles or so, and I just want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.560
<v Speaker 0>quickly go through that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.300
<v Speaker 0>So what we're wanting here is that we say we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.620
<v Speaker 0>got this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what's our matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:29.380
<v Speaker 0>One, one, one and a five down here 00000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we want to find the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.690
<v Speaker 0>So in other words, we want to find a matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.190
<v Speaker 0>here, um, such that if we multiply that, we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.510
<v Speaker 0>to get the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, um, so now, of course, I could try playing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.300
<v Speaker 0>around and then saying, okay, this is a matrix A,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,92,93,100,62]}

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.800
<v Speaker 0>B, C, D and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,62,62,100,100,100]}

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, and let's sort of make a system of equations,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.170
<v Speaker 0>see whether I can work out whether zeros are, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,57]}

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.970
<v Speaker 0>what it should be, or I can take the hint

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.220
<v Speaker 0>and saying only actually I need one element there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, but I can do it in a different way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.480
<v Speaker 0>So I'm pretty more deploying here with something that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.940
<v Speaker 0>know is going to be an elementary row operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 0>So an elementary matrix and I want to do is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,60]}

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.660
<v Speaker 0>such that this here becomes the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 0>So from what we've done before, all I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 0>work out is what row operations do I have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51,51,100]}

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 0>do on this matrix here in order to get the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 0>identity?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 0>Well, so how how does that work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 0>Which row operation is the right one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.230
<v Speaker 0>Becomes all three minus five times a one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,75,100,100,100,100,52,97]}

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.650
<v Speaker 0>So I can't get that to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 0>If I replace the third row, um, with the third

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>row minus five times the first row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.090
<v Speaker 0>Well, so what I need to do is I need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.530
<v Speaker 0>to replace the third row, um, by the third row,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 0>minus five times the first row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if we applying this here, the elementary matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 0>corresponding to that is indeed, uh, starting with the identity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.260
<v Speaker 0>and then just five times minus five times the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.020
<v Speaker 0>row added onto that is the minus five here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, that should be it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.330
<v Speaker 0>And you can now go through and just check that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.770
<v Speaker 0>this indeed holds here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87]}

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.310
<v Speaker 0>So one times one gives me one, one times this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.290
<v Speaker 0>one or the ones on different locations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.550
<v Speaker 0>So it all cancels.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.490
<v Speaker 0>This one here I have a one times minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.720
<v Speaker 0>plus one times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.040
<v Speaker 0>Sorry one times minus five plus one times five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.490
<v Speaker 0>Cancel.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.480
<v Speaker 0>It gives me the zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.540
<v Speaker 0>And you can go through um that this works, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.310
<v Speaker 0>just sort of playing a little bit with what we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.680
<v Speaker 0>know about elementary row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.270
<v Speaker 0>So that's sort of enough about this sort of algebra

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.460
<v Speaker 0>and how the whole thing works and how we recognise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.940
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.670
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's time to have a little bit of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.310
<v Speaker 0>that tells us about the nature of matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, what we've done so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.470
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing is, um, I was wondering why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.490
<v Speaker 0>why are these things called elementary matrices?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 0>So is it like this guy that says, this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100,100]}

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 0>really elementary?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 0>There should be really, really easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 0>And that's why the elementary matrices, it's just it's just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 0>a simple thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100]}

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, you might think so, but I don't think that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.000
<v Speaker 0>that's what why it's called elementary matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 0>Rather, I think what we've got here is something like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:31.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 0>You can think of elementary matrices as something like Lego

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:35.830
<v Speaker 0>blocks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.760
<v Speaker 0>These are the building blocks of anything else of any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 0>other, actually any other invertible matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we will see that this sort of final

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,96,96,100,100,41,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 0>result really of that session.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83]}

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 0>So that's what, um, elementary means in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 0>These are the building blocks of other matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:55.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 0>There are, there are this sort of most, most basic,

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.970
<v Speaker 0>most simple elementary, um, invertible matrices that you can think

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 0>of apart from the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.580
<v Speaker 0>But really, I think it's the building blocks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, going into that, um, I've got another poll which

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.730

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.980

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:25.140

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.850

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.030
<v Speaker 0>I can get from A to B by elementary row

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.650

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.700
<v Speaker 0>not just one a sequence of k row operations.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I denote by e1, e2, e, k the

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.500

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.080

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 0>write the new matrix B as something like u times

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.330
<v Speaker 0>Not multiple answers.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:54.340

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.260
<v Speaker 0>um, by thinking, um, so what do we have?

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we know that we're going to get our matrix

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.020

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.129
<v Speaker 0>Um, we saying, first of all, we going to apply

00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:22.830
<v Speaker 0>the elementary row operation E1 to it.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.460
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to start with, um, applying E1 to

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:26.909
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then so this becomes the new matrix here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.899
<v Speaker 0>And after that we are applying E2 to that, um,

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:34.919
<v Speaker 0>and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:40.110
<v Speaker 0>And then E3, um, and we carry on until finally

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.659
<v Speaker 0>we apply e k to the whole thing as the

00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:47.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, and of course, um, this is now lots of

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.210
<v Speaker 0>brackets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.270
<v Speaker 0>We know we can, we can re bracket the whole

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.570
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:55.350
<v Speaker 0>We can write this here as EQ times, times E3,

<v Speaker 0>times e2 times E1, um, and that whole thing times,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 0>eh?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then, uh, this here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,99]}

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, the combination of all these elementary row operations, we

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 0>can just call you, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 0>And that was the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 0>The answer?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 0>See?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:16.220
<v Speaker 0>There.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.810
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 0>How do we get this to you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,96]}

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 0>And again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what I've shown you before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this here, um, this is really was from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.760
<v Speaker 0>a theorem 2.51 and Nicholson.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,42,100]}

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the theorem actually did have a third part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, so here's the theorem again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, so a suppose that A and B are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,48,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.330
<v Speaker 0>matrices such that you can get from A to B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.710
<v Speaker 0>by row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:54.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, then we know that we can write B as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.530
<v Speaker 0>two times a and we've got um a representation of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.680
<v Speaker 0>U.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.990
<v Speaker 0>That's what we've just done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:04.840
<v Speaker 0>And also Nicholson says the following that indeed we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,78]}

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.900
<v Speaker 0>compute you by, um, oops, doing this here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, what we've known for the, um, or what I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.020
<v Speaker 0>showed you as the algorithm to correct to, to get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,34,100,100]}

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:17.890
<v Speaker 0>inverses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we can start with an augmented system here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.800
<v Speaker 0>that we have the matrix A augmented by the identity,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.400
<v Speaker 0>apply row operations to A, so that we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.270
<v Speaker 0>get to be um, at the same time the identity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.330
<v Speaker 0>matrix here would be transformed to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I showed you that last time as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,76,50]}

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.180
<v Speaker 0>way to, to get the identity as a sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.800
<v Speaker 0>this is just the magic trick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, why does it work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.640
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we now know or have the, um, half

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,85]}

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.480
<v Speaker 0>a bit of an understanding and know why this would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:52.780
<v Speaker 0>work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.130
<v Speaker 0>Let me just check that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm not ahead of myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what we're saying is basically the following, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 0>that we're saying that if I've got my matrix A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:07.770
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I say I can get by elementary by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 0>some row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.310
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to call these row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 0>Are you here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I take this here IU, I'm going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 0>to get as the row operation, um, the corresponding to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 0>the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 0>You I'm going to get to matrix U a and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.840
<v Speaker 0>this matrix here is um b this is what I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 0>call b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.940
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to get from A to B by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 0>row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.640
<v Speaker 0>Um I these row operations I call ru and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100]}

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 0>as the sort of combination of matrices that corresponds to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 0>That's the setup there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100]}

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I now do and say I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 0>apply a same row operations here, um, to the matrix,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.370
<v Speaker 0>I to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:01.550
<v Speaker 0>What I'm getting to is also you times I know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,62]}

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.650
<v Speaker 0>and just this gives me the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 0>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 0>And that indeed is what this is saying that if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.970
<v Speaker 0>I the same row operations that take A to B,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.810
<v Speaker 0>if I apply them to I um, that will give

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,79,100,100,100]}

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.190
<v Speaker 0>me the matrix U.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79]}

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, and of course you could ask the matrix B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:21.410
<v Speaker 0>that you wanted to get to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.720
<v Speaker 0>You could choose the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100]}

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if you're doing that, um, this will now

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 0>give you the proof that indeed what you're getting out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 0>of the process, in the position of you there is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.740
<v Speaker 0>the inverse of the matrix you started with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.050
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, think about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,77,100,100,99]}

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, that just said, this is the reason why the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,54,55,35,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.450
<v Speaker 0>whole thing works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think let me just check where I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.560
<v Speaker 0>am at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 0>I'm totally sure I might.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's let me let me just do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to do an another example on this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,49,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 0>Did I, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, I did one two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,99,60,42]}

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 0>So, um, let's just have another example on the whole

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.040
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.310
<v Speaker 0>Uh, keep this up here and say, let's say I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 0>got matrices A is uh, one, two, three, four and

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 0>the matrix B is six, 812.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so um, have a look at these.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 0>quickly that you can't get from A to B by,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 0>uh, two actually row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,99,99,100]}

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, and let's just try this sort of algorithm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.780
<v Speaker 0>So we've got one, two, three, four and we say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.270
<v Speaker 0>we want to apply the same thing here to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.100
<v Speaker 0>identity matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.750
<v Speaker 0>So can anybody tell me a row operation that will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.240
<v Speaker 0>get me at least in the right direction?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.200
<v Speaker 0>What should I do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 0>So for a one row run it were two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,91,92,100,85,100,99,89]}

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's start with that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 0>That at least gives us here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.270
<v Speaker 0>So if we're swapping that um, so R1 swap with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.110
<v Speaker 0>R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:26.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, that will give us a uh 3412.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,89]}

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.930
<v Speaker 0>We're doing the same thing on the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.810
<v Speaker 0>So this will give us A0110.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the other operation, what else do we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.420
<v Speaker 0>to multiply?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 0>Row one by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.610
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.730
<v Speaker 0>So row one gets replaced by two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:45.540
<v Speaker 0>Row one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.440
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so this will now give us six, eight one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:49.950
<v Speaker 0>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:54.470
<v Speaker 0>On the other hand 0210.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90]}

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is B uh, we got there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,89,100,100,98]}

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, and, uh, so this here is B, this here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:08.330
<v Speaker 0>is, you know, um, and we can now check that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,97,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 0>um, u times a equals to be, you know, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,97,97,100]}

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.160
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to do that here at the moment,

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.590
<v Speaker 0>but it's the whole process at work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.670
<v Speaker 0>You take those matrices, multiply them out, convince yourself that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.830
<v Speaker 0>this actually does work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, just to warn you, you may very well get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 0>something like this exercise that a heart here in a

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.800

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 0>So it's a, it's a popular, um, it's a popular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 0>thing to ask.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 0>I say this also applies to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we now know how to get from A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.890
<v Speaker 0>to B by elementary row operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.380
<v Speaker 0>And what this does with a matrix view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,73]}

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.710
<v Speaker 0>The question is can I always go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.110
<v Speaker 0>So once I've done that I have a way from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.970
<v Speaker 0>A to B with a matrix view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.780
<v Speaker 0>Do I know that I can always reverse that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.780
<v Speaker 0>So what do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.640
<v Speaker 0>No, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99]}

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.960
<v Speaker 0>Why does this not work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.770
<v Speaker 0>Have I've forgotten?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,89]}

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.030
<v Speaker 0>Reset.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.710
<v Speaker 0>Reset.

<v Speaker 0>Display.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.810
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:49.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:49.740
<v Speaker 0>It works now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,32,58]}

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.450
<v Speaker 0>By 10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100]}

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 0>Majority think it's always and indeed it is always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.000
<v Speaker 0>So and again just just quickly sort of talk you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.180
<v Speaker 0>through the argument, um, why this would be the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 0>So we have seen that if we go from a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.630
<v Speaker 0>um, to be elementary row operation, um, that means that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34,100,34,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 0>we know that we can write B as you times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 0>A, we use invertible, you know?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78,78]}

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 0>So you as this sort of, uh, combination of elementary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.590
<v Speaker 0>matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, now, of course, we can now multiply the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.380
<v Speaker 0>thing by u minus one to give us that u

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.440
<v Speaker 0>minus one b equals to a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.860
<v Speaker 0>Multiplying from the left by u minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.950
<v Speaker 0>Or this tells us that a equals to u minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:43.900
<v Speaker 0>one b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76]}

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.850
<v Speaker 0>So again we have that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:49.210
<v Speaker 0>Now we can get um we can write A as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.450
<v Speaker 0>an invertible matrix times B that looks okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:55.390
<v Speaker 0>The only thing that we have to think about is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:59.260
<v Speaker 0>we know that this u here um, u here was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:03.760
<v Speaker 0>a um, was a combination of um, a product of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.870
<v Speaker 0>elementary matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.290
<v Speaker 0>So this is e k times e2 times E1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,44,100,86]}

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:10.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so what is u minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is what I said earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, so u minus one obviously is this whole thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.280
<v Speaker 0>here, um, inverted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, and now we know how to get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.380
<v Speaker 0>We get that by just changing the order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.310
<v Speaker 0>So this is E one minus one times E two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 0>minus one and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.970
<v Speaker 0>Times e k minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:39.220
<v Speaker 0>Now um each of those here, um, it's the inverse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,93,54,100,100]}

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 0>of an elementary matrix Which we know is also an

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 0>elementary matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 0>So again, we can write a as a sequence of

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 0>elementary matrices applied to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,94]}

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 0>In other words we can get from B to a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 0>m.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 0>So to summarise that if we have something that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 0>say if it's something like this is symmetric, that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.550
<v Speaker 0>go from A to B and means we can get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 0>from B to A if and only if we call

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 0>this an equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86]}

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 0>And in this case we can say that two matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 0>A and B are row equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 0>If we go from A to B by elementary row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.380
<v Speaker 0>operations, and that implies we can also get vice versa

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 0>equivalences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 0>Again, not necessarily in this case, but equivalence is again

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54,52,100]}

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 0>is something that you will see a few times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 0>So to finish the whole thing off, I've got one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 0>last, um, last poll here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,73,100]}

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:43.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, which says that, um, I've got an n times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,47]}

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:44.780
<v Speaker 0>n matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, and which of these conditions that are half here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.290
<v Speaker 0>is now equivalent or is now equivalent to that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 0>The matrix A is invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 0>That is a bit of what we had last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, and a bit of what I've done just now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, this again will be a poll, um, where I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.590
<v Speaker 0>got multiple choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:13.400
<v Speaker 0>So I'll just set this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.950
<v Speaker 0>And it would have a choice this time or one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,47,99,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.780
<v Speaker 0>minute display now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 0>All.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 0>Ten more seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 0>We're not quite clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 0>B and D are the most favourite, but you're not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 0>sure, so let's look a, um, um, it's really equivalent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,82,93,100,93,100]}

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 0>to matrix and reduce alone form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,99,73,95]}

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.520
<v Speaker 0>That's not enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100]}

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.450
<v Speaker 0>Actually, every matrix is equivalent to a matrix in row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.320
<v Speaker 0>echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.130
<v Speaker 0>If it's an invertible matrix, it'll be actually be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,91,100,100,76]}

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.170
<v Speaker 0>It's equivalent to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.570
<v Speaker 0>So reduced form is not enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:57.510
<v Speaker 0>Um part C um it is an elementary matrix, while

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:03.030
<v Speaker 0>every elementary matrix is invertible, but not every invertible matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:04.200
<v Speaker 0>is elementary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.650
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, rather, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:10.410
<v Speaker 0>D is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, every elementary matrix is a every invertible matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.450
<v Speaker 0>a product of elementary matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.350
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, b I should say is correct as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.720
<v Speaker 0>Um B follows from what we have from the inverse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.880
<v Speaker 0>theorem we had in the last lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:29.490
<v Speaker 0>Uh, for every right hand side there is a solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.860
<v Speaker 0>And also we have been shown that this solution is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,57,100,100,57,100,100]}

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.370
<v Speaker 0>unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.800
<v Speaker 0>I just want to summarise this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.480
<v Speaker 0>just one more slide that says the last point that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.790
<v Speaker 0>we have out there, and a square matrix is invertible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,97,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.520
<v Speaker 0>if and only if it is the product of elementary

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.360
<v Speaker 0>matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.350
<v Speaker 0>So I've got a representation that I can write every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:50.750
<v Speaker 0>invertible matrices as a product there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.270
<v Speaker 0>And I like to think about this as the Lego

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.990
<v Speaker 0>theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.820
<v Speaker 0>It tells me indeed that every invertible matrix I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.960
<v Speaker 0>make up by using elementary matrices as my building blocks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.220
<v Speaker 0>I should add to this that this representation there are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 0>The product of elementary matrices is not unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.410
<v Speaker 0>There are several ones of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:16.640
<v Speaker 0>So this really works more like Legos again where you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.400
<v Speaker 0>can build something in various different ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, rather than say prime numbers where the product is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.050
<v Speaker 0>unique.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.830
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:25.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.330
<v Speaker 0>That's it for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 0>I'll see you tomorrow again, where we do something quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 0>different.
