00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to today's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 0>Uh, today we don't have attendance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 0>So this, uh, this QR code should take you straight

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 0>to the, um, exercise book club, and, uh, just let

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 0>me check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 0>The projector has shifted a bit, but hopefully the slides

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 0>are still visible there, so no harm in having it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, start logging in into the book club, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 0>But before we go there, uh, we need to finish

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 0>what we were doing yesterday because we had two statements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 0>that we left, uh, unfinished.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to go through that, and then we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 0>will start talking about eigenvalues and eigenspaces and eigenvalues, multiplicity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 0>and how they play into each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, you don't have the book club questions Students

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,98,98,100,78]}

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 0>today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 0>You've.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 0>You've had your chance to have a look at them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 0>yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, but let's pick it up where we left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[26,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 0>And I realised that I need also statement three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 0>So statement three in the last, uh, in the last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 0>exercise yesterday was the last thing we saw together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 0>And it asks to prove that if A is diagonalisable,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,90,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 0>then it's similar to its transposed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,73,100]}

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 0>And yesterday we saw that this was in fact true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 0>And we saw how to get it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 0>And the idea was, okay, let's start with the definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 0>of diagonal diagonalise ability, which essentially means that the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,81,81,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 0>is similar to the diagonalised version of it, the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 0>that is diagonal and has the eigenvector, the eigenvalues on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 0>the diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 0>And then we can invert that the relation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 0>And if we calculate the the diagonal matrix of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 0>transpose, we find that it can be written this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 0>P minus one t dt, which in which p and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 0>p minus one are the exact matrices that appear for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 0>the diagonalization of A, and then we notice that d

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,63]}

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 0>t is equal to d because transposing matrices leave the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 0>diagonal unchanged.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 0>And so from here we can then substitute this expression

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 0>here and reorganising, we see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 0>In fact we can find a new invertible matrix p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,81,100,100,89]}

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 0>p transposed, for which the similarity definition between 80 and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 0>A holds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 0>And we say okay, p t is invertible because if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,86,90,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 0>P is invertible, then its transpose is also invertible, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.350
<v Speaker 0>the product of two invertible matrices is itself and is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 0>itself invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 0>Now, why do I Uh, redo this, because the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 0>statement that we saw, well, that we didn't see yesterday,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 0>rather was that if A is Diagonalisable and B similar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 0>to A, then B has non-zero eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100]}

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 0>And the reason why I read it, number three is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,92,100,100,100]}

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 0>that this is also true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 0>And the proof is essentially exactly the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 0>We use different matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 0>We use different properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 0>But if you write it down, um, it looks and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 0>feels exactly like, uh, like like the proof before we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 0>start by, uh, the Diagonalisable definition, uh, a similar to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 0>it's diagonal form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100]}

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 0>D we invert that and then instead of of uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,54]}

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 0>plugging in this D into some, uh, into the, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,47,100,100,75]}

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 0>diagonalisable property for a transpose, we use, uh, the similarity,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.600
<v Speaker 0>uh, definition instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.950
<v Speaker 0>And then we can, uh, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,71]}

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.650
<v Speaker 0>We can do basically the same substitution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 0>And if we work, uh, again with the same way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 0>with the associativity and remembering, then taking the inverse of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 0>a product is like taking the product of the inverses

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.370
<v Speaker 0>in the opposite order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 0>We find something, um, that, uh, um, that show us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,98]}

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 0>that both A and B reduces to the same diagonal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 0>matrix D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.130
<v Speaker 0>And so because A had non-zero eigenvalue to begin with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 0>for hypothesis, then also B must follow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is the explicit proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 0>Um, we can also take a shortcut if we remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 0>theorem I think it was 5.5.1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.170
<v Speaker 0>I'm going by memory, but I think it was that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,98,97]}

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.670
<v Speaker 0>which says that, uh, if A similar to B, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 0>they have the same eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 0>And if it is diagonalisable, it has non-zero eigenvalues, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,58,100,100,96,100,62,100,100]}

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.430
<v Speaker 0>so b must have the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 0>And this is essentially how we build the proof for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 0>that theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 0>So going back to first principles rather than using one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.840
<v Speaker 0>of the results in your in your bit okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,46,100]}

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.140
<v Speaker 0>And then the last statement which was the only one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 0>that I marked read as the most difficult one, was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 0>that if a similar to B, then all powers of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 0>that is true for all integers positive or negative or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.910
<v Speaker 0>And the reason why I marked this red is not

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.290
<v Speaker 0>because it's a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52]}

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 0>The proof itself is particularly difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.480
<v Speaker 0>It's because of the first step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 0>You need an intuition that you can use the divide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 0>and conquer method that we that we talked about last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 0>week and here, how would you split the the big

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.880
<v Speaker 0>heart proof into smaller, simpler cases?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.140
<v Speaker 0>Any.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.710
<v Speaker 0>Anyone has any idea about how I can split this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.690
<v Speaker 0>into simpler things to check?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.960
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.440
<v Speaker 0>Precisely, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.270
<v Speaker 0>That is the natural thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.600
<v Speaker 0>So it turns out that this statement yesterday was true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.260
<v Speaker 0>And the key idea here is that we can split

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 0>an equal zero and positive and negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 0>And we it's good practice to start with the easiest

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.920
<v Speaker 0>one first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.800
<v Speaker 0>If n is equal zero then both matrices are the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.610
<v Speaker 0>identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.580
<v Speaker 0>Because a matrix raised to the zero power is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.270
<v Speaker 0>identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.020
<v Speaker 0>And and so it's done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 0>Then for the case uh n greater than zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.810
<v Speaker 0>There's a key observation that we really need to prove.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.530
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100]}

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.900
<v Speaker 0>This is a squared similar to b squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.800
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 0>And why is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 0>Well because if a similar to B then we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.370
<v Speaker 0>write B this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 0>And when we iterate b we write b squared as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.210
<v Speaker 0>b times p.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.060
<v Speaker 0>This becomes the product of this two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 0>And so by by regrouping p minus one p go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.340
<v Speaker 0>away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 0>And b square is similar to a squared through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.460
<v Speaker 0>same matrix P that allows you to move from A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 0>to B to begin with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 0>And so this shows that of course a squared is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.070
<v Speaker 0>similar to b squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.200
<v Speaker 0>And uh, if we can just redo everything with more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 0>uh with more multiplication of the same matrix, we will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.860
<v Speaker 0>get uh p minus one p in between every copy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.410
<v Speaker 0>of A on the right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 0>And so um, that shows it for all positive integers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Speaker 0>And what about negative integers?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Well, we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 0>The key observation for negative integers is that a to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.110
<v Speaker 0>the power of minus n can be written as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 0>inverse of a to the power of n, and uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,68]}

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 0>We know from an exercise and I'm sure you've seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.200
<v Speaker 0>this, is that if a similar to be their inverse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 0>are also similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 0>And so the case and less than zero or n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.880
<v Speaker 0>negative is exactly equal to the first part in which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.690
<v Speaker 0>you substitute b with its inverse and A with its

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 0>inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:36.400
<v Speaker 0>So again this exercise was marked as hard because not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 0>because the individual cases are particularly hard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 0>But if you try to approach it straight away for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.900
<v Speaker 0>any n uh then uh, you won't get you won't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,48,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.350
<v Speaker 0>get far because you can just prove it in one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 0>go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 0>I mean, there might be a way, but I, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.890
<v Speaker 0>can't, I can see it myself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:04.390
<v Speaker 0>So once again, standard, um, technique for proving things in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.020
<v Speaker 0>mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.100
<v Speaker 0>Divide and conquer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.830
<v Speaker 0>That was the point of this last part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Speaker 0>Question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.150
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any questions about any of these statements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.150
<v Speaker 0>that we left over from yesterday?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:21.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.340
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, this is the same slide as before, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.100
<v Speaker 0>now I'm highlighting what we do today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm sure you've, uh, you have seen all of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.550
<v Speaker 0>this in the readings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:43.240
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but before we start doing exercises, much like yesterday,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.020
<v Speaker 0>um, let's give out a couple of definitions that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 0>going to be very important in today's exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.360
<v Speaker 0>First is the multiplicity of an eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.140
<v Speaker 0>So if lambda is an eigenvalue of a matrix A,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:05.870
<v Speaker 0>its multiplicity is the the the algebraic multiplicity of lambda

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,72,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.240
<v Speaker 0>as a root of the characteristic polynomial okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.490
<v Speaker 0>So we've seen a theorem that the roots of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.920
<v Speaker 0>of the characteristic polynomials are the eigenvalues of the matrix,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 0>and that is the basis on which we can on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 0>which we perform our typical calculation to find eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 0>So to find the eigenvalues we solve the determinant of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.490
<v Speaker 0>a minus lambda I or x I minus a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 0>They're all equivalent formulation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,94,100,100]}

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.460
<v Speaker 0>And the reason why that works is precisely that theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.320
<v Speaker 0>Because the determinant of I minus a minus lambda I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.210
<v Speaker 0>is a method to write the characteristic polynomial of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.190

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 0>We set the determinant equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.660
<v Speaker 0>We solve and the roots are the eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.230
<v Speaker 0>And of course a polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.780
<v Speaker 0>You are all familiar with the number of solutions or

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 0>the multiplicity rather of the solutions of a polynomial, something

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.560
<v Speaker 0>that looks, for example, like uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.070
<v Speaker 0>X minus a times x minus b uh equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,69,100]}

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 0>Those both x will be equal to a and b,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.760
<v Speaker 0>and both will have multiplicity one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.790
<v Speaker 0>And the multiplicity increase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68]}

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 0>If we have something like this now b now A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,72,97,86]}

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.390
<v Speaker 0>has multiplicity equal to okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100]}

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.340
<v Speaker 0>And we've seen that this factor is connected to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.870
<v Speaker 0>fact that the characteristic polynomial factors completely and factors completely

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 0>means that it can be written all in this form

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 0>here of, uh, a succession of product of simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,45,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.970
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.280
<v Speaker 0>And just to be extra, extra clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.420
<v Speaker 0>Raising this to some power is allowed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.090
<v Speaker 0>This is still completely factored.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.070
<v Speaker 0>What is not allowed is to have terms that do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.070
<v Speaker 0>not factors, uh, any further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100]}

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.840
<v Speaker 0>So for example x squared plus one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.830
<v Speaker 0>This is not allowed if, if the characteristic polynomial has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.620
<v Speaker 0>any of these type of terms that you can't reduce

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,90,100,58,100]}

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.930
<v Speaker 0>any further into terms in which the x has power

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.890
<v Speaker 0>one, then the characteristic polynomial does not factor completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.360
<v Speaker 0>And then we've seen a theorem that uh states that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.930
<v Speaker 0>if, uh, the characteristic polynomial factor is completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.420
<v Speaker 0>We have two equivalent to equivalent properties a being diagonalisable

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 0>and the dimension of the eigenspaces associated to each eigenvalue

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.600
<v Speaker 0>being equal to the algebraic multiplicity of that eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so it's an if and only if if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.020
<v Speaker 0>have something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.330
<v Speaker 0>That theorem is not true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.370
<v Speaker 0>And we will see an example okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,81]}

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:18.360
<v Speaker 0>It is required to have uh, uh, a completely, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.290
<v Speaker 0>a completely factorised characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 0>Uh, by the way, if the characteristic polynomial is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.450
<v Speaker 0>completely factorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.490
<v Speaker 0>Is the matrix invertible or not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.900
<v Speaker 0>If the if the characteristic polynomial is in this form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 0>Here, together with this, uh, with this factor here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.900
<v Speaker 0>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 0>Can we find the diagonal form of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay, we will see it later, but spoiler alert.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 0>No, because we don't find enough eigenvalues to, uh, to,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 0>um, to to diagonalise the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.850
<v Speaker 0>We will see all of this in the following two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 0>exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 0>So the first one is just, uh, to do something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 0>that is slightly different than usual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 0>Instead of like, doing both true and false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 0>I've created a matching exercise, uh, of logical implications.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 0>So on the left hand side, you have the hypothesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,99]}

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 0>And on the right hand side you have thesis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 0>And then for some reason, this math bit didn't pick

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:34.750
<v Speaker 0>up this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 0>This should be lambda.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then, um, yeah, it's your job to match

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.860
<v Speaker 0>the numbers with the letters And as usual with these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 0>things, there might be multiple that are allowed and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,83,100,100]}

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.220
<v Speaker 0>will go through them together in a couple of minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 0>So discuss with your neighbours why you think some are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.480
<v Speaker 0>better than others as matches between the left and the

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.140
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.740
<v Speaker 0>And we'll pick it up in a couple of minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.560
<v Speaker 0>I have, uh, approximately 30 answers so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 0>If you can, uh, submit your answers now, we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 0>to check them very quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 0>But in the meantime, without giving too much away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 0>Just a reminder of three results that we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 0>use to solve these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 0>These are three theorem that I lifted straight from your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 0>reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 0>Straight from part uh 5.5 of the of the book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, essay is diagonalisable if and only if, uh, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,38,100,100,100,100,100,100,47,97]}

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 0>the eigenvectors spun around and uh, when, uh, when both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 0>conditions, both equivalent conditions are satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 0>So A is the is Diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,100,100]}

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 0>Then if the matrix P is invertible, there exists, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 0>Uh, sorry, there exists one matrix B, which is invertible,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,87,100,100,47,100,100,100]}

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 0>and it's exactly the matrix of the eigenvectors put by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 0>columns such that the matrix returns through similarity the diagonalised

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 0>version of a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's the first result that that we use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 0>The second one is that if VN are the eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 0>uh with corresponding um eigenvalues lambda one, lambda two, lambda

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 0>n all distinct, uh, then uh, the set of the

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors is a linearly independent set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 0>And here another type of pair.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,58]}

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 0>It should be a backslash that makes em both mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,100,100]}

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 0>And finally, um, if uh which is really a consequence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 0>of the previous two, if, uh, a matrix are n

<v Speaker 0>That is the second theorem, together with the first part

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.030

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.370
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's have a look at some of these statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.020
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.760
<v Speaker 0>If A is Diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 0>Well, actually, let's have a look at the the answer

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.520
<v Speaker 0>that you submitted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.440
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, if A is diagonalisable in case of X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.820
<v Speaker 0>factor is completely, then the dimension of the eigenspace is

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.370
<v Speaker 0>equal to the multiplicity for all lambdas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.510
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:16.420
<v Speaker 0>That was the first theorem that we saw earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.440
<v Speaker 0>If A is triangular upper lower than the eigenvalues are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.780

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 0>Yes absolutely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.620
<v Speaker 0>And let's do the first three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.600
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to go through them a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.980
<v Speaker 0>bit more systematically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.610
<v Speaker 0>And if we can factor out a factor x minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.030
<v Speaker 0>lambda to the power of n, then the then lambda

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.830
<v Speaker 0>will be an eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90]}

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.620
<v Speaker 0>Because setting x equal lambda makes the characteristic polynomial zero,

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.470

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.160

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's uh, give some more constructive proof rather

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 0>than say, uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100]}

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 0>It's just, uh, that that statement is uh, is obviously

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 0>true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 0>Let's start with the triangular matrix result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 0>Why are the eigenvalues equal to the diagonal entries?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, well, we can we can write down the eigenvalues

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 0>as the roots of the characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 0>Nothing nothing new here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 0>And now we want to notice something that if A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.600

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Speaker 0>It's also triangular because when we take the matrix A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.350
<v Speaker 0>minus x that we use to calculate the characteristic polynomial,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.090
<v Speaker 0>and the only elements that are modified are the diagonal

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.800
<v Speaker 0>ones, the ones that are on the diagonal gets a

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.060
<v Speaker 0>minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:59.270
<v Speaker 0>Component after them, and all other elements of the matrix

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.980

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.820
<v Speaker 0>So the resulting matrix of which we're calculating the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,51,100,100,100]}

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.890
<v Speaker 0>is also triangular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.370
<v Speaker 0>And we've seen in week four that a determinant of

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:17.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.110
<v Speaker 0>So uh, I'm not sure you've seen this symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.630
<v Speaker 0>If you haven't, this is a good time to grow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is just like the sigma for the sum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.030
<v Speaker 0>where you sum all the terms, uh, the at various

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Speaker 0>values for I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.990
<v Speaker 0>So if you have, uh, the sum over, I equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.880
<v Speaker 0>one n of x I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.470
<v Speaker 0>This is x one plus x two plus six, three,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100]}

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.170
<v Speaker 0>six, four and so on and so forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.800
<v Speaker 0>This symbol here works exactly the same way, but instead

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.160
<v Speaker 0>of having a sum, this is the Greek letter sigma.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.270
<v Speaker 0>For some this is the letter the Greek letter capital

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.770
<v Speaker 0>pi for product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:07.010
<v Speaker 0>So this would be x one times x two times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.390

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.860
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm writing there is just that the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.350
<v Speaker 0>is the product of all the of the diagonal elements

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.950
<v Speaker 0>of the matrices of the matrix, which are the I

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.570
<v Speaker 0>minus one times x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100]}

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.210
<v Speaker 0>Coming from the fact that I've subtracted the identity times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.630
<v Speaker 0>x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what are the eigenvalues?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.090
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry, what are the roots of this polynomial?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[31,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 0>Well, all the roots of this polynomial are exactly the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.900
<v Speaker 0>A's, because if x is equal to one of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.400
<v Speaker 0>A's, it would cancel out one of these factors here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.930
<v Speaker 0>which are written this way here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.710
<v Speaker 0>And the whole polynomial would be would be easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so the roots of the of the characteristic polynomial

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.390
<v Speaker 0>are exactly the diagonal entries of A, and therefore the

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.660
<v Speaker 0>diagonal entries are the eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.300
<v Speaker 0>So this is a bit more constructive than what we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.050
<v Speaker 0>done before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.290
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.540
<v Speaker 0>Therefore the eigenvalues are lambda equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.240
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:27.720
<v Speaker 0>Next up there was uh a uh a statement that

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.530
<v Speaker 0>Which was if the eigenvectors Vectors span.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:36.450
<v Speaker 0>If the span of the eigenvector is a proper subset

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.300
<v Speaker 0>Then a singular um.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.710
<v Speaker 0>Correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.000

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.160
<v Speaker 0>being diagonalisable it means that the determinant is zero.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.320
<v Speaker 0>And so this is just, uh, uh, negation of the

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.010

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.850
<v Speaker 0>that if A is diagonalisable, then the eigenvectors span the

<v Speaker 0>entire RN.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.170

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.410
<v Speaker 0>And so it's it's not invertible.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.160

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.290

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh no.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.820
<v Speaker 0>There's, there's a couple more, actually.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.200
<v Speaker 0>and then then of course, uh, the oh it was,

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.610
<v Speaker 0>it was right here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.210
<v Speaker 0>And then the multiplicity of lambda is n oh that

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:52.390
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.790
<v Speaker 0>And then I thought that was A0I misread.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.290
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is just the definition of multiplicity, right.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:28.330
<v Speaker 0>And if A is diagonalisable in k factors completely, then

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.000

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:56.620
<v Speaker 0>perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.150
<v Speaker 0>This is an equivalent condition for not being diagonalisable, hence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:05.560
<v Speaker 0>So both of these uh, matching are are fine.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.110
<v Speaker 0>I just picked another one.

<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.140
<v Speaker 0>I think it was, uh.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.550
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's a touch screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,94]}

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.070
<v Speaker 0>Uh, for, for for the dimension of the eigenspace to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,88,98,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.330
<v Speaker 0>be two you need to independent eigenvectors corresponding to that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:45.840
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.150
<v Speaker 0>Two linearly independent ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:52.050
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise the span of that eigenvalue of that eigenvector can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.220
<v Speaker 0>never be more than one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.120
<v Speaker 0>If you only have one vector as a basis of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.410
<v Speaker 0>that subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.360
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:15.240
<v Speaker 0>So um, next up, um, question two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.880
<v Speaker 0>This one I couldn't I couldn't turn it into anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.150
<v Speaker 0>else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.570
<v Speaker 0>So this is a good old true and false four

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50]}

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.530
<v Speaker 0>statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:30.660
<v Speaker 0>I didn't classify them in hard and non hard, although

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.880
<v Speaker 0>the last one is the one that's a little bit,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:38.550
<v Speaker 0>um, a little bit more interesting perhaps just because, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 0>you probably haven't seen this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.560
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the other ones are applications of what we've seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:44.910
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.840
<v Speaker 0>Five more minutes to walk, to work through, um, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 0>ones that you, um, that you feel comfortable with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.370
<v Speaker 0>And then, um, then we're going to go over them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,71,64,64,100,100,100]}

00:31:59.370 --> 00:31:59.970
<v Speaker 0>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I have almost 50 answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.960
<v Speaker 0>If you submit them, we can start going through them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.429
<v Speaker 0>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 0>Let's see the first one for which you're mostly confident

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:08.390
<v Speaker 0>that it's true, but I have purposefully omitted a condition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,87,100,88,100]}

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.190
<v Speaker 0>You don't know that the characteristic polynomial factor is completely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,72,72,100]}

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.680
<v Speaker 0>for that matrix, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 0>That is an equivalency only if the characteristic polynomial factors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.070
<v Speaker 0>completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 0>And for that reason why we can produce a counterexample

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 0>to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 0>We can produce a matrix for which the dimension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.030
<v Speaker 0>the eigenspace is equal to the multiplicity for all eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.700
<v Speaker 0>But we're missing out on eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.980
<v Speaker 0>And so the matrix is not diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.820
<v Speaker 0>So that was one of the points that I was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:48.440
<v Speaker 0>really hoping to make during this, uh, during this lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:54.830
<v Speaker 0>And again, the catch must factor completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.440
<v Speaker 0>And we can have this counterexample here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.510
<v Speaker 0>If you write down the determinant of that matrix, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:08.270
<v Speaker 0>get, uh, uh, this, uh, this expression here and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:14.360
<v Speaker 0>characteristic polynomial only has uh, one root which is uh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.890
<v Speaker 0>x equal one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100]}

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 0>And you do that by putting x minus on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 0>on the diagonal and expanding over the third row, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 0>get x minus one and then x squared plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 0>So this matrix here in principle satisfy the right hand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 0>side condition here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 0>The dimension of the eigenspace we will check has multiplicity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.170
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:46.470
<v Speaker 0>But because it doesn't have a full set of eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.210
<v Speaker 0>corresponding to our spanning R3, it won't be, um, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.020
<v Speaker 0>won't be, um, won't be diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.830
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the eigenspace corresponding to that eigenvalue is spanned by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.880
<v Speaker 0>this vector here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.860
<v Speaker 0>And so the dimension is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 0>And note that this is an if and only if.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 0>For this to be true we must be able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 0>suppose that if if the dimension equals the multiplicity of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 0>lambda, then a is diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any question about this question here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 0>Because because the next remark is a consequence but mostly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 0>unrelated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.420
<v Speaker 0>So this would be a good time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Speaker 0>Well in that case let's have a look at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 0>characteristic polynomial once again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh what is what does it mean to factor completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.090
<v Speaker 0>Well I've written it down earlier, but um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78]}

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.540
<v Speaker 0>It, it you can rephrase that as meaning that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 0>sum of the multiplicity of the eigenvalues are equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 0>the matrix dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.820
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, and let's see why very quickly, if it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 0>factors completely, we know that we can, uh, that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100]}

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 0>can write it as a product of first order terms

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.310
<v Speaker 0>raised to some powers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,99,100]}

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 0>And of course lambda one to lambda m will be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.320
<v Speaker 0>our eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.020
<v Speaker 0>And because the characteristic polynomial has degree equal to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.130
<v Speaker 0>dimension of the matrix, we know that the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.460
<v Speaker 0>all these n's and one plus n two plus n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 0>that must be less than or equal to n, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.950
<v Speaker 0>Because if there are some was greater than end and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 0>this would be an n plus something degree polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 0>And that's not possible because the characteristic polynomial is at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 0>most the dimension of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 0>So we really have only two options.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 0>And if it's smaller than n then it means that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 0>there's that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,82]}

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 0>We're missing some factor here, because the degree of the

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.210

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.670

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 0>the degree of the polynomial on the right hand side

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 0>on the left hand side, sorry, is n because it's

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 0>the characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.250
<v Speaker 0>And so we're missing one of those factors in the

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 0>Because if if the remaining degrees on the right hand

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.090

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 0>it would be in this in this form already it

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.610

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 0>But it's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.110
<v Speaker 0>So I'm missing out on on an factor that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,63,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.780

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.170
<v Speaker 0>And so the fact that the, the, the sum of

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.470
<v Speaker 0>the multiplicity of the eigenvalues is strictly less than the

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.050
<v Speaker 0>size of the matrix implies that I'm, I'm leaving out

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 0>one of those factors that prevents me to factor completely

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 0>the polynomial, and vice versa.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100]}

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.820
<v Speaker 0>If n one N1 plus n2 plus n m already

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.230
<v Speaker 0>give me a polynomial of degree n, then I can't

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.490
<v Speaker 0>have any more factor that can create me problem with

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:29.330
<v Speaker 0>Because the factors that I have already written in already

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.810

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I put this remark here mostly because, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:45.110
<v Speaker 0>it's uh, something that uh, I use to build that,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.030
<v Speaker 0>uh, counterexample to number one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:51.920
<v Speaker 0>It's a counterexample I've built by selecting a matrix that

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.980

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.510
<v Speaker 0>factorising term, and exploiting the fact that the multiplicity doesn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.720
<v Speaker 0>add up to the dimension of the space in which

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.620
<v Speaker 0>the matrix acts, which in our example here was of

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.760
<v Speaker 0>course R3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.120
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.260
<v Speaker 2>So that first one, if you just added the characteristic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,84,88,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.780
<v Speaker 2>polynomial factorises completely, it would be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:19.940
<v Speaker 0>It's a it's a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,95,100,100]}

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.310
<v Speaker 0>If you go back and read the theorem we had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.720
<v Speaker 0>it in the previous slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.960
<v Speaker 0>The theorem goes like um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:31.910
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.170
<v Speaker 0>Can find it now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 0>Oh yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 0>There it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 0>The following are equivalent for a square matrix for which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 0>the characteristic polynomial k of x factor is completely right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 0>So if you add that then you can prove it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 0>this by looking at this uh theorem which again I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 0>lifted straight from the writing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 0>So it's in section 5.5 somewhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 0>But here I didn't include it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.710
<v Speaker 0>And so I could build I could build the counterexample

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,97]}

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.280
<v Speaker 0>that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh, where were we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 0>This is still question one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 0>Question two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:08.780
<v Speaker 0>Remark.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:14.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay Number two, if the eigenvectors of a, uh, error

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,33]}

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.990
<v Speaker 0>are n times n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 0>Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.550
<v Speaker 0>Spun our n, so do the ones of a minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,33,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.210
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, you're pretty much okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.850
<v Speaker 0>There's there's a tendency towards being this being true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.470
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we're going to do a raise of hands for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.250
<v Speaker 0>number three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.530
<v Speaker 0>This is indeed true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.790
<v Speaker 0>Uh, why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,92]}

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:41.940
<v Speaker 0>Well, um, let's pick the eigenvalues of A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:46.380
<v Speaker 0>We know that they span RN, and for all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,21,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:52.200
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors, we get this equation here, which, um, uh, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.540
<v Speaker 0>can multiply by a minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:58.710
<v Speaker 0>Uh, again, if I give you a minus one in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:03.150
<v Speaker 0>the in the hypothesis, it's, uh, it's implied that A's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,74,100,73]}

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.650
<v Speaker 0>is diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 0>And it's also implied by the fact that the eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.290
<v Speaker 0>span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.130
<v Speaker 0>So um, we can multiply by a minus one, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.670
<v Speaker 0>exist, and we get, uh, what do we get?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.790
<v Speaker 0>We get a minus one A on one side and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.930
<v Speaker 0>lambda a minus one v, I can simplify a minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 0>one a on one side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.360
<v Speaker 0>Divide by lambda and I get a swap sides here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,77,77,100,100]}

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.780
<v Speaker 0>This this used to be this part here multiplied by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 0>a minus one on the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.290
<v Speaker 0>And I also divide it by lambda.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:38.880
<v Speaker 0>So here what I'm left is a minus one lambda

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.430
<v Speaker 0>divided by lambda goes away v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.690
<v Speaker 0>So a minus one v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.840
<v Speaker 0>And here I have a minus one a goes away

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.960

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.380

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:09.160

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.870
<v Speaker 0>So it is not true that the polynomial p of

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.100

<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:28.190
<v Speaker 0>Yes, because we're working with the real numbers on in

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.000
<v Speaker 0>this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.630

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.300
<v Speaker 0>that we're not treating in this course that now if

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.140
<v Speaker 0>you allow the elements of the matrices and the eigenvalues,

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 0>the eigenvalues of the matrices to be complex number, you

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:48.530

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.910

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.730
<v Speaker 0>And there's actually something called the fundamental theorem of algebra

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:00.530
<v Speaker 0>that says that a polynomial of degree n has roots.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.200
<v Speaker 0>And all of these problems go away.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.390
<v Speaker 0>But these problems are created by the fact that we're

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.960

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 0>And this is also why the section on complex number

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.760

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.160

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:23.000

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.080
<v Speaker 0>in some applications.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.320
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.810
<v Speaker 0>So it's also useful content mathematically creates problem.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.970
<v Speaker 0>It's more elegant to go to complex numbers.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.380
<v Speaker 0>But in some in some application it's a limitation you

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.810

<v Speaker 0>Anything else.

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.450

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.720

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:07.470

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.260

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:10.980
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,91]}

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody argue about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,71,95,95,57]}

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.390
<v Unknown>And see like the characteristic polynomial factors completely.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Does that right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,80,100]}

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Like does that tell you anything about how diagonalisable the

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.970

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.930
<v Speaker 0>But I'll think about it because I'm not 100% sure

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.520

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.900
<v Speaker 0>what you're sure, most sure and least sure about because,

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:03.810
<v Speaker 0>So another one in which most of you got this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.470
<v Speaker 0>wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:08.580
<v Speaker 0>And the proof here is fairly simple in the fact

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.060
<v Speaker 0>that you can write the definition of eigenvector of A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.660
<v Speaker 0>like this, and you can prove that the same eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.380
<v Speaker 0>of A will also be eigenvectors of A plus I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99,95]}

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.920
<v Speaker 0>with eigenvalue lambda plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:23.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:29.130
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and that comes basically because uh, all vectors are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100]}

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.300
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors of the identity matrix because they get transformed to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:33.660
<v Speaker 0>itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.280
<v Speaker 0>Ta ta ta themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,68,68,100]}

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:38.370
<v Speaker 0>So v is eigenvector of a plus one with eigenvalue

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:39.450
<v Speaker 0>lambda plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 0>And so they have the same sets of eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:48.090
<v Speaker 0>And because the first set spanned r n then the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,48,89,100,100]}

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.600
<v Speaker 0>other set which is the same set will also span

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.070
<v Speaker 0>the same one as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:53.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.880
<v Speaker 0>So the last bit is this can take a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.700
<v Speaker 0>bit longer, but I'm going to leave it open until

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.530
<v Speaker 0>the over the end of the lesson so it can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,41,100]}

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.340
<v Speaker 0>have a chance of, uh, of doing this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is just, uh, it's a 1 to 4.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,69,100,100,98,98,98]}

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.650
<v Speaker 0>Four means that you're very confident in doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 0>Um, and one means you're not at all confident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.230
<v Speaker 0>And, um, as you can see, this only covers the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,78]}

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:24.640
<v Speaker 0>some topics from my week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.460
<v Speaker 0>So week for week eight and week nine because it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.780
<v Speaker 0>was responsible for those weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72]}

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.780
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to send uh that data through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.120
<v Speaker 0>So very important that you get this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.800
<v Speaker 0>And I'm just going to cover.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.890
<v Speaker 0>So you're, uh, completely anonymous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100]}

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.230
<v Speaker 0>And other than that, it's 1 p.m..

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,93]}

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:42.280
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for coming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.560
<v Speaker 0>And I'll see you all at the tutorials.
