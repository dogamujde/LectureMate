00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 0>We have the red light to go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 0>So it's Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100]}

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 0>Your numbers have decreased further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 0>Maybe this is unsurprising for a Friday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yesterday we looked at eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 0>While we looked at the definition of an eigenvalue and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 0>an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100]}

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 0>Today is all about actually finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 0>So at the end of yesterday we just reached the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 0>point where we saw.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 0>To calculate an eigenvalue you essentially have to solve this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 0>equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 0>So lambda times the identity um minus whatever matrix you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 0>want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 0>And you find the determine to that you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 0>make it equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,67,100]}

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 0>So in order to get going today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.519
<v Speaker 0>Here is a first question to warm us all up.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 0>Get our brains working for Friday lunchtime.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 0>There is a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 0>What are the eigenvalues of the matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I will give you the hint that they are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 0>all between the values of one 0 to 5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what do I want to do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 0>That's what I want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 0>They are all between 0 and 5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,67,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 0>They shouldn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 0>Actually, this is quite a nice matrix to find the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 0>determinant of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully shouldn't be too bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not going to give you too long but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 0>just to warm up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 0>What are the eigenvalues for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 0>Is that a hand up.

<v Speaker 0>Know something at the corner of my eye okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to have a chat with your friend.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 0>We essentially want to find this determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 0>Let's think about what that means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.430
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully this isn't too bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 0>Oh, we've reached a third of voters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,98,94,99]}

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 0>Then we seem to have stalled.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.790

<v Speaker 0>We seem quite happy there, actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 0>Lots of people voting.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 0>And magically, it's all going to appear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.090
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we all seem fairly happy that it is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 0>one, 2 or 5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 0>Well done everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 0>It's one, two and five.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 0>Yay!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 0>We have a brain even though it's a Friday.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully we all kind of got to something like

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.940
<v Speaker 0>And then we think about the term to this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 0>We can expand along the first column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 0>And then so it's lambda minus one times the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.310
<v Speaker 0>of this two by two which relatively clearly hopefully should

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.650
<v Speaker 0>be lambda minus two lambda minus five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 0>And that all equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100]}

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.299
<v Speaker 0>So our three roots are one, two and five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.880

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.380
<v Speaker 0>we're all asleep, so if I'm energetic, maybe that will

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.980
<v Speaker 0>pass on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 0>The downside of this is I will crash halfway through

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.890
<v Speaker 0>the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.740

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Speaker 0>So how do we actually find eigenvalues?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.150
<v Speaker 0>It turns out you find eigenvalues by casting your mind

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.040

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 0>Friday when we were solving systems of equations.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, everyone's favourite thing to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 0>Well, that's what we're doing again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yay!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 0>So wonderful calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 0>To kick off our Friday, let us find the eigen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,97,100,100]}

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 0>So each eigenvalue is going to have a different eigenvector

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 0>because that kind of follows from the definition.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 0>So we need to do to find the eigenvectors of

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 0>this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 0>That's the word we're going to have to do three

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 0>somewhat long calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 0>Um so let us start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 0>We're going to look at our first eigenvalue lambda equals

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 0>one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 0>So we want to consider the matrix one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 0>There's a secret one there that we don't write because

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 0>it's one minus a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 0>And if we think about what that matrix is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 0>If we're expecting like two, wonderful.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 0>We expect at least one free verbal.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 0>If we have a line, we expect a free verbal.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.700

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we've discussed this briefly yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,40,39,100,100,100]}

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes you have lambda times the identity minus a, sometimes

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.630
<v Speaker 0>you have a minus lambda times the identity.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 0>If you do it this way, the identity minus A,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.130
<v Speaker 0>you end up with a lot of negative signs generally.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 0>So it's worth just let's times everything by minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.650

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.570
<v Speaker 0>We've changed everything by minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.310
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.420
<v Speaker 0>Let's then do a bit of row reduction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to start by swapping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.680
<v Speaker 0>Which two shall I swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100]}

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 0>First and second.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.150

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.160

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 0>One last step maybe.

<v Speaker 1>Yes, yes.

<v Speaker 0>We're all right.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.740
<v Speaker 0>It's a Friday.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it doesn't matter, frankly, because it's a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.910
<v Speaker 0>I care a lot about the direction.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 0>I don't really care the magnitude of this line.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:29.800
<v Speaker 0>So yes 100 is an eigenvector but so is 200.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.560
<v Speaker 0>So is -2020 400.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100]}

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.830
<v Speaker 0>So is pick your favourite number zero zero.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.870

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 0>that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.420

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.230
<v Speaker 0>So that was our first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.770

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.900

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.220
<v Speaker 0>But I am going to do two because something special

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.070

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.940
<v Speaker 0>Let's learn to multiply by four.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.440
<v Speaker 0>Let's get rid of the fractions where possible.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:37.540
<v Speaker 0>Are we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Still.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.760
<v Speaker 0>All good?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.340
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to do the last one.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.170
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to leave that one to you.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.940
<v Speaker 0>I will give you the answer and let you double

<v Speaker 0>check this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.490
<v Speaker 0>But lambda equals five is the last one.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, and you should end up with your third eigenvalue

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.730

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.620

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.820
<v Speaker 0>But there you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.400
<v Speaker 0>Are we all happy with how to find eigenvectors?

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.660
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.560
<v Speaker 0>It's slightly long winded, but not actually too hot.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.530
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's the same method you've been using for five

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.290
<v Speaker 0>weeks now, um, in various different guises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.030
<v Speaker 0>So hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.950
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.290
<v Speaker 0>So that is how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.180
<v Speaker 0>So that's all good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 0>Um what if though.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.360
<v Speaker 0>So that was quite nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.600
<v Speaker 0>I had two I had three eigenvectors and I had

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.920
<v Speaker 0>three eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 0>What if when we find our characteristic polynomial, though, we

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.670
<v Speaker 0>end up with a double root?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 0>What do we think could happen then?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 0>So let's think about another matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.470

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,99]}

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 0>stuff up a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 0>Let's think about this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 0>What are the eigenvalues there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 0>If we just yell at me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 0>One zero and one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 0>But if we think about the characteristic polynomial, it's actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.500

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 0>So we've only got two roots but we've kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,94]}

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 0>got three eigenvalues because lambda is a repeated eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.459
<v Speaker 0>So what's happening here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 0>What do people think's going to happen when we find

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.430
<v Speaker 0>So let's just consider I mean finding the eigenvectors for

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.960

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.720
<v Speaker 0>Let's consider the eigenvectors for one.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.080
<v Speaker 0>If we do the identity minus this matrix, we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.110
<v Speaker 0>to end up with minus one, minus seven plus 17

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.370

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.780
<v Speaker 0>What ranks that matrix one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,91,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 0>So how many free free variables do we have.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.470
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.190
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.390
<v Speaker 0>So we could times everything by minus one to make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.220
<v Speaker 0>this nice and quickly solve it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.030
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to get y equals one free variable

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.770
<v Speaker 0>z equals another free variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.840
<v Speaker 0>And x is going to be 17.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.090

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.600
<v Speaker 0>And if we solve this I appreciate I'm doing this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.130
<v Speaker 0>relatively quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:31.450
<v Speaker 0>We're going to have 17 one zero plus zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.130
<v Speaker 0>Minus eight zero one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 0>So we now have two basic solutions, and both of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 0>them are eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:55.020
<v Speaker 0>So in this case we actually have two eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 0>So this is quite funky.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 0>We so we did the algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 0>We found two roots.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.790
<v Speaker 0>This is known as the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 0>So yeah every eigenvalue has a corresponding eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 0>And if you find a double root when you're doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.880
<v Speaker 0>your determinant that is known as the algebraic multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.940
<v Speaker 0>If you find a triple root it's got multiplicity three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 0>So it's how much when you do the all the

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 0>algebra how often does your root appear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 0>That's known as the algebraic multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 0>But let's start thinking geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,95,100,100]}

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 0>We like thinking geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.960
<v Speaker 0>What is happening geometrically when I have got two eigenvalues?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,73,73,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you get it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,99,91]}

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.130
<v Speaker 0>I get a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.380
<v Speaker 0>So instead of having a fixed line, instead of a

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.140
<v Speaker 0>line being mapped to itself, I've now got a whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.000
<v Speaker 0>So you can think about it as a reflection in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 0>3D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.030
<v Speaker 0>That mirror gets reflected to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.470
<v Speaker 0>So the eigenvalues of that mirror, well they're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.340
<v Speaker 0>So that mirror gets mapped entirely to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.440
<v Speaker 0>And we get a fixed plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.340
<v Speaker 0>And that is the geometric multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.860
<v Speaker 0>So how many eigenvectors you get for your algebraic multiplicity

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.010
<v Speaker 0>is your geometric multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.030
<v Speaker 0>Does that make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.830
<v Speaker 0>So you have the algebra that gives you how many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.480
<v Speaker 0>times an eigenvalue appears.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,91]}

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.570
<v Speaker 0>And then for every eigenvalue you have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Different.

<v Speaker 0>Number of eigenvectors that can appear.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.410
<v Speaker 0>And that's your geometric multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.620
<v Speaker 0>So far, so happy still?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.580
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.050
<v Speaker 1>So the transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Applied by matrix B it's reflecting it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,86,97,100,100,52]}

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 0>So this one um yeah actually this one, this one's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,80]}

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 0>not a reflection because we've got eigenvalue zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 0>So if it was a reflection you'd only have eigenvalues

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 0>one and minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100]}

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 0>That's what we saw yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 0>But here we've got a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 0>So the plane spanned by these two vectors a plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,36,100]}

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:08.620
<v Speaker 0>Anything that can be written like this, um is fixed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 0>by this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 0>And then everything that's not on that plane is kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 0>of where it's got eigenvalue zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,96,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 0>So that's getting what happens if you have eigenvalue zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 0>actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 0>Let's go back to the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 0>What happens if your eigenvalue zero you will get mapped

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 0>to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.080
<v Speaker 0>So you get pushed down to everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,58]}

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.620
<v Speaker 0>So actually if we think about this a bit, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.070
<v Speaker 0>matrix here, it's got a plane that's being fixed and

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.900
<v Speaker 0>everything else is being mapped to the origin.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.720
<v Speaker 0>So it's kind of collapsing everything just down to the

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.170
<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.600
<v Speaker 1>So for each.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Line that was presented by those two classic solutions, we

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.900
<v Speaker 2>think of the map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.170
<v Unknown>To itself and very linear combination which is represented by

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.950
<v Unknown>the plane as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.200
<v Unknown>So it's going to also be mapped to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,93,98,97]}

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.620
<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 0>Because even if I have say if I have three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.580

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.770
<v Speaker 0>well three lots of that vector is getting mapped to

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.820
<v Speaker 0>three lots of that vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.200
<v Speaker 0>And two lots of that one is getting mapped to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,54,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.800
<v Speaker 0>that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.380
<v Speaker 0>And we know linear transformation is respect addition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,76,72,100,98]}

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.540
<v Speaker 0>So it's still going to be those three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.980

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.710
<v Speaker 0>So we get exactly the plane gets exactly mapped to

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.310

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 0>But actually that's quite good if we think about what

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.870
<v Speaker 0>we just did there geometrically, just by looking at the

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:43.280
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we could tell what that matrix did

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Speaker 0>geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.670
<v Speaker 0>I can't look at that matrix off the top of

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:52.010
<v Speaker 0>my head and go, that is pushing everything is observing

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.040

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 0>But we can do that with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 0>That is, the power of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.590
<v Speaker 0>They allow us to do the geometry without doing any

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.150

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.140
<v Speaker 0>draw things.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:16.130
<v Speaker 0>So we know if the eigenvalue has an eigenvector.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.270
<v Speaker 0>So how does the algebraic multiplicity and the geometric multiplicity

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.990
<v Speaker 0>relate to each other?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Which one's got to be bigger than the other one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 0>The outbreaks got to be bigger because for every algebraic

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.870

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Hang on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.130
<v Speaker 0>I said that completely backwards and all that.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 0>You can't have more eigenvectors than you do.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.820
<v Speaker 0>The number of eigenvalues, each eigenvalue even repeated, only gives

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.100

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.230
<v Speaker 0>So we know that the algebraic multiplicity is bigger than

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.610

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.110
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.850
<v Speaker 0>So we actually have this inequality.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.580

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 0>Because if you have one eigenvalue, you have a eigenvector

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:08.800
<v Speaker 0>by definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.140
<v Speaker 0>If you do not have an eigenvector, then you're not

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.380
<v Speaker 0>You have at least one eigenvector, but you don't have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.300
<v Speaker 0>So this we will see it in a bit a

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.670

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.400

<v Speaker 0>Even though the eigenvalue appears twice.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.840
<v Speaker 0>I feel like we kind of went boring calculation boring

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.220
<v Speaker 0>calculation calculation hard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,39]}

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.470
<v Speaker 0>But the theory we're about to go back to born

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.070
<v Speaker 0>calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 0>But does anyone have questions about the spiking theory?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,97]}

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Let me get back to finish.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,58,77,62,98,87]}

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41]}

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46]}

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:02.940
<v Speaker 0>It.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:03.570
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:09.150
<v Speaker 0>So we got two eigenvectors because our eigenvalue appeared twice,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.100
<v Speaker 0>but it's not always the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.510
<v Speaker 0>Even if your eigenvalue appears multiple times, that doesn't guarantees

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 0>you one eigenvector, but it doesn't guarantee you two eigenvectors

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.300
<v Speaker 0>for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.850
<v Speaker 0>So we'll see that in a in a bit.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 0>So we're actually going to go back to somewhat boolean

<v Speaker 0>Um yay.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone give me a reason why we like diagonal

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 0>The determinants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60]}

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 0>Easy, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 0>What else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 0>Multiplications.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Easy.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 0>easy?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 0>Yeah it's basically the reciprocal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 0>More or less you find the reciprocal of everything on

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 0>the diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 0>Um why is it easier to interpret transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 0>What is the diagonal transformation doing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,94,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's really easy to think of a combination of

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 2>those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 0>And we know geometrically what the elementary matrices are doing.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 0>So actually it's quite easy to interpret.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.590
<v Speaker 0>It's easy to calculate with we like diagonal matrices.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.850
<v Speaker 0>If we have a matrix like that, though, that's less

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.450
<v Speaker 0>nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 0>I mean, that one's got a load of zeros in.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.240
<v Speaker 0>That's not too bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.360
<v Speaker 0>I'm picking ones of loads of zeros in deliberately.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 0>But, um, if you had a big matrix they're not

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.330

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,79,100,83]}

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.240
<v Speaker 0>So you have to think about inverses and determinants and

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.780
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.330
<v Speaker 0>So we actually want things to be diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.520

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.860

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,38,100]}

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.380
<v Speaker 0>We have a diagonal matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.940
<v Speaker 0>We want to make something diagonal.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:05.200

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.200

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,100,100,85]}

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.870

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.090
<v Speaker 0>So when are we diagonalisable?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.820
<v Speaker 0>When can we make a matrix diagonal?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.490
<v Speaker 0>It's when we've got some matrix P where Papp holds

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.080

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100]}

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.510

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.770

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 0>exists.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 0>You cannot always diagonalise a matrix, but you can sometimes.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 0>And when you can, that's what we mean.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 0>We mean that p inverse a p equals a diagonal

<v Speaker 0>matrix D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.300

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:05.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 0>If we're diagonalisable, then we have p inverse a p

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.990

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.820
<v Speaker 0>How does that simplify?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Brilliant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89]}

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.830
<v Speaker 0>So say, if I actually wanted to find a squared.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.100
<v Speaker 0>Brilliant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.470
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.060
<v Speaker 0>I can now find a squared.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.970
<v Speaker 0>That's a lot easier than doing matrix multiplication with the

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.260
<v Speaker 0>Particularly when we see the finding p is actually quite

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 0>easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.600
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.900
<v Speaker 0>So when we have a p inverse AP equals d

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.610
<v Speaker 0>what do we know about the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.080
<v Speaker 2>This is the product of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,81,97,81,64]}

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.670
<v Speaker 0>So the weak easily find the determinant of D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.630
<v Speaker 0>And we know the determinant of p and p inverse

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.770
<v Speaker 0>are reciprocal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.360
<v Speaker 0>Determinants are just numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.240
<v Speaker 0>So actually we can quite easily see the determinant of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.400
<v Speaker 0>A is just the determinant of d.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 0>And I can do that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 0>That's an easy calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 0>So determinants are nice to um and equally finding inverses

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,97,100,40,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:49.690
<v Speaker 0>is good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 0>And we'll talk more about interpreting transformations when we talk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.770
<v Speaker 0>about similar matrices more generally okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 0>So diagonal matrices this does retain the properties we want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 0>to retain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 0>It's really nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 0>So how do we find P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 0>I've said it's kind of easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 0>Um so we're diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 0>If our eigenvectors can form a matrix like that which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 0>is invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 0>So what I mean there is you take your first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 0>eigenvector as your first column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,72,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.110
<v Speaker 0>Your second eigenvector is the second column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:22.770
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.760
<v Speaker 0>Third eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.750
<v Speaker 0>Your third column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100]}

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.940
<v Speaker 0>Keep going, keep going, keep going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.820
<v Speaker 0>So all you've got to do is find your eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.030
<v Speaker 0>and then bung them together in a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.160
<v Speaker 0>You don't actually have to do anything more with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then if we have it our diagonal matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.390
<v Speaker 0>is really nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.660
<v Speaker 0>It's just the eigenvalues again eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 0>Making life really easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.800
<v Speaker 0>So we know we're diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.520
<v Speaker 0>If that matrix is invertible, is there a shortcut to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.660
<v Speaker 0>working out for that invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.490
<v Speaker 0>Because that's also a bit of a tricky calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.000
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh, no eigenvector is good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,65,78,36,33]}

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.330
<v Speaker 0>So even if your eigenvector is zero, you can still

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.860
<v Speaker 0>that means your matrix is not invertible, but that we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.350
<v Speaker 0>not trying to invert A we're trying to invert P,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.760
<v Speaker 0>which is our new matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.110
<v Speaker 0>At the back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.880
<v Speaker 0>So the determinant of the matrix A or the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.270
<v Speaker 0>of P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100]}

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.330
<v Speaker 0>We want to determine a p not to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.710
<v Speaker 0>But again working out the determinant of a disease and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,71,100]}

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.990
<v Speaker 0>its p is going to allow us to prove that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.710
<v Speaker 0>A is easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100]}

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.560
<v Speaker 0>But P is a different matter altogether.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.770
<v Speaker 0>And actually we have a result to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.440
<v Speaker 0>So that theorem just gave us those two results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.140
<v Speaker 0>Turns out we're diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.690
<v Speaker 0>If every eigenvalue of some algebraic multiplicity has m corresponding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.140
<v Speaker 0>basic eigenvectors, or to put it in the language we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.060
<v Speaker 0>just said, your algebraic multiplicity always equals your geometric multiplicity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:04.400
<v Speaker 0>So in this case we are diagonalisable because yes we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.960
<v Speaker 0>had algebraic multiplicity two, but we also had geometric multiplicity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.350
<v Speaker 0>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.570
<v Speaker 0>So for every eigenvalue including repeats we have a different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:15.380
<v Speaker 0>eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 0>If that happens then we're all good and happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 0>And we're diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100]}

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 0>Are people happy so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so, did I have anything else I wanted to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 0>say here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 0>Kind of corollary, if you've not got any repeated eigenvector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 0>values at all, then you would definitely diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.840
<v Speaker 0>Because of that inequality, we know every eigenvalue has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.040
<v Speaker 0>have an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.250
<v Speaker 0>So if you've got and we know that there are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,73,74]}

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.980
<v Speaker 0>going to be n eigenvalues for an n by n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.670
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.000
<v Speaker 0>So if you've got n distinct eigenvalues you've got to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.800
<v Speaker 0>have n distinct eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.210
<v Speaker 0>And you've not got to go any further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 0>So let us do a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.200

<v Speaker 0>Um a bit of practice here.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.370
<v Speaker 0>How am I going to get this all up on

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.480

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.520

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.780

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.100
<v Speaker 0>So let us go back to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:17.910
<v Speaker 0>Is that working?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.080
<v Speaker 0>Brilliant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:02.820
<v Speaker 0>Good.

<v Speaker 0>What's d going to be.

<v Speaker 1>Yes.

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 0>Does it matter?

<v Speaker 0>Not at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Speaker 0>So we could have written these 1006 minus three four

00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 0>So there's not one answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 0>There were several answers.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.080

<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.530

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:42.680
<v Speaker 0>Actually um this one I can can see why you

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.920
<v Speaker 0>think that this is, you know, this is a classic,

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.390
<v Speaker 0>But you might as one of those comments said, this

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 0>So here's another matrix with eigenvalue one and a double

<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.030
<v Speaker 2>So the first question we have just so one but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,79,99,6,7,98,54,97,65]}

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.450

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,62,81,100,91]}

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I think we split it up into two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,70]}

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.940

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.860
<v Speaker 0>So actually if we so if we think about what's

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.790
<v Speaker 0>going on in this case, we are preserving a plane.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:13.270

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.590
<v Speaker 0>We're preserving the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:22.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, so geometrically, anything that plane is mapped to, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.770
<v Speaker 0>I double by two is mapped to double itself.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:31.000
<v Speaker 0>But that plane is kind of, um, preserved as a

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.480
<v Speaker 0>play.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.670
<v Speaker 0>In the second case, though.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.530
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.670
<v Speaker 0>That's the wrong question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh, in this case, um, we've got eigenvalue one is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.430
<v Speaker 0>occurring twice, but it's only preserving the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.470
<v Speaker 0>You can kind of think of it as like preserving

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so it's a doubly preserved line, but you've

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.590

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.960
<v Speaker 0>that's fixed by one, and then you've got this other

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.310

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, there are reasons later on that we will come

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.200

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.020
<v Speaker 0>So you need three directions that are kind of, uh,

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.390

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.550
<v Speaker 0>one line that's fixed, another line that's fixed, and then

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:25.560
<v Speaker 0>you've kind of got a third dimension that's doing something,

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.100
<v Speaker 0>but it's not being a linear, it's not being invertible.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we can't diagonalise it later on.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.680
<v Speaker 0>in that case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, so it might kind of the crux of

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.620

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.880

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.270

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.230
<v Speaker 0>So when it's repeated algebraically, that doesn't guarantee that a

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.030

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.810
<v Speaker 0>going to end up with three minus two, minus three,

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.630
<v Speaker 0>two, zero, minus two, zero minus two, and then minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.560
<v Speaker 0>Which if you think about these two rows, actually if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.680
<v Speaker 0>you think about that that's a degenerate matrix altogether.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,51,100,100]}

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's what's going on there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, and why it's not working.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.400
<v Speaker 0>Um, so one other thing I just want to say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.460
<v Speaker 0>kind of before the end, that's more or less I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.630
<v Speaker 0>do need a bit of time at the end.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, two things I want to say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.940
<v Speaker 0>Firstly, sometimes you have to check this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.250
<v Speaker 0>It's always worth checking your answer, partly because it's a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.870
<v Speaker 0>good check to make sure you actually work at your

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.370
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors correctly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 0>So you might be tempted to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 0>Matrix multiplication do p inverse AP equals D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,79,100,100,100,85]}

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone think of an easier way of doing this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 0>calculation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 0>What's the hard bit of doing that calculation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I don't want to find p inverse but I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 0>quite happy to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 0>That's a lot easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.640
<v Speaker 0>So if you're doing a check try not to check

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.440
<v Speaker 0>Check that you should do a check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 0>Checks a nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,62,100]}

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 0>That's a much easier check than than the other one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.490
<v Speaker 0>Um, the other thing I want to say is to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 0>kind of go back to where this all started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I've kind of said linear transformations have eigenvectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 0>and eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, it turns out every matrix has an eigenvalue at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.500

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 0>Therefore, um, but yesterday we said that rotations don't fix

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:47.760
<v Speaker 0>lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 0>That's the one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66]}

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 0>That's the one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,49,56]}

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.910
<v Speaker 0>Uh, rotations don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,78]}

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Fix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.330
<v Speaker 0>Lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.690
<v Speaker 0>What does a rotation fix?

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.270
<v Speaker 0>The plane distance of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,56]}

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.500
<v Speaker 0>Actually, that's a good point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.460
<v Speaker 0>If we're preserving distance, then we're preserving the circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 0>So actually I can go back to this picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have preserved I have preserved a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,94,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.490
<v Speaker 0>This is not a straight line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.510
<v Speaker 0>It's a curved line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:23.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, turns out that in a rotation, you do have

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.800

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:32.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, but your eigenvalue is complex.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.460
<v Speaker 0>Decent fortune for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.000
<v Speaker 0>One last thing though.
