<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 0>It is ten past, so we will get started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 0>It's week ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it's the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 0>There are vision lectures next week, but this week is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 0>the last week of new material.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 0>And then you've learnt every bit of linear algebra you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.450

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 0>and the questions will clap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,48,45]}

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, but while we do that, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, talkative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 0>We've turn.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32,22]}

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 0>So we've jumped to chapter eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,73,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 0>We may have skipped over a couple of chapters there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, feel free to go and read chapter six and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 0>seven if you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh, they're not actually got much new material in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,84]}

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 0>All stuff you've seen before, but they're generalising away from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,93,100,100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 0>real vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 0>So when we've been talking about vectors, we've been talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 0>about vectors in our n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,90]}

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 0>So lists of real numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, and kind of we've built up what that means

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 0>geometrically and algebraically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 0>Turns out you can generalise everything we've done to vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 0>that aren't necessarily just lists of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's what chapter six and seven are doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 0>They're building up this definition of a vector space and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 0>looking at kind of generalised linear algebra, where you've not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 0>just got vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 0>In some ways the linear algebra is not changed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 0>It's just the vectors have changed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to go give it a read if you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 0>want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 0>At some point, lots of you will end up studying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 0>that type of linear algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 0>But that is not what we're doing in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.770
<v Speaker 0>So we skip to chapter eight sticking with our real

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,50,51,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 0>vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 0>And we are this week going to talk about orthogonal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.820
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm going to get rid of I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 0>this is the attendance will clap is going to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 0>away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 0>But there's the code for people who want it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 0>We're in Thursday's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,99,100]}

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's start with the true and false question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 0>If I have a list of vectors that is a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 0>basis of some subspace, you in R1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,91]}

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 0>So I'm giving you some subspace and I'm giving you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 0>a basis for that subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to give you a point in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 0>your subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 0>Is it true that I can write x as this

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 0>sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 0>So the dot product of x with v1 times v1.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 0>And then the dot product of x with v2 times

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.960

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 0>about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 0>Is it true that x can be written as a

<v Speaker 0>We are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 0>I don't want the axes there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,52]}

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.340
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.330
<v Speaker 0>Can I shift this over?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 0>Do do do do do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96]}

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.730
<v Speaker 0>Give me half a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Speaker 0>Let's do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, I don't know why I'm in Spanish today, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 0>there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.180
<v Speaker 0>Look at this vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.550
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to have two basis vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 0>We've got um we've got this blue one and we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 0>got this orange one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 0>So those are my two basis vectors that are sitting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.270
<v Speaker 0>on my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.770
<v Speaker 0>Uh, they span my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.340
<v Speaker 0>They they are not they're linearly independent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,76,100,100]}

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 0>So these two vectors are a basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, we're then going to consider this vector x, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,96,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.820
<v Speaker 0>doesn't lie on my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100]}

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.530
<v Speaker 0>It's just some vector over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we're going to consider a projection down onto

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.300
<v Speaker 0>my basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:52.320
<v Speaker 0>And the projection is this, uh, little green vector here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, if my vectors are not orthogonal, then this projection,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.370
<v Speaker 0>we kind of want it to be where that dotted

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:59.370 --> 00:13:59.940
<v Speaker 0>line is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.670
<v Speaker 0>That would kind of is our intuitive understanding of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.110
<v Speaker 0>the projection should be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100]}

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, but but the green vector is not going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.790
<v Speaker 0>the dotted line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.090
<v Speaker 0>Uh, when they're not orthogonal, we do not get the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,56,56,100,100]}

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 0>projection we kind of want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 0>We're not getting the kind of straightforward coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,98]}

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, this isn't telling us what we want to what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,46,99]}

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.090
<v Speaker 0>it kind of wants us to tell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 0>Even if all of these are normalised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.060
<v Speaker 0>It's still not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.860
<v Speaker 0>It's not even pointing in the right direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.370
<v Speaker 0>So if we're not got a normalised basis, then at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.740
<v Speaker 0>least that formula in the question would give us a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.850
<v Speaker 0>vector in the right direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.750
<v Speaker 0>It would just be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.630
<v Speaker 0>Actually, that's not necessarily true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, but but here it's it's giving us kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 0>complete nonsense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 0>That projection vector is not at all what we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, whereas if I fix it so my basis vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.200
<v Speaker 0>are orthogonal, um, then I do get exactly the projection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.810
<v Speaker 0>vector that I want, which makes me happy because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.160
<v Speaker 0>get maths as being nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100]}

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.630
<v Speaker 0>It's doing what I wanted to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.940
<v Speaker 0>The other thing to bear in mind is if when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.440
<v Speaker 0>they're not, um, when they're not orthogonal, then if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.710
<v Speaker 0>change my basis vectors, my projection changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.810
<v Speaker 0>So all I'm doing there is changing one of my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Speaker 0>basis vectors and my projection keeps changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.470
<v Speaker 0>It shouldn't be the case that when I project down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.610
<v Speaker 0>onto a plane, if I change how I'm like put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,45,100,98]}

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.820
<v Speaker 0>vectors on that plane, it shouldn't matter what how I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 0>defining that plane, the projection should always be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.000
<v Speaker 0>Whereas when I am orthogonal, I can change those bases,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.450
<v Speaker 0>but my projection is not changing, which is exactly what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.170
<v Speaker 0>we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.920
<v Speaker 0>So actually we only ever want an orthonormal normal basis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.740
<v Speaker 0>norm also gives us the right sizes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[27,27,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, but we really do want that orthogonality condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.110
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, weird and wonderful terrible things happen and we don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.010
<v Speaker 0>want that case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 0>Are we all happy?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.790
<v Speaker 0>Do we have any questions or thoughts?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.390
<v Speaker 0>Feelings?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.320
<v Speaker 0>Comments?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the normalised basis makes life easier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:16.510
<v Speaker 0>But we can of course do, um, we could change

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.810
<v Speaker 0>this formula to make it work for a non normalised

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Speaker 0>basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.930
<v Speaker 0>We just have to divide by the norm of VI's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,44]}

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.740
<v Speaker 0>So what this allows us to do is we're essentially

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.590
<v Speaker 0>saying we can always this is that form is giving

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 0>us the coordinates of a point with regards to a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 0>certain basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 0>So if we think about it in terms of standard,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 0>um, or when the be used to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,72,67,100,100]}

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 0>So let's do R2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 0>We have x and y we're very used to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 0>If I give you a vector we can write this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 0>as the .23 for example, which is saying we're going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 0>to along in the x and three along in the

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 0>y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 0>That's exactly what that formula is saying to this projection

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 0>is giving us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 0>The kind of coordinate points, uh, well, when it's, when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.569
<v Speaker 0>it's normalised, um, in relation to whatever basis we're picking,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 0>I could equally pick this basis.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.260

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.730

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.100

<v Speaker 0>I love the Gram-Schmidt process.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.570

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 0>So, um, let us consider a three dimensional vector space

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.540

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:05.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,87]}

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.260
<v Speaker 0>What do I do?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 0>What's the aim here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 0>The aim is to find what kind of basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 0>And yeah, an orthogonal basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,93,100,100]}

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 0>You can even go further and find an orthonormal basis.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.870
<v Speaker 0>So you can take any basis you want and make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 0>it an orthogonal basis, which is really quite fun because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.120

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.090

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 0>than it is an orthogonal basis.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.110
<v Speaker 0>But to do any calculations, it's a lot easier to

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.550

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 0>So that's kind of bridges the calculation gap.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.620

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.970
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone disagree with me?

<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:06.580
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that is one vector that is perfectly it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.830
<v Speaker 0>But I'm actually going to take F2 just to be

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.450

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.880
<v Speaker 0>I might as well pick a vector that's got nice

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.150
<v Speaker 0>So then we've got so what have we done here.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.350

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.780
<v Speaker 0>We did the subtraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 0>And then we're going to set that to be our

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.720

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.970
<v Speaker 0>So all we're doing is shifting this vector so its

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.140

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:16.690

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.210
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:22.750
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.630
<v Speaker 0>I've now just got two vectors, Um, but I also

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.670
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what should I do for you three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 0>How can I find my third basis vector in my

<v Speaker 0>on all basis?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,60,99]}

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42]}

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 0>Small projections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100]}

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we're going to do the same thing again,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 0>but we need to project both onto the U1 vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 0>and onto the, the both onto the F1 vector and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 0>the F2 vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.050
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to and then subtract both.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.400
<v Speaker 0>So we are doing F3 is going to be this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 0>initial vector minus its projection onto F1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 0>Uh we can steal a bit from F1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 0>We now know that this denominator is going to be

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 0>six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 0>So let's save ourselves some time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.050
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.170
<v Speaker 0>What is this dot product, though?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,90]}

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.440
<v Speaker 0>Uh, one minus two zero one.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.270
<v Speaker 0>Anyone got any ideas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.120
<v Speaker 0>What's this?

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.680
<v Speaker 0>Minus one.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:51.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:57.860
<v Speaker 0>So we have 1100 times minus one over six minus.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Speaker 0>So let's just make that plus a sixth of one

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.930

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.250
<v Speaker 0>Then what's this dot product two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:08.090
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 0>And this one three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:11.390
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay I'm going to leave you to do vector addition

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.100
<v Speaker 0>But hopefully if you do all of that and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 0>all works out and nothing goes terribly wrong.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.260
<v Speaker 0>You should end up with a half zero zero one

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:27.650
<v Speaker 0>half.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.500
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully that's what I got this morning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, are we all happy with how that works, though?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,98]}

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.250
<v Speaker 0>It's very iterative, so I can keep going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm just projecting down each time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.370
<v Speaker 0>So let's think about what we just did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.060
<v Speaker 0>Geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.080
<v Speaker 0>We projected onto v one, uh, and then we did

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,56,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.310
<v Speaker 0>a bit of subtraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we can also project onto V2 and do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.920
<v Speaker 0>some subtraction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.140
<v Speaker 0>And if we do both those subtractions at the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.930
<v Speaker 0>time, we end up with this vector v three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.440
<v Speaker 0>And all we're going to do is shift that vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.550
<v Speaker 0>So it's at the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:08.030
<v Speaker 0>And that's going to give us our orthonormal basis from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.630
<v Speaker 0>our.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:09.860
<v Speaker 0>Well no it's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.620
<v Speaker 0>It's going to give us an orthogonal basis from our

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.010

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.460
<v Speaker 0>and cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:17.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.470
<v Speaker 0>Are we all happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100]}

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.490
<v Speaker 0>Wonderful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.680
<v Speaker 0>So we now have I'm going to make again, make

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.410
<v Speaker 0>this a bit nicer, I'm going to say it's 1001

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.500
<v Speaker 0>for hopefully obvious reasons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.250
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 0>So that we've got an orthogonal basis also looking good.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.950

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.420
<v Speaker 0>Which is yet another reason for picking nice numbers that

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.570

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.290

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:53.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, if my vector is in my hand, then I

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.350

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.400

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, when would the second one be true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 0>When would our projection be absolutely zero?

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.780

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 0>So if it was in W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.000
<v Speaker 0>So actually bear in mind we know we're not in

<v Speaker 0>W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 0>It absolutely can't be the second one because we're not

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 0>um we're not in W and W is perpendicular to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100]}

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.850

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 0>the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 0>It's something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 0>Why might it be something else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 0>It could be a mix of both.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.980
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 0>All we've said is X is not in W.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 0>We've not said X is in the orthogonal complement.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 0>So if x is in the orthogonal complement then we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 0>in the case one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.630
<v Speaker 0>And the projection is going to be x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.710
<v Speaker 0>If we're not we know we're definitely not two because

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.850

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.480

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.010

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:35.990
<v Speaker 0>else?

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.400
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Why does that projection not be the orthogonal complement?

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.860
<v Unknown>Surely it's projecting onto the, um, complement of that, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.340
<v Unknown>So it would be complementary.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.780
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:59.120
<v Speaker 0>But there could be a component of X that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:04.970
<v Speaker 0>So we can split X into something that's there's a

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.950

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 0>So now let's look at a firm 8.4.1, uh, which

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.030

<v Speaker 0>far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it turns out the projection is a linear

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 0>transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.380
<v Speaker 0>We've seen this, I think you saw back in week.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.920

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.260

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.250
<v Speaker 0>So we know Italian transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.640
<v Speaker 0>More importantly, it turns out the image of your linear

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.960

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.290

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 0>And I'm not going to get something that's not on

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.860

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.780

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.200

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.290
<v Speaker 0>my subspace have to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 0>We're kind of working backwards here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 0>Slightly harder question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 0>So I know the only vector that's getting mapped to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 0>zero is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 0>So what am I mapping to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 0>Any guesses I win.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41,38]}

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah we've got to be mapping to everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 0>Because if we weren't mapping to everything then there'd be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.590
<v Speaker 0>some other vector that would get mapped to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 0>There would be an orthogonal complement that got mapped to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 0>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 0>Turns out if the only thing mapped to zero zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 0>Which always happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 0>It means we're being quite boring and just projecting onto

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 0>ourselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 0>That is it for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.580
<v Speaker 0>I will see you tomorrow for our final new content

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 0>lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 0>We can all be awake for Friday of week ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.190
<v Speaker 0>It will be loads of fun and then that will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 0>be that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Awful lot with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,76,100,100]}

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.900
<v Speaker 5>It just seemed like it was repeatedly interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,76,93,100,100,100,87]}

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, it shouldn't matter too much, but it will still

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.500
<v Speaker 0>be open now, so feel free to give it a

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 0>go now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:54.670
<v Speaker 0>It might still.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 6>Work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.830
<v Unknown>I know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:13.700
<v Unknown>Let's say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75]}

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.110
<v Unknown>Really?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.500
<v Unknown>Really?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Unknown>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 7>From last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100]}

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 7>Mhm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47]}

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.730
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 7>So all all symmetric matrix is diagonal diagonalisable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,68,68,45,100]}

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.870
<v Speaker 0>Um so we're talking a lot more about that tomorrow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 0>actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 0>Um but essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 6>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.040
<v Speaker 7>Do they have to be invertible or.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 6>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 6>So they'd have to be invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 6>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.450
<v Speaker 6>Why's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 7>Come up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 2>No, no that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 8>First related to the previous question of the more like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,94,96,46,51]}

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.350
<v Speaker 8>construction of axe on W firm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,85,100,78,49]}

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 8>And but also because I thought it's going to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,48,47,47,100]}

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 8>here, it's going to be mapped into w perm because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 8>of like in my mind construction works like we, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 8>imagine the line our project onto the line and gets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,100,35,34,24,57,100,100,100]}

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 8>on the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.240
<v Speaker 8>But when you start that, it can be something either

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.830
<v Speaker 8>because components can be different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100]}

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:03.360
<v Speaker 8>I got a little bit confused.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.420
<v Speaker 8>So how exactly what does it look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.080
<v Speaker 0>So so the case to think about here I should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.730
<v Speaker 0>probably turn this microphone off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}
