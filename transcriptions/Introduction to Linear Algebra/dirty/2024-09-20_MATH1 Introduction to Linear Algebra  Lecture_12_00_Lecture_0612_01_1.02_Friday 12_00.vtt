NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 0>So yeah I'm liking what's going on there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 0>What if we go here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 0>This is a bit more popular.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 0>Two thirds A few 25 comments.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 0>What have we saying?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 0>To create a row echelon matrix, add seven times of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,73]}

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 0>row 2 to 0 three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,95,95,95,100]}

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, first column is already in the form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 0>So you can turn columns two non 020.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,98,44]}

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 0>Uh multiply row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 0>We've got lots of suggestions about row three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 0>Add six lots of R2 or minus six lots of

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 0>row two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 0>Um everything kind of like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 0>The others don't make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100]}

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 0>Fair enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 0>Gaussian elimination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 0>So we're all kind of roughly talking about the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 0>similar vibes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 0>We want to add six lots of all subtract six

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 0>lots of row 3 to 6, lots of row one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 0>Generally that's probably what I would do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 0>I mean, you're not wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.580
<v Speaker 0>If you're going to do some micro three smaller first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,94,100,99,97]}

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 0>That's not a wrong answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 0>I would probably just dive in and get rid of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 0>that minor six and make it zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.570
<v Speaker 0>So doing something like row three add two lots six,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,99,79,100,100]}

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 0>lots of row two would be nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 0>Uh, eliminate that minus six altogether.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.320
<v Speaker 0>But again, it's kind of this question is more about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.580

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.100
<v Speaker 0>but the ones you have picked to kind of both

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 0>somewhat valid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.820
<v Speaker 0>So that was our little warm up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.250
<v Speaker 0>We are actually, this was a question I got at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.860

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we are going to talk about where echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100,100]}

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 0>So matrix is in row echelon form if it satisfies

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.810
<v Speaker 0>the following three properties I have just clicked the wrong

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.920
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so we want all zeros at the bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 0>It's the first point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 0>In some ways it's kind of the important one, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.000
<v Speaker 0>it's also the one that just means everything's tidy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,96]}

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.840
<v Speaker 0>It's kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.650
<v Speaker 0>We're tidying up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.720
<v Speaker 0>We want everything, all the zeros, to kind of be

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.760
<v Speaker 0>at the bottom where we can forget about them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.410
<v Speaker 0>We can cross them out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.970
<v Speaker 0>We can ignore them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 0>So let's start drawing a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,98,100]}

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.270
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so we're going to have a row of zeros

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.020

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 0>We can't see that.

<v Speaker 0>Oh, we're really zoomed in, aren't we?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 0>Let's zoom out a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.050
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we have all of those zeros at the

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.340
<v Speaker 0>bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we want the first non-zero entry from

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.340
<v Speaker 0>the left is the one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to call this the leading one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 0>Now this is quite important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.110
<v Speaker 0>Yell out some numbers for me.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.990
<v Speaker 0>Someone else five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 0>Another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.880
<v Speaker 0>Six.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.780
<v Speaker 0>I had a two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,49,92,100]}

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.360
<v Speaker 0>Uh, did I hear something else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 0>Nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Speaker 0>Nine seem to be the popular one there.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so there's my matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 0>Everything else is going to be zeros.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I have my leading ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 0>They're always to the right, uh, to the leftmost thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,94,100,100,100,73,100,100,83,100]}

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.640
<v Speaker 0>in their in their row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100]}

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.530
<v Speaker 0>They're my leading ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.320
<v Speaker 0>Leading ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we have our row of zeros at the

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.620
<v Speaker 0>bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.030
<v Speaker 0>So every other row has some entry in, and every

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.520

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.730
<v Speaker 0>So you end up with this kind of staircase effect,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.510

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.830

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.500

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.130
<v Speaker 0>We're not trying to skip steps.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.630
<v Speaker 0>We're going one little step at a time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.130
<v Speaker 0>It might be we walk along a bit and then

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 0>we take another step up.

<v Speaker 0>This is surprisingly hard to do on a flat thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.250
<v Speaker 0>And that's kind of how we spot, um, a reduced

<v Speaker 0>Pardon?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.290
<v Speaker 0>Turn the second 1 to 0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,98,98,98]}

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 0>Nowadays how.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.890
<v Speaker 1>To.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[23]}

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.180
<v Speaker 1>For minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[23,100,100]}

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.530
<v Speaker 1>For the second.

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:05.939
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:05.939 --> 00:17:07.560
<v Speaker 0>So I could take row two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,79]}

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.089
<v Speaker 0>My new row two could become row two minus row

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.670
<v Speaker 0>And then I'd end up with one.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.030

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.640
<v Speaker 0>My wrote my old row two minus row one is

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.079

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.750
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to have 0100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.920
<v Speaker 0>So then I could subtract row three from row two.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.640
<v Speaker 0>I could then do row three goes to row three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.200

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.760
<v Speaker 0>Row echelon form?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh, any ideas to divide it?

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.220
<v Speaker 0>Divide the last row.

<v Speaker 0>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.510
<v Speaker 0>I divide the last row by two.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.110
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.050
<v Speaker 0>So row three is going to go to half of

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.380
<v Speaker 0>That's a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,100,100]}

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.050
<v Speaker 0>And then we have every row starts with a one

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.260

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:44.930
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.220
<v Speaker 0>What do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.930
<v Speaker 0>How could I make it into reduced echelon form?

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 0>Swap the third and the fourth row.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.020
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.910
<v Speaker 0>So row three and row four could swap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.320

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.880
<v Speaker 0>What form are we then in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.370

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.630
<v Speaker 0>There are too many numbers in a matrix.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.020
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.480
<v Speaker 0>So then all our leading ones with the beginning and

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.470

<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 0>We have a nice staircase.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that was quite a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.610

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:33.440
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 0>Why do we like this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 0>Why is this a form we want to go to?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 0>Why are we quite, like, row echelon form?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 1>You can solve for each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,99,100,99]}

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 0>Were you going to say anything differently?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.330
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 0>So we have two results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 0>The two kind of big theorems in the reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 0>One that says all matrices can be written into row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 0>reduced row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 0>I will say right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:08.800
<v Speaker 0>Eventually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, so any matrix in the world can be written

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 0>as something that looks a bit like that, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 0>quite a big result when you think about if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 0>just take a moment to think about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 0>Any matrix in the world just using three rules can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 0>be made to have ones leading them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 0>Zeros can be made mainly to look like zeros and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 0>ones because that's what this form does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.460
<v Speaker 0>It means potentially up to half your matrix is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.220

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, you can cancel quite a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we've got so that's them 2.2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.940
<v Speaker 0>And then we have this other theorem that says if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:58.350
<v Speaker 0>you perform a sequence of operations, uh, the results our

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.320

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.350
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone remind me what equivalent means.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.200

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.110
<v Speaker 0>And one one implies the other same set of solutions.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.490

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.570
<v Speaker 0>So these two matrices here, they're not the same.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.280

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.640
<v Speaker 0>If you multiplied this matrix by something and the this

<v Speaker 0>You get different answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.110
<v Speaker 0>There's not they're not the same matrix.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.530

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.930
<v Speaker 0>So the x and y values were the x values.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:02.940
<v Speaker 0>Here the satisfy this also satisfy this system, which makes

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.250
<v Speaker 0>sense actually if you think about this this is saying

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.660
<v Speaker 0>x equals one.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 0>write down solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.070
<v Speaker 0>So let us start a new sheet of paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 0>Well, go back to the Aldridge paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,24,100]}

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 0>We got this matrix 122110112 and 001 and a half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.460
<v Speaker 0>So that was from matrix number five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, and again this was a question I heard yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.020
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes people write a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 0>We're going to see what kind of why in a

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 0>minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 0>I guess it's separating out the system from the answer

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 0>to solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100]}

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes I'll draw a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes I won't draw a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes the textbook will draw a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,95]}

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes a textbook won't draw a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 0>It's one of those maths things that sometimes happens and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:23.870
<v Speaker 0>sometimes don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 0>We don't care if you draw a line or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 0>You can if you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.290
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes it's useful to have the distinction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.090
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to do a method called back substitution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, and essentially what we're going to do is we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.810
<v Speaker 0>going to rewrite this method or this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,37,100,100]}

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.010
<v Speaker 0>It's an augmented matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.420
<v Speaker 0>We're going to go back and write it as a

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.680
<v Speaker 0>system of equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.460
<v Speaker 0>So what's the last equation in the system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,98,89,100]}

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.210
<v Speaker 0>Z equals a half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.780
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.480
<v Speaker 0>That's really nice I know what z is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.090
<v Speaker 0>Um what's the second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100]}

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.740
<v Speaker 0>Y plus z equals two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,99,100,100]}

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.280
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.740
<v Speaker 0>But I also know z equals one half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,72]}

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.700
<v Speaker 0>So that's going to give me the y equals two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.630
<v Speaker 0>minus one half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100]}

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.620
<v Speaker 0>So three halves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.690
<v Speaker 0>What's the first equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.200
<v Speaker 0>Okay I got that mostly from the various mumbling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.870
<v Speaker 0>So that's one minus two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.770
<v Speaker 0>Lots of one half is going to be zero minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.240
<v Speaker 0>three two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.200
<v Speaker 0>Lots of three halves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98]}

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.070
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be minus three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.990
<v Speaker 0>So very quickly I've got the solution out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.760
<v Speaker 0>Hooray I've solved a system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,68,100]}

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.590
<v Speaker 0>And that was very easy to solve compared to for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:52.030
<v Speaker 0>example um, this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.480
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone tell me what the solution to this matrix

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.020
<v Speaker 0>is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.620
<v Speaker 0>Anyone want to take a guess about the solution to

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.250
<v Speaker 0>that matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.710
<v Speaker 0>Is all that linear system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100]}

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.140
<v Speaker 0>It's exactly the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.560
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.110
<v Speaker 0>Because yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.010
<v Speaker 0>So a little a little bit of extra things.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.250
<v Speaker 0>If you want to spend some fun time on a

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.810
<v Speaker 0>Friday night doing some extra maths.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 0>Can you show that I can row reduce that bottom

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 0>matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 0>If I follow Gaussian elimination and go all the way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 0>through, I get that top matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 0>You should be able to do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.400
<v Speaker 0>You should be able to reduce that into that and

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.780
<v Speaker 0>get the same answer out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 0>But hopefully we all agree it was a lot easier

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 0>to get the answer out of the top one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 0>We could almost just kind of read that off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,54,99,100]}

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 0>In fact, if we're in, um, reduced row echelon form,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.800
<v Speaker 0>we can just read the answer off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 0>So if I kind of further, more reduced this matrix.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone tell me what matrix I'd get if I

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 0>went all the way to reduced row echelon form?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a clue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100]}

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 0>The first three columns would look like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 0>What would my last column be?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 0>Anyone got any ideas?

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.270
<v Speaker 0>Minus three.

<v Speaker 0>Three halves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95]}

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.030
<v Speaker 0>And what were the last one be?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.170
<v Speaker 0>One half.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:30.770
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.130

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.050
<v Speaker 0>So you don't necessarily have to go all the way

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.150
<v Speaker 0>to reduced row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.020
<v Speaker 0>You can get the answer fairly easily from row echelon

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.850
<v Speaker 0>world, when you're applying this to something outside of this

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.820
<v Speaker 0>course, you're probably dealing with bigger matrices.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.860
<v Speaker 0>You're probably coding this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.330
<v Speaker 0>If you're coding it up, you might.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.550
<v Speaker 0>It's not that many steps from there to there.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.590
<v Speaker 0>So you might as well get your computer to take

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 0>So I promised you yesterday I would give you the

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.450

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 0>It's actually the number of leading ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.830

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, which makes sense if we think about what, um,

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 0>elementary row operations doing, it's filtering out unnecessary information systematically

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:16.030

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.590

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 0>So each row operation takes out stuff that's repeated by

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 0>So actually we are in reducing our matrix.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:31.990
<v Speaker 0>We are reducing the number of unnecessary equations, unnecessary bits

<v Speaker 0>z is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it makes sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.160
<v Speaker 0>The number of leading ones should be the kind of

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.410

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.640
<v Speaker 0>Let's do a quick.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.210

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.640
<v Speaker 0>What ranks number two.

<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 0>So two of having three and two.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.740

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.970
<v Speaker 0>Number one when you know exactly when in row echelon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.400
<v Speaker 0>So we're only in row echelon form here.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.170

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.460

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 0>And we can, if we think about converting this back

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,84,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.740

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.510
<v Speaker 0>got x, y, and z.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's a three dimensional system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.410
<v Speaker 0>And I'm kind of saying, well, there's a leading one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 0>kind of with x so I can determine what x

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 0>is, and there's a leading one with Z.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 0>So I can determine what z is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 0>But why does not have a leading one in its

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 0>column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to have a bit of a problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 0>I can't really determine what Y is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 0>There's no leading one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.000
<v Speaker 0>I've not got a piece of meaningful information about why.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.240
<v Speaker 0>So this is going to be our free variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,91,100]}

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.460
<v Speaker 0>So I can say well that's y equal s I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,98,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.350
<v Speaker 0>know that's going to be my free variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.870
<v Speaker 0>Then this bottom equation is just going to tell me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.340
<v Speaker 0>well z equals four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.409
<v Speaker 0>So I know z is fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,96,100]}

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.280
<v Speaker 0>And then what's x going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.490
<v Speaker 0>What's this top equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,93,100]}

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah six minus two s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,87,100,100,89]}

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.010
<v Speaker 0>Does that make sense to everybody.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.649
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:56.649 --> 00:34:58.390
<v Speaker 0>So I've kind of got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.530
<v Speaker 0>Um I've managed to the leading ones tell me which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.320
<v Speaker 0>or the lack of a leading one tells me where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.400
<v Speaker 0>my free variables are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.080
<v Speaker 0>And even though I've not got a point as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.750
<v Speaker 0>solution now, I've still got a set of solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.080
<v Speaker 0>So just like yesterday, I could say all my sets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.310
<v Speaker 0>of solutions are s six minus two, s, s and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 0>four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.820
<v Speaker 0>And what actually might be more useful is to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.650
<v Speaker 0>this down as to kind of split the s off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,95,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:37.090
<v Speaker 0>So I could say this is 604 plus s lots

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.490
<v Speaker 0>of minus two one zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.440
<v Speaker 0>Does everyone see what I've done there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.750
<v Speaker 0>Bit of a step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.880
<v Speaker 0>So I've got this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.850
<v Speaker 0>I think it's hardest to see in this first point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.500
<v Speaker 0>I've not got an S here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.930
<v Speaker 0>So it's going into this kind of vector without an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.380
<v Speaker 0>S.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.630
<v Speaker 0>But here I've got a factor of S that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,87,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.500
<v Speaker 0>can kind of take out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.120
<v Speaker 0>And I can say it's minus two and one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:03.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is kind of on what we were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,86]}

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:12.910
<v Speaker 0>talking about yesterday here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:17.140
<v Speaker 0>I now have a point on my line, and now

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 0>I have a direction I can walk across.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 0>And S is telling me how far I can walk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 0>So six zero minus four is a point here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 0>Two minus two one zero is a direction there and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,70,92,100,100,78]}

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 0>S is telling me how many steps I should go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 0>in this direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 0>And I'm walking along a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100]}

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 0>Does that make sense to people?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.590
<v Speaker 0>Yes, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 0>So this is the basic solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 0>I can split it up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a bit of a think about this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 0>in higher dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.310
<v Speaker 0>Let's return to GeoGebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:19.580
<v Speaker 0>So a point A I've just randomly picked it's 604.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.010
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm going to define the point B I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 0>going to write a line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.260
<v Speaker 0>It's the point A plus some steps in the direction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.030
<v Speaker 0>of minus two one zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh look it's the thing we just had.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:36.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if I change what f is if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100]}

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.720
<v Speaker 0>change how many steps I'm walking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.650
<v Speaker 0>Oh, look, I'm forming a line that goes through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.560
<v Speaker 0>point A, which is what we'd expect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I could do another direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.120
<v Speaker 0>Instead of going off in that direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.680
<v Speaker 0>I could go off in that direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.160
<v Speaker 0>So I could instead, instead of looking at minus two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.680
<v Speaker 0>one zero, I could look at minus three for two.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.070
<v Speaker 0>And there's another parameter telling me how many steps I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:05.540
<v Speaker 0>can walk in that direction, and where am I going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.470
<v Speaker 0>to end up there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.290
<v Speaker 0>Oh going fast.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.580
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.680
<v Speaker 0>There's a line in that direction.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:18.770
<v Speaker 0>So can anyone guess if I have the system with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.270
<v Speaker 0>both of these?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.910
<v Speaker 0>What's going to happen?

<v Speaker 0>Books.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.210
<v Speaker 0>My space of solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.520
<v Speaker 0>Going to be a plane?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:28.760
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.630
<v Speaker 0>Two dimensional plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.680
<v Speaker 0>In fact, if I twist it there, that's quite clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78,57,75,99,100,98]}

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:35.840
<v Speaker 0>You can see the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.400
<v Speaker 0>So let's imagine I want a point that can go

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.410
<v Speaker 0>in in the plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.840
<v Speaker 0>So far I've only got two lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.670
<v Speaker 0>How do I get to a general point in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.210
<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.230
<v Speaker 0>Any ideas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.660
<v Speaker 0>Linear combination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.050
<v Speaker 0>Pardon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.330
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to take a linear combination of the

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:02.720
<v Speaker 0>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.700
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to go some steps in s in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.310
<v Speaker 0>the s direction and some steps in the R direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.350
<v Speaker 0>So where is my point D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 0>It should be in my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:14.650
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.990
<v Speaker 0>It's up there all the way up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.010
<v Speaker 0>That's not very good for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 0>If my plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 0>Say, if I wanted my D to be more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's try and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 0>Move this over a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 0>I could move.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.200
<v Speaker 0>So my point D is some point generally in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:38.860
<v Speaker 0>plane.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 0>And I can kind of go out to places between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Speaker 0>these two coordinates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 0>So in later courses we'll kind of see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 0>What we've done here is to find two new axes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.430
<v Speaker 0>You're used to getting to the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 0>If I give you two axes and I say go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.150
<v Speaker 0>to one one, you used to go in one direction

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 0>here and one direction here, and you're kind of here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 0>But what if your your axes are actually more like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 0>this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 0>That's what we're doing now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.620
<v Speaker 0>They're not necessarily right angles, but we've still got two

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.210

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:23.880

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.870

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.700
<v Speaker 0>So I need I know that one lot of x4

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.460

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.300

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.860

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.140

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.940

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.960

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.130
<v Speaker 0>It could be consistent.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.550
<v Speaker 0>Anybody got any other ideas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.980
<v Speaker 0>A should be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,93,100]}

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.450
<v Speaker 0>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41]}

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.340
<v Speaker 0>Someone had their hand up in the middle there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:10.370
<v Speaker 0>A equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100]}

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.950

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.290
<v Speaker 2>A has to be, not zero.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we've got some different answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.510
<v Speaker 0>That was a fairly comprehensive one at the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.970
<v Speaker 0>Let's think about what that bottom equation is saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,91,100]}

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:29.210
<v Speaker 0>It's saying a lots of x4 equals b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,91,100,100]}

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:36.230
<v Speaker 0>You can't see a lots of x4 is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.380
<v Speaker 0>b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.450
<v Speaker 0>That's what that last bit saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:43.730
<v Speaker 0>So if A equals 0BA better equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.420
<v Speaker 0>Or else you've got zero equals two again which we

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.080
<v Speaker 0>don't like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.150
<v Speaker 0>So yes I'm liking this idea at the back.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.400
<v Speaker 0>Either b equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.820
<v Speaker 0>In which case we just take x4 to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:01.370
<v Speaker 0>Or if b isn't zero then we kind of need

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.630
<v Speaker 0>a tb0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,24]}

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:07.460

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.750
<v Speaker 0>If B is not equal to zero, we don't want

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.670
<v Speaker 0>A to be zero, because otherwise we're going to have

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.620
