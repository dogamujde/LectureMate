<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 0>In case you're doing the lecture poll.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 0>So last week with Cordelia, you've done Gaussian elimination, and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 0>I thought I'd tell you just a little bit my

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.550

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 0>So that there is Gauss.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 0>And as I had seen on the old German ten

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.820

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 0>last series.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 0>And if you look closely on that one, behind him,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 0>you see some buildings there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95]}

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is a picture from a town where Gauss

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,54,49,100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.210

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, and my personal thing is that this is actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 0>my home town.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 0>This is where I am from now.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 0>It goes a little bit further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, there in Göttingen, it's the grave of Gauss.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,98,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, and you can see that this is a little

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 0>bit of a parkland.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,100,100]}

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 0>And actually where I grew up as a kid was

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 0>about 200m away from this park, and we'd just hang

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100,82,37,100,100]}

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 0>about there, and we literally used to play football right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.670
<v Speaker 0>next by that, that grave there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 0>So my, my thing is that I always say I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,90,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.290
<v Speaker 0>used to play football as a kid on the grave

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.070
<v Speaker 0>of gout.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90]}

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.910
<v Speaker 0>That's what gets you into mathematics then later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.590
<v Speaker 0>But okay, so that's just the sort of, um, little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51,99,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 0>thing there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's get into, um, what we're doing today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 0>And I think at this point I'm going to take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 0>this one down, um, and go back to the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 0>ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.460
<v Speaker 0>So, um, lecture today is about what we call matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 0>algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, so algebra sort of how you work with expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 0>So this is really how do you calculate with matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 0>and by extension with vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, so there's a few things of just basically calculation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 0>rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 0>How they out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,62,98]}

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.610
<v Speaker 0>How do you multiply matrix by scalar this transposition, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 0>it cannot do for numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.660
<v Speaker 0>And then the sort of main thing is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 0>be multiplication of a matrix and a vector, and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,41,78]}

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.300
<v Speaker 0>bit of where this is leading to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, I don't think I'm going to mention managed multiplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.580
<v Speaker 0>of two matrices either.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94]}

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.590
<v Speaker 0>I think this will come tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, and also the concept of a matrix inverse, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 0>is what we're going to do, um, tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,70,100]}

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 0>So, um, let's set up some light-hearted, um, warm up

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 0>Now I'm just I was hoping to do that on

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 0>what is your exposure to linear algebra matrices?

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 0>Probably while you're doing that, uh, say that one way

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.110

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.600

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.880

<v Speaker 0>film.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 0>But typically the question is what really are matrices?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 0>Now you can do stuff with them, but you don't

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.850

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.790

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.580

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.790

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.240
<v Speaker 0>question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.070

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's get into, um, what we wanted to do.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.660
<v Speaker 0>Let's start with matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.630
<v Speaker 0>So assuming we've got this situation we've got given a

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.320

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.890
<v Speaker 0>And I'm telling you the matrix has elements by J

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.810

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.160

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.870
<v Speaker 0>So if we're doing this which of these matrices am

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 0>And um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,93]}

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.880
<v Speaker 0>I believe I can just do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.120

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.310
<v Speaker 0>So this seems to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100]}

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.310
<v Speaker 0>So again I'm giving you one minute.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure why.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.100
<v Speaker 0>That is an exaggeration, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,94]}

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.240
<v Speaker 0>A couple of seconds.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.940

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.410
<v Speaker 0>Right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.290
<v Speaker 0>So this is more or less what I was expecting.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.540
<v Speaker 0>I think it's relatively obvious that A and D aren't

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.440
<v Speaker 0>Um but then the question is is it B or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 0>C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.650
<v Speaker 0>They're sort of just alternating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.070
<v Speaker 0>So it's the question of is I and what do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,76,71,100,64,47,75,100,100,100]}

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.420
<v Speaker 0>they what do they stand for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 0>So this this really is a little bit arbitrary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:51.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I think I'm going to, um, just spend

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.260
<v Speaker 0>a couple of minutes on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I've got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.440
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to swap these rounds, um, so that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Speaker 0>I can see, see what I'm writing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.360
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I have a matrix B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I want to sort of write down the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.800
<v Speaker 0>elements of this matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.130
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.160
<v Speaker 0>You don't see this where there's a matrix P, there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,72,72,100,55,100]}

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.900
<v Speaker 0>the matrix B, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,68]}

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.980
<v Speaker 0>Write down the elements of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,79,100,98,100,100]}

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.050
<v Speaker 0>I mean, I have to admit I usually have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.000
<v Speaker 0>make a, make a diagram.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.580
<v Speaker 0>So you're going to start with element B1 one up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.060
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.150
<v Speaker 0>Um and then it's element B1 two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.830
<v Speaker 0>Then it's B1 three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 0>And then the second Rhodes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,48]}

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 0>Be two one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 0>Be two two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 0>Be two three and then be three one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 0>Be three two and be three three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 0>So I think this is reasonably, um, sort of, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,97,100,99,100,100,92]}

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 0>intuitive, um, that you say, because we're reading from left

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 0>to right, the first row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 0>Certainly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 0>First of all that we're saying, well, first of all,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 0>B1 one B1 two, um, we are going to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,60,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.160
<v Speaker 0>we've got to first of all start increasing the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 0>index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Speaker 0>And then if we go into a new row, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 0>we start increasing the first index.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, another way to think about it is that it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 0>always with these indices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 0>It's always rows before columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 0>And that's a useful thing to keep in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 0>So the first index here will tell you which row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 0>you're in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 0>And the second index will tell you which column you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.020
<v Speaker 0>So if I now go and say, I've got this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.730
<v Speaker 0>rule that I want to say b I j um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,65]}

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.310
<v Speaker 0>is calculated as I minus j.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.950
<v Speaker 0>And if I then go and want to say work

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.200
<v Speaker 0>out the B1 two element here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,60,97,100,100]}

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.880
<v Speaker 0>So that's the one up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.410
<v Speaker 0>Um B1 two is then one minus two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,93,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.170
<v Speaker 0>Um so this is minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if I now look at b1 2 or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,94]}

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.230
<v Speaker 0>-1 there, um that is matrix C up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,93,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.710
<v Speaker 0>Um but as I say there's something arbitrary about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,91,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.680
<v Speaker 0>Either get into the habit of drawing the diagram or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.100
<v Speaker 0>remember row rows B4 columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, that should help to get you there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.500
<v Speaker 0>So, um, matrices got the wrong one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,91,84,100,100]}

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.680
<v Speaker 0>So just recap here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, rows before columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.680
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Also option C we have we have that right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,52,100,81,100,65,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 0>So if I talk about an M times n matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 0>um this is a matrix with m rows and columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 0>Again we're giving the rows the number of rows before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 0>the number of columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 0>The jth entry there corresponds to the entry in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 0>ith row column again rows before columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 0>And we have this notation that if I have elements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 0>given I j by a double index, then the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,87,100,61,73,100,83,100,100]}

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 0>made of all those elements I'm going to write in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,82,100,100,100,100,100,92,62]}

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 0>sort square brackets with a symbol I j in it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34,100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 0>So just saying this are the indices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 0>This are the elements that make up the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 0>Oh and rows before columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 0>Um, in case I haven't mentioned that yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 0>So let's go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 0>We've got matrices and so far matrix is really just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 0>a table of numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing more about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.100
<v Speaker 0>So what can we do with matrices?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.980
<v Speaker 0>The first thing is we can define rules how to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.790
<v Speaker 0>calculate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.930
<v Speaker 0>So easiest thing we can do is trying to add

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.460
<v Speaker 0>two matrices together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100]}

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.970
<v Speaker 0>And I've given you a few matrices here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.710
<v Speaker 0>And I want to know from you which matrices which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 0>pairs of matrices can you add together so that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.570
<v Speaker 0>can add every pair of these together, or only C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.010
<v Speaker 0>plus D or others, or actually I can't do anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.640

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.340
<v Speaker 0>I cannot add these matrices together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 0>So again give me a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.020
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to reset the poll here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,96,100,100,100,71,100]}

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we're going to do the same thing again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 0>Again I'm going to give you a one minute, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 0>for that poll.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.130
<v Speaker 0>Now I see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.780
<v Speaker 0>And you see the timer as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 0>So about ten more seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100]}

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 0>150.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 0>Good results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.320
<v Speaker 0>Very good, very good indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.000
<v Speaker 0>So now these all have a different shape and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,38,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.200
<v Speaker 0>cannot add them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.320
<v Speaker 0>You know, you can only add matrices together if they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.640
<v Speaker 0>have the same shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.080
<v Speaker 0>Now very few I was actually expecting more have answered

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60,92]}

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.560
<v Speaker 0>B that we can add C and D together and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 0>you might think that is okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.160
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if I ask you to add those together,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.000
<v Speaker 0>you know what you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.610
<v Speaker 0>You know, at first element of one vector with first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.810
<v Speaker 0>element of the other vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100]}

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 0>But this is a row vector and a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.690
<v Speaker 0>And they really are different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.460
<v Speaker 0>And it's really important to keep, keep in mind that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,36,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.190
<v Speaker 0>the difference that a row vector is not the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 0>as a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.800
<v Speaker 0>Although I have to say sometimes out of laziness or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 0>space restrictions or so, people will write a row vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.840
<v Speaker 0>when they really mean a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 0>But we should try not to do that and keep

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.130
<v Speaker 0>that in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 0>So a few things um, to say so we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.880
<v Speaker 0>only add matrices of the same size or more, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.460
<v Speaker 0>precise of the same shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I add to m times n matrices, I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.750
<v Speaker 0>not changing the shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100]}

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.340
<v Speaker 0>It's still m times n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91,100,100,100]}

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.760
<v Speaker 0>You must check that these two matrices are the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.650

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.650
<v Speaker 0>Especially important if you've got sort of long actually your,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.810
<v Speaker 0>uh, your, um, um, homework, um, has some matrix expressions

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.170

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.560
<v Speaker 0>Um, although I think in that case all matrices happen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,80]}

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.560
<v Speaker 0>Anyhow, um, remember row vector is not a column vector,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:16.079
<v Speaker 0>um, and vectors and to some extent are really just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,93,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.180
<v Speaker 0>a special case of matrices here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.600
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.079
<v Speaker 0>They're just um, n times 1 or 1 times m

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.920
<v Speaker 0>matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, depends a little bit on the interpretation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.079
<v Speaker 0>reputation, but for the time being, you can think of

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 0>these of just special matrices, really.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,95,100]}

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I'm talking just about a vector, um, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.290
<v Speaker 0>usually mean by this a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 0>So unless it's clear for some reason that I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 0>specifically a row vector unqualified, if I say something is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 0>a vector, it's always a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.690
<v Speaker 0>So next thing is we can multiply a matrix by

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.500
<v Speaker 0>a scalar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 0>If I say k times a, I'm just multiplying every

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.080

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.930

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, magnitude.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.530
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.890
<v Speaker 0>Only magnitude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>I think no, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100]}

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.340
<v Speaker 0>I'm asking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.890
<v Speaker 0>I think it's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100]}

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.140
<v Speaker 0>I'm just thinking, I think the sort of magnitude direction

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.110
<v Speaker 0>thing is, I know from the physicist that they do

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.830
<v Speaker 0>distinguish them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.580
<v Speaker 0>I know that's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.340
<v Speaker 0>There's another answer there a number, a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,94,100,100,100]}

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, a number in this case actually will be a

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.730
<v Speaker 0>number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, in general by scalar I mean it's sort of

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.400

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.220
<v Speaker 0>For what we're doing in this course, we will always

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.590
<v Speaker 0>work with numbers, probably always with real numbers.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.660
<v Speaker 0>It could quite easily be a complex number.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.770
<v Speaker 0>take a more abstract way into things later, um, it

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.700

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.170

<v Speaker 0>moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 0>And just for completeness, um, I'm just going to go

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.250
<v Speaker 0>do this here, um, on the visualiser.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,70]}

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.140
<v Speaker 0>Um, give me a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.450
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there is what I had.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,57]}

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.330
<v Speaker 0>So, for example, if I want to do something like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.820
<v Speaker 0>k times, um, the matrix one, two, three, four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.870
<v Speaker 0>So, um, I really am just going to multiply every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.700
<v Speaker 0>element of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.980
<v Speaker 0>So this is going to be k times one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is going to be k times two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 0>Or I can just write this as three k and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.880
<v Speaker 0>4k here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.730
<v Speaker 0>So that's the matrix k times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.110
<v Speaker 0>Um the matrix there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.500
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going slightly slightly fast through this because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.820
<v Speaker 0>think at the moment I believe this is relatively straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.590
<v Speaker 0>Um transposed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 0>So if I've got an M times n matrix not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Speaker 0>necessarily square.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, the transpose of the matrix, um, is the n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.420
<v Speaker 0>times m Matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.140
<v Speaker 0>So now swapping number of rows and number of columns

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.970
<v Speaker 0>whose rows are just the columns of the original matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.410
<v Speaker 0>in the same order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, I've written there a you usually denote this with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.200
<v Speaker 0>an A and an uppercase T.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.050
<v Speaker 0>Uh, some people are a bit particular and say this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.930
<v Speaker 0>isn't really a T, there should be some geometrical symbol

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.470
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, but I think a T will do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,83,100,100]}

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, and again, I believe I've got a poll through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 0>So here we've got a matrix, not square.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, a little bit more fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 0>Uh, which of those?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100]}

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 0>There is the transpose of my matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 0>And again, reset the poll and start it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 0>And I'll show you what we've got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:48.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48]}

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:07.410
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.700
<v Speaker 0>Just about finished.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:13.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.290
<v Speaker 0>Very, very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, pretty much everybody's got the right answer to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.780
<v Speaker 0>I just noticed that, uh, seems to be always see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 0>the right answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.500
<v Speaker 0>Or, um, should we agree the pose?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100,84,84,65]}

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.870
<v Speaker 0>I find sometimes you need to be a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,40,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.600
<v Speaker 0>careful of which actually is the first row, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.590
<v Speaker 0>the first column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, especially if it's a non square matrix, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.460
<v Speaker 0>more a matter of, of concentrating rather than not understanding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,86,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.180
<v Speaker 0>typically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.490
<v Speaker 0>All fine so far.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,61]}

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.070
<v Speaker 0>Now, now we're getting to something which I think is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:52.220
<v Speaker 0>a little bit more elaborate um, and more of possible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:52.940
<v Speaker 0>confusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.140
<v Speaker 0>So I don't want that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[22,100,84,100,100]}

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 0>I do want that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.550
<v Speaker 0>I do want that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.240
<v Speaker 0>I do want that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.530
<v Speaker 0>Sorry sorry, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 0>Confusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.620
<v Speaker 0>So, um, multiplication of a vector times a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I suspect that the majority of you will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.080
<v Speaker 0>have seen something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.170
<v Speaker 0>Multiplying matrices is vectors at school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,44,100,100,100]}

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there may be not quite in this manner here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.810
<v Speaker 0>So Nicholson says the following in its definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.320
<v Speaker 0>Uh, he says in order to multiply a matrix of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 0>the vector, we are taking the matrix M times n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,61,49,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.880
<v Speaker 0>So we know that means m rows and columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 0>And we're going to write this down as its as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.770
<v Speaker 0>its columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 0>So we're going to note them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,45,58,60,47,100]}

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 0>So we're writing down this matrix really just as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 0>collection of column vectors here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.720
<v Speaker 0>And that's a relatively standard trick if you're working with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.500
<v Speaker 0>matrices that occasionally, um, it's useful to view a matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,98,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.780
<v Speaker 0>as a collection of columns or as a collection of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.780
<v Speaker 0>rows, and then introduce notation to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.780
<v Speaker 0>So the first column here we're going to call a1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.330
<v Speaker 0>and then a2 and then a n and just two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,85,95,100,48]}

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.270
<v Speaker 0>because we've got an m times n matrix to n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:04.780
<v Speaker 0>columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.760
<v Speaker 0>It means you've got n vectors here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.720
<v Speaker 0>And every one of those vectors, um because we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100]}

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.950
<v Speaker 0>Em Rose is now a vector with Em components.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,99,100,76,100]}

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.740
<v Speaker 0>So this is what we have for the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.840
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.510
<v Speaker 0>We also got to have a vector and we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.370
<v Speaker 0>a vector with n components.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.600
<v Speaker 0>That's important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 0>If you do a matrix vector multiplication that the dimensions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:30.510
<v Speaker 0>match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.790
<v Speaker 0>So we have a vector with n components.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
<v Speaker 0>And then we say multiplying those we do the following

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.420
<v Speaker 0>uh that we take the first component of our vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.450
<v Speaker 0>here multiplied with the first column of our matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,79,100]}

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 0>And then add to that second component of the vector,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.510
<v Speaker 0>multiply it by the second column, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,46,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.750
<v Speaker 0>Um, so number of components in the vector has got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,93,93,100]}

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.460
<v Speaker 0>to be the same as the number of columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.960
<v Speaker 0>And we add that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 0>And that is the multiplication of a vector by a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.760
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think it's useful after doing this sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.030
<v Speaker 0>of generally it's useful to um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 0>Wrong one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 0>I want to see what I'm doing with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 0>To just do an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um, matrix, I do we see that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,62,70,100,100]}

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.530
<v Speaker 0>Matrix vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.920
<v Speaker 0>So you say we've got the following matrix here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 0>We've got a matrix one, two, three, four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I'm going to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 0>Multiply this by a vector which I'll just call x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,94]}

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 0>y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, the only reason I use letters here are the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,70]}

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 0>numbers that you sort of see where, where different items

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 0>come from in the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 0>So um, and then I've got these two columns here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to call this here column A1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 0>And that here is column A2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,76,100,100]}

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 0>Um and then I say what this is, is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 0>first component of my vector times A1 plus the second

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 0>component of the vector times A2, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,92]}

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh, some people, I think, again, physicists probably like to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.240
<v Speaker 0>underline all the vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.800
<v Speaker 0>Uh, mathematicians tend to sort of forget about that and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.660
<v Speaker 0>all the same thing anyhow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.180
<v Speaker 0>Or in other words, we always have to keep track

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.380
<v Speaker 0>of what certain objects are, um, vectors on special from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,78,98,100]}

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:29.680
<v Speaker 0>others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.620
<v Speaker 0>So you just have to do things by context.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.920
<v Speaker 0>So this is, um, you have space there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,79,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:43.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, x times one three plus y times two, four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then I can go and probably need more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:49.240
<v Speaker 0>space here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, and say, so this really is just a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.390
<v Speaker 0>And I can now, um, do it for every component

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:55.990
<v Speaker 0>of the vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.100
<v Speaker 0>So this is the vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,70,100]}

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.760
<v Speaker 0>Which component?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.290
<v Speaker 0>The first one is x times one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.560
<v Speaker 0>So this is just x plus two y in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.790
<v Speaker 0>first component.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 0>And then three x plus four y in the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 0>component.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 0>So this is our how we do matrix vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 0>Or at least how Nicholson says that we should do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 0>matrix vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this as I say, this might be this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 0>way of doing matrix vector multiplication might be different to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 0>what you've learned in school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 0>Uh, can I just ask for who have learned a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 0>different way of doing this in school?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, so quite a few, uh, who has learned it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 0>this way?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 0>Also, slightly less suspect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 0>The others haven't done it at all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, I say a little bit more about that, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 0>remember, this is this is doing matrix vector multiplication is

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 0>one possible way of doing that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 0>I've done the example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.380
<v Speaker 0>So now we know what matrix vector multiplication Implication is

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.110
<v Speaker 0>we need to think a little bit about its properties.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, so first thing I'm asking you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.990
<v Speaker 0>So say you're given a matrix and a vector and

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.700
<v Speaker 0>you can multiply them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.860
<v Speaker 0>Dimensions work.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.290
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise I'm not saying anything about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.350
<v Speaker 0>We know that A times x, the matrix vector product

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.280
<v Speaker 0>is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.890
<v Speaker 0>And we know the vector x is not zero.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, what does that mean for the matrix A?

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.480
<v Speaker 0>Do we know that A is zero or not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, and uh, let me just quickly go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.170
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:05.700

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:29.840
<v Speaker 0>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.040
<v Speaker 0>Nobody's changed their mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:32.630
<v Speaker 0>Did I do something wrong here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay, okay, so, uh, majority thinks this is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.450
<v Speaker 0>And indeed, you would think so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:42.170
<v Speaker 0>You would think so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.770
<v Speaker 0>I mean, after all, if we're doing numbers, if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.410
<v Speaker 0>do, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:48.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay, which one do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.020
<v Speaker 0>I don't want that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh, let's keep that up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:58.920
<v Speaker 0>The results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,76]}

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.550
<v Speaker 0>So if I'm doing numbers and say axe equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 0>zero, then I know that I have a equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.040
<v Speaker 0>zero or x equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.370
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.830
<v Speaker 0>And this is relatively fundamental.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if you're doing things like, uh, Factorising polynomials

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100]}

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.860
<v Speaker 0>for example, and setting that to zero, you know, one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 0>of the factors have to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.970
<v Speaker 0>This is something the argument comes at a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 0>the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 0>And you've internalised that argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,94,100,100]}

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, now the important thing to keep in mind is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.770
<v Speaker 0>we're not working with numbers anymore here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.790
<v Speaker 0>We've now introduced a, a whole new concept of vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 0>and matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.570
<v Speaker 0>And we introduced rules of calculating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.450
<v Speaker 0>And now we have to think about what things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.790
<v Speaker 0>we used to actually hold in this case and what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.900
<v Speaker 0>don't anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.570
<v Speaker 0>So this is the first thing that we're thinking does

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.620
<v Speaker 0>this still hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.010
<v Speaker 0>Now people have said they have no counterexample.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so let me just go back to that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 0>That we know what we're talking about actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 0>So who has a counterexample?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,56]}

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 0>I think you're.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80]}

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Sort of the matrix is 0001.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 0>Right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 0>Do I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 0>You can see it here 0001X0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 0>X or anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 0>So I can do something like that instead of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 0>X here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't have to be an X can be any number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 0>So I could for example have a five here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 0>And then if I work out what is a x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 0>Um okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 0>First, first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.260
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so five Five times zero zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.010 --> 00:34:00.820
<v Speaker 0>Second element is zero times zero, one and five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Speaker 0>Times zero zero will give me a zero and zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.090
<v Speaker 0>times zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.070
<v Speaker 0>One will give me zero everything zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.980
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Or in this case, uh, this isn't true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.440
<v Speaker 0>I can't have x not equal to zero, A not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,46,100]}

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.159
<v Speaker 0>equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.080
<v Speaker 0>And still their product is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:34:20.379 --> 00:34:23.980
<v Speaker 0>So as I said be aware that we're talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.159
<v Speaker 0>and we keep doing this in mathematics introducing new concepts,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 0>introducing rules how to work with them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.040
<v Speaker 0>But any properties that we think these things now have,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.590
<v Speaker 0>we'll have to be really careful and have to start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,87,87,100,100]}

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.320
<v Speaker 0>proving them and have to be convinced ourself that this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.570
<v Speaker 0>that this does work well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89]}

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.050
<v Speaker 0>And there's probably one of the main takeaways from this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.379
<v Speaker 0>first math lecture, uh, for you, that you'll have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:50.790
<v Speaker 0>get into the habit Um, of always checking that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.899
<v Speaker 0>Okay, um, keep doing this on the wrong one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:54.899 --> 00:35:00.150
<v Speaker 0>So let's go on to, um, still matrix vector multiplication,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.500
<v Speaker 0>actually, but the other way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.830
<v Speaker 0>So, um, for the other way of doing this, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.520
<v Speaker 0>need the concept of a dot product or a scalar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.180
<v Speaker 0>product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that is the following, um, that you say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.380
<v Speaker 0>I've got given two vectors of the same dimension, say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.590
<v Speaker 0>n dimensional, um, and I can now do the dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.550
<v Speaker 0>product of these by saying by basically sort of zipping

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.850
<v Speaker 0>them up, uh, first element of the first vector times,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.820
<v Speaker 0>first element of the second vector plus, second times, second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.670
<v Speaker 0>plus third times, third and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 0>And again, um, I think, um, just out of completeness,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to do an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I do this partially because I reckon, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67]}

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.280
<v Speaker 0>the dot product is probably in this sort of operations,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.530
<v Speaker 0>what you can do with matrices and vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.660
<v Speaker 0>This is probably the most used one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.220
<v Speaker 0>You keep doing this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.400
<v Speaker 0>This keeps popping up everywhere, and you keep having to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.970
<v Speaker 0>do dot products of two matrices of two vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,71]}

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.450
<v Speaker 0>So um, if you're doing this this is one times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,63,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.900
<v Speaker 0>five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.170
<v Speaker 0>Here the two first element multiply together plus the two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:15.860
<v Speaker 0>second elements three times minus two plus seven times one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.150
<v Speaker 0>Um and if I do this so I've got five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.860
<v Speaker 0>um, five plus six is 11.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.360
<v Speaker 0>Um this is no minus six five minus six is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.760
<v Speaker 0>minus one plus seven is six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.280
<v Speaker 0>So the dot product here is six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.000
<v Speaker 0>Yeah okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,86]}

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:43.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, from the example be aware of the notations here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.520
<v Speaker 0>and be aware in two ways.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.220
<v Speaker 0>First of all, people use different notations for the dot

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:48.880
<v Speaker 0>product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.470
<v Speaker 0>I use this dot in the middle, and I think

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 0>Nicholson by sort of implication, does something like that.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.430
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I've seen, at least in some Scottish schools or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.830
<v Speaker 0>some Scottish school books, that they use a dot at

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.580
<v Speaker 0>um, I believe, especially if you're doing stuff in sort

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.390
<v Speaker 0>of more abstract vector space at some point, uh, or

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.350
<v Speaker 0>the physicists tend to think it's quantum physics or something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:20.830
<v Speaker 0>like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.590
<v Speaker 0>They're half notation that are inspired by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, but these are all the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.930
<v Speaker 0>These are all the dot products and actually u transpose

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 0>V.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.090
<v Speaker 0>So taking the vector u transpose a row vector times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.540
<v Speaker 0>v as the matrix vector product turns out to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.470
<v Speaker 0>the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.790
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and some people prefer to use that notation, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73]}

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 0>for the dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 0>On the other hand, be aware that there's other notations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 0>like u dot v, u cross v and simply saying

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.300

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 0>So you dot v is the dot product that we've

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 0>done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 0>You cross V is the cross product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 0>I think we're doing that later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.560
<v Speaker 0>You find the cross product is useful in three dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 0>And it's something that I think those of you doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 0>computer science, computer graphics or physics that are quite often

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.580
<v Speaker 0>working in three dimensions will use the cross product quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 0>often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 0>Mathematicians tend to not because we tend to work in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.160
<v Speaker 0>n dimensions rather than three dimensions, and there's no cross

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 0>product there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.190
<v Speaker 0>You've just written like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.850
<v Speaker 0>I would interpret this as a column vector times a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.390
<v Speaker 0>column vector as matrix vector multiplication, and then it just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.230
<v Speaker 0>doesn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.310
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the dimensions don't match, actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you can't do that, but be aware of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.140
<v Speaker 0>these different notations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85]}

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.760
<v Speaker 0>But if we know the dot product, Nicholson now has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.990
<v Speaker 0>a different way of defining what a matrix vector multiplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.380
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, and it says the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:04.370
<v Speaker 0>Each entry of the vector axe is the dot product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.310
<v Speaker 0>of the corresponding row of A with x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, and again, I think it's useful to have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.130
<v Speaker 0>look at an example here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.300
<v Speaker 0>So um, if I say I want to do so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.180
<v Speaker 0>this is again matrix vector product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.750
<v Speaker 0>Um and it's the row approach.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.650
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.260
<v Speaker 0>So um say I want to do the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 0>I've got one, two three, four And I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 0>multiply this with x y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 0>So this is the same thing that I've done a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 0>little bit above.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 0>So it says in order to get from the result,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 0>in order to get the first entry here, I should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 0>take the dot product of the corresponding row of a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 0>So the corresponding row is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,58,100,98,100,100]}

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.180
<v Speaker 0>Here one two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 0>Again we're taking the matrix apart, this time by rows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 0>and taking the dot product with xy with a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,97,100]}

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 0>So I like to sort of if I mentally visualise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.440
<v Speaker 0>that I take this vector then and sort of flip

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 0>it and put it over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 0>So I mentally think there's an x here, there's the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 0>y here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.130
<v Speaker 0>And then I sort of sum that up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:26.170
<v Speaker 0>So this will give me a one times X1X plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 0>A2Y for the first component.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 0>And then we do the same thing with the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 0>component.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.370
<v Speaker 0>Flipping this over.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.680
<v Speaker 0>And I've got A3X plus for?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.310
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:38.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:44.700
<v Speaker 0>Same result that we had the last time, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100,98]}

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, should say 1 or 2 remarks on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,97,97,100,100,100]}

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, we've got these two equivalent approaches of doing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:51.900
<v Speaker 0>dot product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, it tends of doing the matrix vector product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.970
<v Speaker 0>What I've done here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, I find, um, you might find it differently, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.000
<v Speaker 0>I find this is easier to remember and easier and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,84,100]}

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.750
<v Speaker 0>quicker to do for hand calculations if I'm actually asked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.910
<v Speaker 0>to multiply matrix vector by hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.830
<v Speaker 0>Now, the other approach that we did earlier, um, doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.460
<v Speaker 0>it by columns, tends to be more useful for theoretical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.820
<v Speaker 0>things if you're trying to derive, if trying to prove

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.970
<v Speaker 0>a theorem or doing some theory tends to be more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.390
<v Speaker 0>useful there, but both are equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, now Nicholson decided to take the the other approach.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 0>The column approach asked his definition of the matrix vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 0>multiplication, and then prove as a theorem that the dot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 0>product way is equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100]}

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 0>That is just arbitrary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, you could have done it just the other way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 0>round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 0>You could have defined this dot product approach as being

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 0>what the matrix vector product is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 0>And proof the other thing as a theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 0>It's I don't know why Nicholson has done it this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 0>Personal preference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 0>But again, it's a concept that we see quite often

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.500
<v Speaker 0>in mathematics that we've got a concept that are various

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 0>different ways how we could define them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 0>We define it in one manner and then prove that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 0>all the others are equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 0>So you will see that way of working quite often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so a couple more things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,100]}

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, for the end of the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, one is identity matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100]}

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this comes up quite often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, we have an identity matrix which is denoted by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.240
<v Speaker 0>an eye.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54]}

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.540
<v Speaker 0>Or, if you want to be particular, I tend to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,41,100]}

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.250
<v Speaker 0>indicate this is the identity matrix in n dimensions, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.100
<v Speaker 0>is the matrix which has once on the main diagonal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.350
<v Speaker 0>and zeros everywhere, everywhere else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:48.640
<v Speaker 0>So what does this mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, so say I want i3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, I am working in three dimensions here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the main diagonal is this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have ones there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100]}

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.420
<v Speaker 0>So I've got two, one, one and another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.380
<v Speaker 0>If I'm in three dimensions and everything else is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:09.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:16.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the, um, reason for doing that, um, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.740
<v Speaker 0>really to or the importance is really the following there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.610
<v Speaker 0>that you will find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:25.030
<v Speaker 0>If I multiply the identity matrix with a vector, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:26.410
<v Speaker 0>will get the vector back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.910
<v Speaker 0>And again um, let's just do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.110
<v Speaker 0>So if I say if I want a more deploy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:43.740
<v Speaker 0>this here I three uh, times x, so 100010001.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,73,70,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:45.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65]}

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.680
<v Speaker 0>I've got the times x, y z.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, then well, let's do the column approach again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.930 --> 00:44:03.390
<v Speaker 0>I have x times 100 plus y times 010 plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.120
<v Speaker 0>z times 001.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.170
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.930
<v Speaker 0>And that if I sum this up, this is an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 0>X or the others are zeros.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,90,96]}

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.940
<v Speaker 0>This is a y and that is a z.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.460
<v Speaker 0>So I will, um, get my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.000
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.960
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100]}

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.870
<v Speaker 0>Get my vector back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we will see that this is quite often

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:26.460
<v Speaker 0>with other things as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,92]}

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 0>The identity, um, will not change something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.280
<v Speaker 0>Um, note I just want to make you aware.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,77,86,100,71,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.970
<v Speaker 0>I've written my matrix, my vector X here as a

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.510

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.840
<v Speaker 0>to put a transpose on this to say I want

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.560
<v Speaker 0>this flipped.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.350
<v Speaker 0>What my matrix, what the vector x is should really

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.220
<v Speaker 0>be a column vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.990
<v Speaker 0>It's got to be a column vector in order that

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.860
<v Speaker 0>I can do a identity times x here with a

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.570
<v Speaker 0>row vector, I wouldn't know what to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.830
<v Speaker 0>Dimensions don't match.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.230
<v Speaker 0>So that a transpose up there is important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.800
<v Speaker 0>I did say if I, I n if you really

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.760
<v Speaker 0>make the dimension explicit, otherwise I will do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:14.500

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.670
<v Speaker 0>So where are we with time?

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.760
<v Speaker 0>There should be just what I need.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:30.240

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's useful to get into the habit of sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.470
<v Speaker 0>of knowing the names for these things if you're talking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.860
<v Speaker 0>to other people, again, especially as you're getting into more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 0>abstract things, as properties of these objects you're working with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.880
<v Speaker 0>become more important than the actual values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, again, these are rules, you might think if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 0>see something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 0>Well, why do we why do we do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 0>I mean, these are stuff that you've seen 100 times,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100]}

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.520
<v Speaker 0>probably when working with numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, you sort of know the names, but it's relatively

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 0>obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.750
<v Speaker 0>It goes back to the same thing that we had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.140
<v Speaker 0>before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.890
<v Speaker 0>We don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:31.190
<v Speaker 0>In this case, we've just defined completely new things to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.080
<v Speaker 0>work with vectors and matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 0>So we now need to think about what properties do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 0>these things have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.160
<v Speaker 0>Well, um, so we have that if I do a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.010
<v Speaker 0>times in brackets x plus y I can bracket this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.350
<v Speaker 0>out a times x plus a times y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 0>That is by no means self-evident.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.940
<v Speaker 0>Now we we actually happened to have defined the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,99,99,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.170
<v Speaker 0>vector multiplication in such a way that this works well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.050
<v Speaker 0>But we need to check that that is the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 0>And the same thing with things like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.360
<v Speaker 0>So I've now got a multiply scalar with a matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.560
<v Speaker 0>with a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.320
<v Speaker 0>Or I can multiply a scalar by a vector here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 0>or I can here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.500
<v Speaker 0>This is that I multiply the scalar with a matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.010
<v Speaker 0>first, and then multiply that by a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:23.000
<v Speaker 0>Three different types of objects are certainly not obvious at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.780
<v Speaker 0>all that something like that should hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 0>So be aware that if we're working with these things,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 0>always check that what you're thinking works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 0>You can actually do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 0>You know, get into the habit of that need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 0>prove everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 0>All right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100]}

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 0>And I think the final thing before we stop it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 0>here, um, now that we have a matrix vector multiplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 0>that sort of links it now up to what you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 0>done last week, um, this gives us a way to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 0>represent linear systems of equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um, we've got the following there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 0>We've got the system of equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think let me just take what I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100]}

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:07.210
<v Speaker 0>think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 0>I really didn't want to do anything more than to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 0>point this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 0>So I've got the system of equations that I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:24.450
<v Speaker 0>now write this, um, as a matrix vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I could now say that I take a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.900
<v Speaker 0>matrix of coefficients, and in this case just the coefficients,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.070
<v Speaker 0>not the right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.380
<v Speaker 0>For Gaussian elimination, you've copied the right hand side as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:34.590
<v Speaker 0>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.300
<v Speaker 0>So I just take the coefficients.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:41.070
<v Speaker 0>So this would be three, two, three, four, six, seven

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:41.700
<v Speaker 0>and eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.560
<v Speaker 0>Um and I can multiply this now by a vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:53.880
<v Speaker 0>of unknowns x1, x2, x3 and say this is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.920
<v Speaker 0>to the vector of right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.160
<v Speaker 0>So this is five times nine, five and nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.100
<v Speaker 0>And if I write down something like that and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:06.930
<v Speaker 0>now do the matrix vector multiplication, what I've written down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:11.250
<v Speaker 0>here, you will realise that this equation that I've written

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.790
<v Speaker 0>down here, actually it's the same thing as the system

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 0>of linear equations that I've got over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is really it's a little bit at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.870
<v Speaker 0>the moment, notational convenience because I could do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.480
<v Speaker 0>I could say, I'm going to call this matrix here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.500
<v Speaker 0>a yeah, I'm going to call this vector here x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.040
<v Speaker 0>And I'm going to call this right hand side here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.650
<v Speaker 0>For some reason right hand sides are always called b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,54,54,100,100,90]}

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.750
<v Speaker 0>Um and then what I've got here is I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[29,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.380
<v Speaker 0>write the whole linear system of equations as axe equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.010
<v Speaker 0>to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.060
<v Speaker 0>So I can just write this as one single equation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.270
<v Speaker 0>which because this vectors and matrix is actually means it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,68,100,100,50,50,100,100,100]}

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.130
<v Speaker 0>a whole system of equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.100
<v Speaker 0>But it does make this a, this is used quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.220
<v Speaker 0>often and it does make things convenient of working with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:01.550
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.570
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:03.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.260
<v Speaker 0>We're just about at the end of the lecture for

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:06.860
<v Speaker 0>today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm going to carry on tomorrow with matrix

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.460
<v Speaker 0>matrix multiplication and then a bit more talking about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, see you then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}
