<v Speaker 0>Hello.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to this lecture today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is no attendance book left for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,69,69,100,100,66,30,100,100]}

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 0>This is already the book club for, uh, the questions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 0>that we're going to see together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 0>Uh, in today's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay, on the screen, you can see a quick, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 0>some summary of the content of this week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, as I mentioned, uh, uh, yesterday with uh, last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 0>past orthogonality, Cauchy-Schwarz and the triangle inequality yesterday and today

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 0>we will have a look at matrix spaces and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 0>similarity will be next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, apologies for yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100]}

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 0>I got confused with the lectures that I'm preparing for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,90,100,100]}

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 0>next Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, today we will have a look at columns

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 0>and row spaces, image and null spaces, and the relation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 0>between the image, the column, uh, and also the rank

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 0>of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 0>Everything that you've seen in your, in your reading for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 0>today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is, uh, the same, uh, QR code

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 0>for the book club, and, uh, please tell me now

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 0>if your book club isn't working because, uh, if if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,97,71,100,100]}

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 0>it is for everyone, then, uh, let's, uh, let's start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,95,100,100]}

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 0>let's jump straight into it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, the first question that you will see in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 0>the book club, uh, is based on this matrix here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's a four by three matrix, of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the question for you is to find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 0>dimension of all the spaces of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 0>So this is a warm up exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 0>I will give you five minutes to think about how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 0>you would go about and find, uh, the dimension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 0>those spaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 0>And then, uh, I will go through the solution of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 0>the exercise together with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 0>So let me just, uh, change the book club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,98]}

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 0>You should see the first, uh the first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, the first question now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 0>This is technically a scoring question, but it was, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.289
<v Speaker 0>just the only way I could put four numerical answers

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 0>on the slider for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 0>So just treat it as, um, as, uh, um, as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 0>normal, um, as a normal numerical question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to just hide the answers for some time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 0>I invite you to take your time, discuss, discuss with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 0>your neighbour how you would go about and find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 0>dimensions of those spaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 0>I will come around, ask me any question if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 0>have some.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, I'll be back on the stage in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 0>few minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.120
<v Speaker 0>As a hint for you to sort of go about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 0>this exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 0>Of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 0>Try to remind yourself of what those spaces are, how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.140
<v Speaker 0>they are defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 0>And then from there you really have two ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.810
<v Speaker 0>You can either apply the definition, find out what the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 0>spaces, and then find the dimension of the space like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.830
<v Speaker 0>you used to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.220
<v Speaker 0>Or if you think the space has any particular property

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 0>that you remember, you can apply other results there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, we will see both both methods later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I will leave the question active for now and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 0>you can still answer it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to show the answer yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 0>Let's just go through the definition of this four spaces

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 0>very quickly together just to fix the ideas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100]}

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 0>Let's, uh, matrix let's take it to be square here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,35,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.540
<v Speaker 0>but it doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 0>The same, uh, works with non-square matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,48,85,100]}

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.730
<v Speaker 0>The column space is the subspace of N, and that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100]}

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 0>is created by the span of the columns of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 0>And you won't be surprised to know that the row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 0>space is the subspace spanned by the rows of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 0>What about the image and the null space?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.920
<v Speaker 0>Which are the the other two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 0>The image space is the set of all vectors that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.040
<v Speaker 0>can be written by applying the matrix multiplication to any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.110
<v Speaker 0>vector in the appropriate space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.460
<v Speaker 0>So if I can write x as some vector v

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.450
<v Speaker 0>multiplied on the left by the matrix A, then x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.640
<v Speaker 0>will be an element of the image.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.040
<v Speaker 0>And uh, what is the null space?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.640
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone want to come forward with that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.190
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 0>Yes yes, that's exactly right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.630
<v Speaker 0>The formalism for that is written there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.430
<v Speaker 0>But it's essentially what he just said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.610
<v Speaker 0>It's the, uh, it's the set of all vectors that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.440
<v Speaker 0>are mapped to zero by applying a.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.110
<v Speaker 0>So we now have, uh, uh, lay down the definitions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,97,94,100,100,100]}

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.430
<v Speaker 0>of what we are trying to calculate the dimension of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.700
<v Speaker 0>Let's start with the column space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.860
<v Speaker 0>The column space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.580
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.890
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a peek at the solutions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.550
<v Speaker 0>Most of you believe that the column space has dimensions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.340
<v Speaker 0>either 2 or 3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,99]}

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.430
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to hide the rest for the for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 0>the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 0>For the time being.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 0>And both are reasonable answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 0>And two is actually the correct one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.340
<v Speaker 0>It would be three because you have three columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 0>But uh, now the third column is the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 0>the previous two hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.180
<v Speaker 0>Yes, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.780
<v Speaker 0>I didn't make, um, a calculation over there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,70,100,100,55,100]}

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Speaker 0>So, um, because, uh, because the third column is, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.360
<v Speaker 0>linearly dependent on the first two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 0>Now the dimension of the column space is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.590
<v Speaker 0>the span of the first two columns, which are linearly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.520
<v Speaker 0>independent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 0>Of course, you can determine that the first two are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.910
<v Speaker 0>linearly independent by just looking at the at the last.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 0>At the last component.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 0>There's no way these two columns are linearly dependent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.600
<v Speaker 0>And so that will be the span of the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.600
<v Speaker 0>two columns dimension equal to two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we just essentially, um, answer the question by using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,62,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 0>the definition of the space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100]}

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.170
<v Speaker 0>Now, we could do the same thing with the row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:31.920
<v Speaker 0>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 0>So this this should be row.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,93]}

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:39.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, the row space is just the span of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.289
<v Speaker 0>rows, which I have written vertically, just for a matter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,54,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.099
<v Speaker 0>of space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, obviously this this, uh, vectors cannot be linearly independent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,44,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.690
<v Speaker 0>for a very obvious reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 0>Can you can anyone come up with why they can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70]}

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 0>be independent without doing any calculations?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Perfect is multiplied by minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,22,73,100,100,100]}

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 0>That.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 0>Yes, that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,38]}

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 0>That's that's exactly what I was after.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 0>That's a very simple calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 0>And fairly obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 0>Yes, but also there's four vectors in three components.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 0>And so three for vectors in R3 will never be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 0>linearly independent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 0>So there's two way we can approach this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 0>We can calculate the number of linearly independent vectors, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 0>essentially means that, uh, we, we check for, for linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 0>independence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 0>We do some calculations and we find out how many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 0>are linearly independent in there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 0>Or we can use one result that was in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,91]}

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 0>reading, uh, particularly lemma 5.4.2, which says that if A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 0>is put into a row echelon form, then the basis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.460
<v Speaker 0>of the row space will be the rows of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.340
<v Speaker 0>reduced row echelon matrix that are non-zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.290
<v Speaker 0>And this involves a slightly different kind of calculations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.960
<v Speaker 0>But if you go ahead and try to do that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.190
<v Speaker 0>I wonder, is it for a time saving measures?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41,92,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 0>Then we get the dimension of the row space is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.240
<v Speaker 0>also equal to three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.710
<v Speaker 0>There's another way of doing it because we know, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.650
<v Speaker 0>the dimension of the of the column space already, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 0>we will cross that bridge when we get there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay, next up, the image space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:37.310
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, I'm going to, uh, lay down this claim

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.560
<v Speaker 0>that the column space of A is equal to the

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.410
<v Speaker 0>And this might be to some surprise for some of

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.560

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 0>And the reason is that I do the proof in

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 0>one of the videos for the reading quiz, so you

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 0>can access the proof in the video.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.740
<v Speaker 0>It's going to me explaining it to you just online

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.730
<v Speaker 0>from Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.030
<v Speaker 0>So just keep this in the in the back pocket.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 0>And uh, obviously because those two, um, those two vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,91,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.930
<v Speaker 0>spaces are the same space, then they have a, they

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.710
<v Speaker 0>There's nothing else to say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, and finally, the null space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.240

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.660
<v Speaker 0>Well, we can just go, um, straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 0>We solve the system.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.130

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.460
<v Speaker 0>All the solutions of the system will be all the

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.930

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.320
<v Speaker 0>And depending how many parameters we will need to express

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.460
<v Speaker 0>the solutions, uh, we will get the dimension of the

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.060
<v Speaker 0>That is very similar to an exercise we did yesterday,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.570
<v Speaker 0>the one where I asked how many, um, how many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.690
<v Speaker 0>parameters I need to write down orthogonal and orthogonal vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100]}

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.130
<v Speaker 0>to a given set, and this runs much, much along

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.840
<v Speaker 0>the same intuition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:05.330
<v Speaker 0>Uh, or we can we can use another result that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.940
<v Speaker 0>you have, uh, seen in the readings, which is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.850
<v Speaker 0>rank nullity theorem, which says that the rank of A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.090
<v Speaker 0>is, uh, plus the dimension of the null space of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.360
<v Speaker 0>A is equal to n and n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.070
<v Speaker 0>Here will be the numbers of columns, and the rank

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.790
<v Speaker 0>of a was defined a very long time ago as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.360
<v Speaker 0>the number of rows in the reduced row echelon form

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.700
<v Speaker 0>that had a one pivot, uh, a nontrivial people in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,54,91,100]}

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.770
<v Speaker 0>the in the reduced row echelon form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.560
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, but you've seen in the reading that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.040
<v Speaker 0>can rewrite the rank of the matrix as the dimension

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.390
<v Speaker 0>of the column space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.750
<v Speaker 0>So essentially there's a few equivalent way we can express

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.950
<v Speaker 0>the rank nullity theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.750
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to spoil too much because one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.410
<v Speaker 0>the next exercises will be exactly about this, but essentially

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.560
<v Speaker 0>we can reread this as the dimension of the column

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.430
<v Speaker 0>space of A plus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.440
<v Speaker 0>The dimension of the null space of A is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 0>to n, and now we have calculated the dimension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.890
<v Speaker 0>the column space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 0>We know what n is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.260
<v Speaker 0>We can just bring, um, the everything to the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.140
<v Speaker 0>hand side, and we find that the dimension of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.310
<v Speaker 0>null, a, uh, is a zero dimensional subspace, and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.140
<v Speaker 0>null A will be just the zero vector, because the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.080
<v Speaker 0>set made up by the zero vector is the only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.270
<v Speaker 0>vector space of dimension zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.780
<v Speaker 0>And by the way, I want to chip in to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,95]}

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 0>a question that I've seen on Piazza being asked, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.010
<v Speaker 0>this morning, actually, I think, um, which were, which was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 0>about, uh, the vector zero specifically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:44.000
<v Speaker 0>And the question was, is the vector zero, uh, orthogonal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.420
<v Speaker 0>to everything or not or orthogonal to anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.500
<v Speaker 0>And the answer to the question is it doesn't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.280
<v Speaker 0>matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.890
<v Speaker 0>The vector zero is just the vector zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.590
<v Speaker 0>If you take this kind of product with anything, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.550
<v Speaker 0>get zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.430
<v Speaker 0>But that is a very weird scalar product because one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.360
<v Speaker 0>vector is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.930
<v Speaker 0>And so you can either decide, okay, we consider it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.250
<v Speaker 0>orthogonal to everything or not orthogonal to anything, and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.090
<v Speaker 0>doesn't really matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 0>The reason we say that it's not orthogonal to anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.450
<v Speaker 0>in this course, and this is the sort of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.360
<v Speaker 0>way that we decided to approach this issue in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.590
<v Speaker 0>course, is that it's more convenient to consider it that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.690
<v Speaker 0>way for talking about orthogonal basis, because otherwise orthogonal basis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.900
<v Speaker 0>would be defined up to the inclusion of the vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.500
<v Speaker 0>zero, which really doesn't do any favour to anyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100]}

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.530
<v Speaker 0>You have a base, you create the same base with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.410
<v Speaker 0>the vector zero, which adds nothing, and that is still

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Speaker 0>a base.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.790
<v Speaker 0>If you discard that option, then you can assume that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 0>the base is, uh, um, is uniquely defined, um, by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,94,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 0>its non-zero vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,57,100]}

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 0>So that is why, um, that is why we, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 0>have made this decision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.720
<v Speaker 0>But the complete answer is it doesn't really matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 0>So this is for question one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 0>Uh, do you have any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 0>In that case, um, the one that I just foreshadowed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 0>here, you have some statements which are all taken from

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 0>the rank nullity theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100]}

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.990

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 0>are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 0>They are equivalent version of stating the same thing, which

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 0>is the rank nullity theorem, which we just touched upon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, just a minute ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 0>This question I will only give you a couple of

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.600

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'll give you 30 more seconds to finish.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 0>In the meantime, hopefully I changed my settings so that

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.160

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 0>Fingers crossed it works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I see 60 answers, uh, that have come in.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 0>Can we reach 80 before we reveal?

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.120

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.569
<v Speaker 0>that one, three and four and there is actually, um,

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:30.740

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at the components of this, uh,

<v Speaker 0>discussed briefly in the previous question, which is that the

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 0>rank was defined in terms of the pivot of the

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.250
<v Speaker 0>row echelon matrix, but it's actually also equal to the

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 0>dimension of the column of A, and also the unproven

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.320
<v Speaker 0>things that I claimed before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100]}

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.840
<v Speaker 0>The one that you will find in the reading video

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.480
<v Speaker 0>is that the image of A is actually equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.590
<v Speaker 0>the column space of A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.840
<v Speaker 0>So what is the standard way of uh, uh, giving

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.510
<v Speaker 0>the rank the rank nullity theorem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.620
<v Speaker 0>That would be number four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.920
<v Speaker 0>And now how can we do the substitution when we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,39,100]}

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Speaker 0>know that the rank of a is also the dimension

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.980
<v Speaker 0>of the column of A?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.070
<v Speaker 0>So one is also true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.990
<v Speaker 0>And we also know that from here we can go

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.110
<v Speaker 0>down to this one here, because the dimension of the

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.180
<v Speaker 0>image of A will be equal to the dimension of

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.490
<v Speaker 0>the column of A, because they are the same space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.590
<v Speaker 0>Now what about the dimension of the null space plus

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.270

<v Speaker 0>Anyone has any idea.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.370
<v Speaker 0>Is that true?

<v Speaker 0>If you think it's true.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 0>be the dimension of the column space and the dimension

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.820
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is just the the theoretical sum up, uh,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.740

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.740
<v Speaker 0>This was the original definition of the rank.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 0>And This is the wrong theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh, let our let a be a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,96,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.940
<v Speaker 0>Then the dimension of the column is equal to the

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.040

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.720
<v Speaker 0>which we normally called.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.260
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.630
<v Speaker 0>So because of this equality also five would be one

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.470
<v Speaker 0>acceptable way of reframing the rank nullity theory.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.950

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.870

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.740
<v Speaker 0>And this time, the proof that I've chosen is this

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.800
<v Speaker 0>one here it's a let A and B be two

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.760

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.450

<v Speaker 0>same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.720
<v Speaker 0>And this works exactly as yesterday.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.340

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.390

<v Speaker 0>And, uh, I'll give you a couple of minutes and

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.520
<v Speaker 0>then we will work through the proof, um, together as

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.150

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 0>the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100]}

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, let's start to have a look at the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is a typical way that we do proofs

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 0>in mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 0>The general statement is quite complicated because there are many

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.770
<v Speaker 0>ways to move from one matrix to the other using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.190
<v Speaker 0>elementary row column, and so this method is called from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:43.510
<v Speaker 0>Latin divided tempora, which means split up in dominate.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.240
<v Speaker 0>And so if we can split up the proof into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.090
<v Speaker 0>several small cases that we can check individually, then we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.230
<v Speaker 0>have completed the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.050
<v Speaker 0>And this is exactly what we what we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:56.740
<v Speaker 0>do here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.460
<v Speaker 0>We can pass from one matrix to the other using

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.340
<v Speaker 0>elementary row operations in many times, but all of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.100
<v Speaker 0>are composition or successive applications of three main basic operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.090
<v Speaker 0>And so if we check that each operation preserves the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.540
<v Speaker 0>the row space, then no matter how many or how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.770
<v Speaker 0>varied the application of these three steps is, then we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.220
<v Speaker 0>will preserve the row space throughout the whole procedure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.470
<v Speaker 0>And so the final matrix will have the same row

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.270
<v Speaker 0>space as the starting one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,98]}

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what are the three cases?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.710
<v Speaker 0>Well, as usual, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77]}

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:33.760
<v Speaker 0>Well, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.880
<v Speaker 0>Yes, we can check all the allowed types of operations

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.510
<v Speaker 0>separately.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:44.290
<v Speaker 0>As usual, proofs are not, uh, exactly, uh, perfect in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:48.880
<v Speaker 0>terms of the, um, in terms of the necessary ordering

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.630
<v Speaker 0>of the steps, in particular, the order in which we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.450
<v Speaker 0>check the row operation, uh, doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,42,100,57,100,100]}

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.870
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and so we have a few options that were

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.370
<v Speaker 0>all exactly correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:01.210
<v Speaker 0>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, two of these, uh, two of these, uh, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,74]}

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.990
<v Speaker 0>row operations are very easy to check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.300
<v Speaker 0>The last one is a little bit more complicated, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.020
<v Speaker 0>let's do the two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.980
<v Speaker 0>Easy one first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.649
<v Speaker 0>First of all, we can swap the rows.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.480
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but that's, that's, uh, to no hurt because, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,75,93,100,98,58]}

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.710
<v Speaker 0>swapping the vectors that generate a span, uh, a span

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.870

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.020
<v Speaker 0>swapping the vectors in the span doesn't change the span,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.399
<v Speaker 0>so we're all good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100]}

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.010
<v Speaker 0>And the same is true if we multiply one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.379
<v Speaker 0>the vectors that create the span by a constant, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:36.580
<v Speaker 0>don't change the span.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.830
<v Speaker 0>That's because we can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.950
<v Speaker 0>Just the span of any set of vectors is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.220
<v Speaker 0>to the span of the rescaled vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.960
<v Speaker 0>However, we want to rescale them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.220
<v Speaker 0>So just rescaling one row here doesn't change the span

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.679
<v Speaker 0>and thus doesn't change the row space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:59.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, and now for the meaty part of the of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.110
<v Speaker 0>the of the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:07.660
<v Speaker 0>The last allowed row operation is an operation that adds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.060
<v Speaker 0>a multiple of a row to a different one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.780
<v Speaker 0>And let's let's suppose that these are the rows of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.660
<v Speaker 0>the matrix, and p and q will be obviously the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.760
<v Speaker 0>ones that interact with each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh, whoops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,71]}

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.740
<v Speaker 0>Wrong keyboard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100]}

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:30.760
<v Speaker 0>And here we apply theorem 5.1.1 which essentially does this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.180
<v Speaker 0>for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.720
<v Speaker 0>So this is another example that I've chosen this this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.620
<v Speaker 0>proof for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.980
<v Speaker 0>The hard part of this proof is actually the proof

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.970
<v Speaker 0>of something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.620
<v Speaker 0>So in mathematics we recycle previous results all the time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.680
<v Speaker 0>if we can, if you can um, if you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,70,100]}

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.420
<v Speaker 0>take a difficult concept, divide it up and then uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.350
<v Speaker 0>and then reduce it to very simple cases or cases

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.850
<v Speaker 0>that we have already proven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.180
<v Speaker 0>That's the, that's the, the best practice really.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:07.360
<v Speaker 0>So um, because we've proven, uh, theorem 5.1.1, um, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,99,100]}

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.350
<v Speaker 0>is actually, uh, not a meaty part after all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.980
<v Speaker 0>Or at least it was when we proved theorem 5.1.1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.350
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, my two takeaways from this proof is try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:24.130
<v Speaker 0>to split up and conquer and split up in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.700
<v Speaker 0>way that you can reuse and recycle previous results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that was the the spirit of this proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.180
<v Speaker 0>And well, then we can conclude we put everything together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.230
<v Speaker 0>We say, uh, any operation that we do, uh, doesn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 0>change the row space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, moving to reduce row echelon is just a succession

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,99,100,92,54,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.940
<v Speaker 0>of consecutive application of row operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.420
<v Speaker 0>But the row space is, uh, is preserved at every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:49.990
<v Speaker 0>step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.750
<v Speaker 0>And thus, if we move from A to it's reduced

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:57.640
<v Speaker 0>row echelon form by elementary row operations, we preserve the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.510
<v Speaker 0>row space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.440
<v Speaker 0>And I invite you to take your time and look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.470
<v Speaker 0>out for, uh, these types of reasoning, these type of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,97,100]}

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.250
<v Speaker 0>techniques in the proofs that you encounter in your reading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:14.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.200
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any questions about this proof, the methods,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.180
<v Speaker 0>uh, anything unclear?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's turn to the last exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.370
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, I'd like to experiment a little bit with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.680
<v Speaker 0>these exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.110
<v Speaker 0>And so this is a standard exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.990
<v Speaker 0>It's a true or false for several statements, but I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.740
<v Speaker 0>mixed the difficulty of the statements quite a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.580
<v Speaker 0>This time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 0>There are two statements that are simple or fairly simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.270
<v Speaker 0>And there are two statements that are hard or very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.310
<v Speaker 0>hard for two very different reasons.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:56.140
<v Speaker 0>And we won't only go through the statements themselves, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.590
<v Speaker 0>will also comment why they are hard and how to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.580
<v Speaker 0>to tackle them, um, if they ever come up in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.150
<v Speaker 0>the future.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:09.040
<v Speaker 0>So I believe that this is these are the statements

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.570
<v Speaker 0>you will see a triple exclamation mark on two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:13.960
<v Speaker 0>four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.430
<v Speaker 0>Those are the hard ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.710
<v Speaker 0>If you feel confident about the simple ones, you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.700
<v Speaker 0>just skip to them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.830
<v Speaker 0>If you're not confident and you just want the solution,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.260
<v Speaker 0>you can do the easy one If you want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 0>do both, you can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.440
<v Speaker 0>You can choose that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.480
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I will need at least 8 or 9 minutes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,86,86,86,86]}

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.410
<v Speaker 0>to discuss this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.110
<v Speaker 0>So you have 2 to 3 minutes to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay for this particular exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 0>I'm not, uh, too interested in exactly which statement you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 0>get wrong or right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 0>The club is just an excuse to have you think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,37,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 0>about it individually or with your colleagues for some time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 0>So let's go through the first one, which was not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.920
<v Speaker 0>one of the hard one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, the reason this is, uh, one of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 0>easy one is that it relies heavily on results that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 0>you have been given.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 0>You can apply a couple of results that you've seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.150
<v Speaker 0>in the reading, and you reach the conclusion that this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.790
<v Speaker 0>statement is indeed true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.770
<v Speaker 0>And it's not straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93]}

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.160
<v Speaker 0>So it's not an easy exercise, but you don't have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.860
<v Speaker 0>to input much of your own to solve it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 0>So let's see how we do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.130
<v Speaker 0>Uh, if A is an invertible matrix, what does it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 0>mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.310
<v Speaker 0>Well, it means that the rank of the matrix, among

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 0>other things, it means several things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.660
<v Speaker 0>It means that the determinant is non-zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.260
<v Speaker 0>It means that all the eigenvalues are non-zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.610
<v Speaker 0>It means a lot of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.350
<v Speaker 0>But among other things, it means that the, uh, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100]}

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.460
<v Speaker 0>A is invertible, and so the rank is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.000
<v Speaker 0>n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, but now, uh, because the rank is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.140
<v Speaker 0>n, that is also equal to the dimension of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.350
<v Speaker 0>row space and the column space which have the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.340
<v Speaker 0>dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.340
<v Speaker 0>Now, in principle, they don't need to be the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.210
<v Speaker 0>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.950
<v Speaker 0>But in this particular case, if we have two n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.930
<v Speaker 0>dimensional spaces in our n, they're both equal to or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,43]}

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.070
<v Speaker 0>n themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:19.480
<v Speaker 0>There are no subspaces of of dimension n in r

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.690
<v Speaker 0>n other than r n itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:23.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.780
<v Speaker 0>And so for this reason, a column and row of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100,98,100]}

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.400
<v Speaker 0>A for an invertible matrix are both equal to r

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.460
<v Speaker 0>n, and therefore they are the same space because they're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.990
<v Speaker 0>equal to the same vector space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:43.240
<v Speaker 0>As you can see, not an easy problem because there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 0>a few things to order around and make falling to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,60]}

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.420
<v Speaker 0>the right, uh, into the right place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.830
<v Speaker 0>But your input is just in the reordering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.100
<v Speaker 0>Now compare that to statement two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.990
<v Speaker 0>Now, statement two is a very hard question because instead

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:06.370
<v Speaker 0>your input here needs to be much more substantial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:07.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.800
<v Speaker 0>So this is a matrix that it's the not the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.170
<v Speaker 0>zero matrix but its square matrix is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.050
<v Speaker 0>So if we multiply a with itself we get the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.490
<v Speaker 0>identically zero matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 0>And we want to show that its rung is smaller

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,95,99,100]}

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.530
<v Speaker 0>or equal than n over half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.040
<v Speaker 0>And essentially what this exercise requires you is to build

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.730
<v Speaker 0>new knowledge from what you already know entirely new knowledge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.180
<v Speaker 0>And this is ultimately the scope of this course and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.110
<v Speaker 0>the scope of your degree.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 0>So it makes sense that this may come as quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.100
<v Speaker 0>a bit at the moment, but hopefully by the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.560
<v Speaker 0>of the course and more generally by the end of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.540
<v Speaker 0>your degree, this is the sort of things that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100]}

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.620
<v Speaker 0>will grow familiar with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.770
<v Speaker 0>So why do I say this is new knowledge?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:53.950
<v Speaker 0>Because I don't think we've spoken about how potent matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.810
<v Speaker 0>any potent matrix is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,98,100,100]}

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 0>Just a it's just the name that mathematicians have given

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.570
<v Speaker 0>to a matrix that have this property here if if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:05.470
<v Speaker 0>it's nonzero but one of its power is the zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,45,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.240
<v Speaker 0>matrix, then we call it potent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.900
<v Speaker 0>And so what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.860
<v Speaker 0>Exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.910
<v Speaker 0>What this exercise require is essentially prove a theorem for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,81,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.370
<v Speaker 0>a potent matrix, which is something that we haven't seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.460
<v Speaker 0>And the same is true and we will go about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.120
<v Speaker 0>and prove it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.370
<v Speaker 0>How do we do this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:27.820
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well, um, we want to show that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 0>Let me put everything on the screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.360
<v Speaker 0>We want to show that the image of the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.600
<v Speaker 0>A is a subset of the null space of A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.150
<v Speaker 0>That is the first step, and it will become clear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.800
<v Speaker 0>in the next slide why we do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:39.760
<v Speaker 0>How do we prove it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.150
<v Speaker 0>Well because a squared is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.280
<v Speaker 0>Then if you apply the matrix a square to any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.260
<v Speaker 0>vectors we get the vector zero because that is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.610
<v Speaker 0>the matrix zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.780
<v Speaker 0>But now a squared we can collect the terms differently.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:57.730
<v Speaker 0>And we get uh a of axe equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.050
<v Speaker 0>And now note that axe is just the way we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:06.220
<v Speaker 0>write the generic element of the image space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.740
<v Speaker 0>The image space is the set of all vectors that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.010
<v Speaker 0>can be written in exactly this form for any vectors

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.360
<v Speaker 0>x in RN.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:14.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 0>So v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 0>Here is a vector of the image.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 0>But now if I transform the vector of the image

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 0>with a if get maps to zero, so that vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,45,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 0>is also in the null space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.380
<v Speaker 0>So any vector that's in the image is also in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 0>the null, which means that the image is a subset

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.550
<v Speaker 0>of the null space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 0>Exactly what what what we wanted to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 0>And why is that useful?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.180
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is a sort of pigeonhole principle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.330
<v Speaker 0>If you have a if you've ever heard about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.750
<v Speaker 0>And if I have a subspace of another space, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.390
<v Speaker 0>dimension of the space that is contained in the other

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 0>cannot be bigger than the dimension of the space that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 0>contains it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 0>There's not enough space in the in the vector space

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 0>to contain a larger subspace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 0>Subspace with more with a greater dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 0>And now for the final, uh, for the final step,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 0>let's go in with the with the rank nullity theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 0>Now we have the dimension of the image is smaller

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 0>than the dimension of the null, but the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 0>the two is n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.200
<v Speaker 0>And so if you think about it for more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 0>a couple of seconds, this one needs to be smaller

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 0>than n halves, because if this was larger than and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 0>halves, this is also larger than enhanced.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 0>And then they can be equal to n okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 0>So this is the type of uh uh possibly the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.580
<v Speaker 0>hardest type of exercises that we can come up with,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.090
<v Speaker 0>giving you something that you can theoretically construct from what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 0>you know, but it takes some trial and error or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Speaker 0>being incredibly used to work with these types of objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 0>So no worries if you haven't seen how to solve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 0>this exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 0>That's normal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 0>I just wanted to show you what type of reasoning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 0>goes into solving an exercise that requires you a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 0>of input from your part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now, because we've done a hard exercise, let's move

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:13.980
<v Speaker 0>to Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65]}

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 0>And this is just the just what we just what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:18.030
<v Speaker 0>we have proven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually, uh, something that implies this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 0>So this is an even stronger version of this that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 0>we that we don't, uh, that we don't prove.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.820
<v Speaker 0>If a is a potent matrix, all of its eigenvalues

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.660
<v Speaker 0>are zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.290
<v Speaker 0>And you can you can get our result from this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:37.740
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.710
<v Speaker 0>You can try it in your own time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:41.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.300
<v Speaker 0>Now statement three we revert back to what we are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:45.870
<v Speaker 0>familiar with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Speaker 0>I didn't want to scare you too much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.410
<v Speaker 0>And this is a pretty straightforward application of the rank

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.670
<v Speaker 0>nullity theorem, because here essentially what I'm giving you is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.900
<v Speaker 0>uh, the dimension of the null space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.910
<v Speaker 0>You have the dimension of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:04.920
<v Speaker 0>And I'm asking you the dimension of the column, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.340
<v Speaker 0>is again using that equivalency with the rank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.530
<v Speaker 0>And then you can apply the rank nullity theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and then you get, uh, that the dimension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.370
<v Speaker 0>the column space was the rank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,95]}

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.620
<v Speaker 0>And so it was equal to three and not to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.760
<v Speaker 0>two, as I claimed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100]}

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.080
<v Speaker 0>So let's go back to the standard way of doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.800
<v Speaker 0>things here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:32.370
<v Speaker 0>And finally statement four and I marked this as difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.180
<v Speaker 0>And maybe some of you found it extremely difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.250
<v Speaker 0>And some of you find it extremely easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:42.090
<v Speaker 0>And the reason why this exercise is difficult is, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:47.100
<v Speaker 0>that, uh, it's an easy exercise in disguise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.670
<v Speaker 0>Because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:48.120
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.830
<v Speaker 0>Well, because I set a trap for it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, I put a very hard, a very hard hypothesis

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:59.640
<v Speaker 0>to work with ahead of a statement that is actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.480
<v Speaker 0>very easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:04.650
<v Speaker 0>That statement is once again related to the rank nullity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.310
<v Speaker 0>theorem, uh, in a very straightforward way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.860
<v Speaker 0>And the rank nullity theorem works for any matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.560
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter if a t a is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:13.890
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.800
<v Speaker 0>If it works for any matrix, then it will work

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.150
<v Speaker 0>also for the matrices that have this, uh uh, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 0>property here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.030
<v Speaker 0>And so how do we solve this exercise?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.970
<v Speaker 0>Well, it's actually, uh, pretty much a one liner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.550
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we can just use, uh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 0>It said the rank nullity theorem and the rank theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.160
<v Speaker 0>We can just use the rank theorem, stating that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.960
<v Speaker 0>dimension of the column is equal to the dimension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.350
<v Speaker 0>the rows, and this should be zero, not minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.160
<v Speaker 0>as a claiming.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,100]}

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:41.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.210
<v Speaker 0>So two types of difficulty we've seen here one genuine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.800
<v Speaker 0>difficulty and then one uh, one trap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:55.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh, and the takeaway from this exercise is it's true

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:59.310
<v Speaker 0>that proofs works from left to right, but don't stop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:00.810
<v Speaker 0>on the left, okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.080
<v Speaker 0>Because sometimes the left is hard and the right is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.750
<v Speaker 0>easy and you waste your time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.550
<v Speaker 0>Start decomposing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}
