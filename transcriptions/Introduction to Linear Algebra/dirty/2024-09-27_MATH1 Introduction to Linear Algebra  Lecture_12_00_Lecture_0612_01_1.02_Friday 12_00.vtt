00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.200

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so I asked you, uh, where are we?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,99,100,100,100,63,100]}

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we were on the PC.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 0>On the PC?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I ask you what the middle one there is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 0>The second row is and said that is associativity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,66,57,100,87,100]}

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, I have to say, I've only looked at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,41,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 0>last two items there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the first equation sign, of course, isn't associativity, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,64,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 0>rather you're taking the A out of the whole thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 0>so that Commutativity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100]}

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 0>That part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 0>It'll sort of both together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 0>I've only sort of glanced at it and thought, oh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 0>yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 0>Associativity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, um, what's wrong there anyhow?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 0>Once we have that, where are we for today?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 0>So here's one thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to start with something that sort of fits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 0>in yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 0>Um, but we've got to go back to that, make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 0>it slightly lighter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.210
<v Speaker 0>And, um, it is a relatively important application of matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 0>vector multiplication that we've done yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I remind you that we're talking about functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, so functions is something that you've seen as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 0>function from R to R from mapping numbers into numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so you just you just basically function as a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 0>rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 0>You have an input, you have a rule, and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 0>you have an output.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 0>So I could have for example x squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so here's my rule square the input um, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,90,95,100,100,79,100]}

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 0>I write this down as f of x, you know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,68,68]}

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, but you can obviously do something like that to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 0>anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 0>We can do something like that to for vectors, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,98,100,82]}

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 0>where we have also rules how to transform a vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 0>into somebody else and something else we tend to call

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 0>this transformations here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100]}

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 0>Uh, to some extent it's interchanged with the name with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,99,96,100,52,100,100]}

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 0>functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.470
<v Speaker 0>So that is really it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 0>But think about a transformation as a function applied to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 0>a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 0>So something that I can do to transform a vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 0>For example I could use the matrix as that yesterday

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,88,100]}

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 0>um and do a matrix vector product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 0>So I could say if I've got the vector X1X2

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40]}

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 0>here, I could transform it into the vector that I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 0>getting by multiplying this vector with the matrix from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 0>left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 0>You know, um, so I can work this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,41,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 0>We've done that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we can write this again as a transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 0>So I can say in this case, t of x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.670
<v Speaker 0>T for transformation rather than f of functions is defined

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,96,51,100,100,100]}

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.480
<v Speaker 0>by of a vector, x is defined by axe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55]}

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 0>Um, and quite often we use a notation just to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100,100]}

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.730
<v Speaker 0>indicate that this T with a subscript a, and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 0>call this the transformation that is induced by a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually very, very important application of matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 0>You can think about matrices actually as transformations to some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.240
<v Speaker 0>extent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.890
<v Speaker 0>There's a certain equivalence there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.810
<v Speaker 0>We'll come to that quite a bit later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 0>So I said here we call this or typically call

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 0>this to of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,91]}

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 0>But remember the Ta is really just a name a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 0>label that we put to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah we could call it anything else we like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100]}

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.860
<v Speaker 0>And it's the transformation induced by a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.760
<v Speaker 0>So that's an important concept that keeps coming up throughout

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.540
<v Speaker 0>this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the reason I'm doing this here is because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 0>it will come up once we do matrix matrix multiplication,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 0>um, and matrix inverses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's quite often um, um, if there's duality or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,96,100,87,100,71]}

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 0>thinking about what is the matrix, what are the properties

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 0>of the matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 0>And on the other hand, very closely related to that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 0>is thinking about what is the transformation induced by the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 0>matrix and what are the properties of this transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 0>So let's start um, I've got here, so I'll start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100]}

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 0>with a poll and saying I've got a matrix given

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 0>And what is the transformation like geometrically, what happens to

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I multiply that by that matrix there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.960

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 0>So you've got my ruler pole there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,71,100]}

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, remember that was it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 0>And I just need to go, uh, reset this from

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.380

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.660
<v Speaker 0>So do you see that?

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 0>You do see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 0>And somebody's answering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100]}

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,78]}

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 0>The results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.940
<v Speaker 0>See if we can get a few more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh, about 15 seconds left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 0>Time's up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.030
<v Speaker 0>And so vast majority says that this reflection on the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.720
<v Speaker 0>y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.830
<v Speaker 0>And indeed it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, and just to, um, for completeness, um, I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,98,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.380
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to go through this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.790
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 0>Uh, go through this in detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.920
<v Speaker 0>So if I have, um, let's work this out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 0>What is minus one 001 times X1X2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,30]}

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 0>You don't see anything?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.170
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.470
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so I can work out what happens here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and this is if you do the matrix vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.380
<v Speaker 0>multiplication, this is a minus x one and x two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,100,94,94,100,94,94]}

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.090
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so in other words, um, if I've got a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 0>sort of vector here, um, I'm going to leave the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Speaker 0>x2 component intact.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100]}

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 0>And the x1 component, I'm going to flip around the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 0>y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so it is a reflection on the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 0>So in a simple example like that you can just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 0>do that by sort of just working out what it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 0>is and then thinking what is this dramatically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, once it gets more complicated and higher dimensions, obviously

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 0>more difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 0>But we were quite a few of the things we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 0>doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 0>We deriving in the course will help you then to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 0>classify pretty much any matrix into the sort of transformation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 0>geometrically, that it induces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 0>So um, that was just, I said just hanging on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,89,43,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 0>from yesterday a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 0>Now get into, um, the matrix matrix multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 0>So, um, assuming we've now got two matrices A is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,65,97,98,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 0>M times n, b is n times k.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 0>And I say a little bit something about the dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, and so we know how to do um, how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 0>to do matrix vector multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we're just applying this Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.360
<v Speaker 0>We use pretty much the same trick as we've done

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 0>yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.190
<v Speaker 0>This matrix B that we now want to multiply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 0>What were we saying a times b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.960
<v Speaker 0>So we divide this up into its columns b1 b2

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.620
<v Speaker 0>b k.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97]}

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 0>And now we're saying that the product a times b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 0>is simply that we multiply the matrix A here with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.280
<v Speaker 0>every vector with every sort of column of the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.020
<v Speaker 0>B or the other way round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,98]}

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 0>We take every column of the matrix B in turn,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Speaker 0>multiply that with a, and then put them all together

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.560
<v Speaker 0>in a new matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.099
<v Speaker 0>So that is the matrix matrix product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.960
<v Speaker 0>Again general principle we know how to do something something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.740
<v Speaker 0>more extended.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81]}

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.000
<v Speaker 0>We'll try to we try to use what we know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.320
<v Speaker 0>in the new definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 0>So what's the size of what we've got here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this new matrix A times B, um, in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.750
<v Speaker 0>terms of, uh, rows and column dimensions, what is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.590
<v Speaker 0>size?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'm just going to do that by asking somebody

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.560
<v Speaker 0>if you've got an idea rather than a poll here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.760
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.500
<v Speaker 0>M times K yes, that is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I'm not going to go through sort of working

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.610
<v Speaker 0>that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to give you the common rule or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 0>rule of thumb or memory aid for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.890
<v Speaker 0>So if you've got an M times n matrix like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.460
<v Speaker 0>a here, uh, that you're multiplying with an n times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.770
<v Speaker 0>k matrix like B here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100]}

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, then in order for that to work the multiplication,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.800
<v Speaker 0>the middle dimensions here have to match.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,76,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 0>And then it basically cancels them out and you're left

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.240

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,60,100,100,79]}

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.380
<v Speaker 0>So that's quite useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.460
<v Speaker 0>And another reason why this rows before columns is, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.900
<v Speaker 0>quite sensible, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.380
<v Speaker 0>I'll show you that for everybody else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, now, this is to some extent arbitrary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 0>So you might ask, um, this is relatively complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.520
<v Speaker 0>I mean, apart from saying we know matrix vector multiplication,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.820
<v Speaker 0>we try to use it again, matrix addition we've just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 0>done component wise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.320
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49]}

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 0>So why why do we not just the matrix multiplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,97,100,100]}

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.610
<v Speaker 0>component wise?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the answer is um, we could do um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,49]}

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.050
<v Speaker 0>I mean, of course, nothing nothing prevents us from doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 0>And we could see whether that is useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, it just turns out that this way of doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.470
<v Speaker 0>matrix matrix multiplication is very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 0>And again, we will see, um, during the time of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 0>this course of what it is indeed useful for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's not obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's been sort of suggested that this, that this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.190
<v Speaker 0>is what we should do relatively recently, now and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 0>people have worked that out But it raises sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,85,85]}

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 0>I think an interesting question is, like our mathematicians, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,100,100]}

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 0>do we do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 0>Do we discover things or do we invent things?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 0>So it's all the mathematics out there just for us

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,47,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 0>to to uncover it or are we actively inventing stuff?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 0>And I think this very much shows we are actively

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,85,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 0>inventing stuff that might be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 0>It's not obvious that you have to do matrix matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 0>multiplication that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 0>It's just somebody suggested it turns out to be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 0>So once we've got that, I've got a number of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,67,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 0>poles here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100]}

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 0>I won't do all of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 0>I'll have a selection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100]}

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 0>I think I won't do that one there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 0>I would quite like to do this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 0>So we've seen these matrices yesterday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, and ask whether I can add them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 0>Uh, turns out none of them can, but we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 0>multiply quite a few of them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 0>So I'd like to know what you think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 0>Which of these a, b, d down to e?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 0>Which of these possibilities which of the matrices canyon will

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 0>deploy it, which you can't because it quite need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,82,100,99,100,100,66,72,86,100]}

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 0>check a couple of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 0>There is a bit more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to give you two minutes for this poll.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 0>So and I do need five choices now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 0>So just reset this in case it hadn't been.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 0>And then I'll give you a five choices poll now

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:26.170

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 0>hold.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 0>Wait wait wait wait wait I did say five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,87,92,100]}

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 0>What I did say two minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 0>I will give you two minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 0>I just have to reset the timer once it's time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,90]}

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 0>down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.170
<v Speaker 0>And another minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 0>So almost up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.750
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.440
<v Speaker 0>Eh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.400
<v Speaker 0>And quite a few.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.660
<v Speaker 0>None of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.450
<v Speaker 0>Um, the other only half a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.350
<v Speaker 0>So a is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, so all of them, I, um, I tend to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.860
<v Speaker 0>think that, um, in order to check that, I sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.230
<v Speaker 0>of take a column of the second matrix, say a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,64,84,100,69,100]}

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.990
<v Speaker 0>that's got three elements, and see if I can sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.760
<v Speaker 0>of like the matrix vector multiplication, turn its on its

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 0>side and put it over the top of the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 0>So BA that works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 0>D has three dimensions that I can put that on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,78,100,100,100,82,100]}

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 0>top of C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80]}

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 0>C has just one dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,47,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 0>The columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 0>But I can put that on top of D.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 0>And then C has one and A has three dimensional.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 0>I can put that on top of C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,99,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 0>So A does indeed work, but sort of get into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,97]}

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 0>the habit of checking whether these things work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 0>No, I think I've deleted the other one that I

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Um, so assuming that you've got, you've got matrices and

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 0>all these, the dimensions match that all these products work

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 0>and you've got a b equal to c b.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.120
<v Speaker 0>Well, if this was numbers you'd be sort of cancelling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,89,88,100,100,100,72]}

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.190

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Am I right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,99,100,100]}

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.939
<v Speaker 0>Now, this looks very, very interesting.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.050
<v Speaker 0>Pretty much equally divided between all of those options.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 0>So can I, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,93,82]}

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.589
<v Speaker 0>This is actually complicated because there isn't a direct answer.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.569
<v Speaker 0>It depends a little bit on how you understand the

<v Speaker 0>question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:26.020
<v Speaker 0>So who who says somebody who says this is true.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.510
<v Speaker 0>Can you give me can somebody give me an argument

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 0>why this is true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.570
<v Speaker 0>I've seen you first.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.810

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.720
<v Speaker 2>You will end up paying me then.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.070
<v Speaker 0>So if you multiply both sides by b minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.030
<v Speaker 0>by b inverse, uh, you can derive that.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, let me just, uh, quickly show you that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.650
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.060
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96]}

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.290
<v Speaker 0>Got too many pens here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100]}

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I start with something like if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.820

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:09.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.420
<v Speaker 0>Like this a little bit bigger, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, so I can multiply this if I half

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,88,100,100,100,100,100,96,83,52]}

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.660
<v Speaker 0>b minus one here, I can multiply both from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.810
<v Speaker 0>So I can do a b b minus one equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.600

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.960
<v Speaker 0>Um and okay I mean I need to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.650
<v Speaker 0>the order there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.270
<v Speaker 0>But that is associative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.340
<v Speaker 0>And I have here b b minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 0>That just gives us an identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 0>So this is a identity equals to see identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,35,100]}

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 0>And then we see multiplying anything with the identity keeps

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 0>the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 0>So this is a equals to c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 0>Um right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100]}

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 0>Yeah that's that's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 0>But it only works if you have B inverse.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:57.810
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 0>You need to have B inverse for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.120

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.500

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.920

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 0>Typically it works for matrices under the condition that that

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.910

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.010
<v Speaker 0>like, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:28.790
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:29.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's take it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.650
<v Speaker 0>Let's take this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.210
<v Speaker 0>I think the point I was going to make, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.670
<v Speaker 0>can actually see from your example just as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.220
<v Speaker 0>So the first column there of zeros here just maps

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,89,100,61]}

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.030
<v Speaker 0>everything to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.770
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't really matter what you're doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, and as you said, the second column there, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.110
<v Speaker 0>zero one that you have there will just extract the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,90,100,100]}

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.110
<v Speaker 0>second column from the first matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:52.680
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.660
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't matter what you put in the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.110
<v Speaker 0>column there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.790
<v Speaker 0>You could have put anything there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.490
<v Speaker 0>So, um, what you effectively doing by multiplying with another

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,32,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Speaker 0>matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.230
<v Speaker 0>If it's not invertible, you're losing information that is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.030
<v Speaker 0>able to reconstruct again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.530
<v Speaker 0>So that's why something like that doesn't always work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.430
<v Speaker 0>Good, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's a bit like I don't think I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.700
<v Speaker 0>to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 0>I think I'll actually want to go on a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 0>bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.640
<v Speaker 0>I think I want to do this one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.600
<v Speaker 0>So matrix matrix multiplication we said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.830
<v Speaker 0>And that's why I've done it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 0>We can think of a matrix or matrix vector multiplication

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.020
<v Speaker 0>as being a transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 0>There's some sort of equivalence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,98]}

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.530
<v Speaker 0>Now what is a matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 0>Matrix multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 0>That is equivalent to some sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.550
<v Speaker 0>Or that means in some sense that we're chaining to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,96,100]}

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.870
<v Speaker 0>transformations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 0>So if you've got the matrix A here we say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 0>to is the transformation that is induced by it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 0>And we've got another matrix B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.870
<v Speaker 0>And we say TB is the transformation induced by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 0>So what transformation will be induced by a b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 0>And I've just given those transformations there in a slightly

<v Speaker 0>You have two choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 0>And I just need to get a two choices.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 0>This is just there's just two choices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 0>Two choices are good eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,94,65]}

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 0>We got a bit longer to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:39.410

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.540
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't give me a timer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 0>I have to do this manually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Um.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.440
<v Speaker 5>Right?

<v Speaker 5>10s.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.900
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, this is interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.010
<v Speaker 0>The majority thinks B.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.630
<v Speaker 0>Actually, a is correct.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:22.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, there's not much I can give you to do

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.540
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 0>It's just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.830
<v Speaker 0>You are right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 0>There's something confusing there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.010
<v Speaker 0>At some point, the thing that looks the other way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,68,56,86,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.510
<v Speaker 0>round than what you think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,94,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 0>But it's not this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 0>So just to just to recapture what is going on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 0>So I mean, to some extent it's just obscure notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 0>You know, the question is I've got this to train

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 0>with TB applied to X, what do we actually mean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 0>by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 0>And TR trained by TB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,45,100,100]}

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 0>What we actually mean by that is simply that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 0>say this is to of t a of TB of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,56,98,100,92,100]}

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 0>x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 0>Um so that's, that's simply what it is to of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 0>TB of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 0>And then if I have a vector x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,48,97,100,100]}

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.310
<v Speaker 0>So that means if I evaluate this I first of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100,100]}

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 0>all apply the matrix and multiply by the matrix B

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 0>from the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 0>And then I multiply with a matrix A from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 0>left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.680
<v Speaker 0>So this gives me a b x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 0>So that's the transformation induced by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.920
<v Speaker 0>Um now the thing where it does become confusing is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,77,97,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.780
<v Speaker 0>that you think so what does this what does this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 0>So I've got to make a vector x here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, so if I do want to evaluate this to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.580
<v Speaker 0>of TB of x, I'm actually evaluating from the middle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.720
<v Speaker 0>outside.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.140
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.200
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not doing first hire and then TB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,38,100,100,100]}

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.360
<v Speaker 0>I'm doing first TB and then to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 0>So I first of all applying TB to this here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.850
<v Speaker 0>Um so this will give me the matrix B x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 0>Um and I think what we've had here, this was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 0>living in our case space, uh, this is living in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 0>MB space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 0>And then I'm doing the TR transformation here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 0>Um, that now will give me a b x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is living in r n space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,94,100]}

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I can do everything at the same time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 0>here and this transformation here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to call to change with TB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,73,100,100]}

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 0>So, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh, how does TB map X from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 3>K to M.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.980
<v Speaker 0>So b is an n times k matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:30.940
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.700
<v Speaker 0>So I have to multiply the k vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.310
<v Speaker 0>And it would give me an n vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.020
<v Speaker 0>And I've done right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86]}

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.940
<v Speaker 0>I've got my M's and the ends the wrong way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.270
<v Speaker 0>round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:43.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:44.920
<v Speaker 0>All right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100]}

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.370
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.280
<v Speaker 0>You're right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.300
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.580
<v Speaker 0>So the confusing thing was something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.540
<v Speaker 0>Is this operation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100]}

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.030
<v Speaker 0>If I see if I see a B times X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.910
<v Speaker 0>or to apply to TB of x, which operation do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.840
<v Speaker 0>I do first?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.700
<v Speaker 0>Well, um, that's the thing that you have to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.430
<v Speaker 0>about, um, how this works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100]}

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.650
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.530
<v Speaker 0>So there is sort of matrix matrix multiplication.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, the other big topic that we're doing today is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.030
<v Speaker 0>inverses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, and give you a little bit of a motivation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.530
<v Speaker 0>I'll just put this on both sides that, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 0>You all see this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, I am there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,83]}

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:38.240
<v Speaker 0>So, um, if I had an equation like that, a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 0>x equals to B for an A, which isn't equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.710
<v Speaker 0>to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, in numbers, what would you do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.170
<v Speaker 0>You know, divide divide by a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:51.440
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.670
<v Speaker 0>You just divide by a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 0>So I would just say I can divide through by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.560
<v Speaker 0>a and then I get x equals to b over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:57.800
<v Speaker 0>a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43]}

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.290
<v Speaker 0>Now we've seen that a linear system of equations um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.370
<v Speaker 0>something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 0>We've seen yesterday that we can write this in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.830
<v Speaker 0>form axe equals to b which formally looks the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.760
<v Speaker 0>as we've got there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, so how do we do proceed there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.920
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, if we divide by a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,64,97,100,100,100]}

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:21.890
<v Speaker 0>Times the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:22.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.240
<v Speaker 0>So very important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.590
<v Speaker 0>You never divide by a Via matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,42,72]}

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 0>Just never.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 0>Even if you think while dividing by a matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 0>the same thing as having an inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 0>And we do have inverses, just don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the reason is simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.190
<v Speaker 0>So if I write, if I were to write something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.410
<v Speaker 0>like, uh, in this case this is the other way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,50,56,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.270

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.090
<v Speaker 0>And I say, oh, well, this is the same by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,98]}

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,100]}

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.600
<v Speaker 0>Well, what do I mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.250
<v Speaker 0>Is this b minus one times a or is this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.800
<v Speaker 0>a times b minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100]}

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.200
<v Speaker 0>Well uh, those in general are not the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.770
<v Speaker 0>Matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.850
<v Speaker 0>Matrix multiplication doesn't commute, so those are not the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.150
<v Speaker 0>thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.880
<v Speaker 0>I have to decide what I want, what I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.720
<v Speaker 0>this to mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.390
<v Speaker 0>And that's why this this one would be ambiguous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, I wouldn't know what it means.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.650
<v Speaker 0>So don't don't do that here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, Always decide on one of those two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you need to do something like, um, like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.790

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100]}

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 0>So, um, back to where we were.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we can't divide three by a, we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,97,100,55,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 0>to use inverses instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100]}

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, so, um, just back to the drawing board, but,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 0>uh, the answer, the right answer already came from there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 0>Um, so in real numbers, rather than dividing through by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60,100]}

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 0>a, we can of course multiply by the inverse by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 0>the reciprocal there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 0>Um, and we can do the same thing in linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 0>systems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 0>So um, what does this mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'll do it this way round.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,96,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 0>Same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.110
<v Speaker 0>We've got a linear system.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.630
<v Speaker 0>We realised we can write this as a matrix vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 0>equation there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, we say we can multiply by a minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 0>So, um, let's just have a look at this matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.450
<v Speaker 0>You know, And try to work out what this is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,42,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.510
<v Speaker 0>So what is B times a?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.700
<v Speaker 0>And I probably before I do this here in just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,39,77]}

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.550
<v Speaker 0>three I'll give you a couple of seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.030
<v Speaker 0>Really.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.210
<v Speaker 0>Well I'm not doing anything where you can do this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.360
<v Speaker 0>in your head or write this down and just check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.290
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:18.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.420
<v Speaker 0>Anybody has got an answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It's the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,84,100]}

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 0>Matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.540
<v Speaker 0>It is the identity matrix, indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.000
<v Speaker 0>So let's just check a few things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.630
<v Speaker 0>So first element here I'd have to use that column

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.110
<v Speaker 0>and that row and take the take the scalar product.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.140
<v Speaker 0>So three times five is 15 two times two is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.500
<v Speaker 0>four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.440
<v Speaker 0>That is 19 together divided by 19 is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,43,100]}

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:46.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh next one here minus two times five plus plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.450
<v Speaker 0>two times five is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.370
<v Speaker 0>And the others work the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:50.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.990
<v Speaker 0>So I've got zero one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.090
<v Speaker 0>So indeed this is the identity matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.920
<v Speaker 0>Um so so this is the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.080
<v Speaker 0>I'll come to that in a, I come to that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.620
<v Speaker 0>in a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, strictly speaking actually at the moment, our definition of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.640
<v Speaker 0>inverse, I think I have that in a couple of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.000
<v Speaker 0>slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.120
<v Speaker 0>But the definition of inverse that we had so far,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.750
<v Speaker 0>uh, required us to do A times B as well

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.120
<v Speaker 0>and check that one, that that also gives the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.950
<v Speaker 0>Just to make you aware, I'm not doing that at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.550
<v Speaker 0>the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.970
<v Speaker 0>I'll have a justification for that later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, but if I have this matrix B now, what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.170
<v Speaker 0>I can do is if I want to solve axe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.260
<v Speaker 0>equals to B, I can multiply everything from the left

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:40.540
<v Speaker 0>by b, um, and then realise that the left hand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.500
<v Speaker 0>side of what I've written there, um, b times axe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.080
<v Speaker 0>I can, I can use associativity, I can move the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.930
<v Speaker 0>brackets, that is ba times x b a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,39]}

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 0>I've just worked out as the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 0>So that's the identity matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54,92,100,94]}

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.030
<v Speaker 0>It is x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,98,100]}

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.500
<v Speaker 0>So I've got a formula there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.200
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I've got a formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.710
<v Speaker 0>Um I know that a x is equal to b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.820
<v Speaker 0>Um so I've got a formula that x equals b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.440
<v Speaker 0>times the right hand side of my system now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.230
<v Speaker 0>So I can now go and just work this out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.679
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:20.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, the matrix vector multiplication and multiplication by this scalar

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49]}

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.340
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.830
<v Speaker 0>And that gives me x equals one one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what I've just done is I solve this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.429
<v Speaker 0>system of equations without using Gaussian elimination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.790
<v Speaker 0>That bit surprise you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39,82,87,99]}

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.360
<v Speaker 0>Uh, thing, of course, is that I've made up this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,83,32,62,100]}

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.080
<v Speaker 0>matrix B there, um, which are sort of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,58,100,100]}

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.669
<v Speaker 0>Well, you've read in in Nicholson.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,86,84,95,93,58]}

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:43.889
<v Speaker 0>I haven't told you how to find that, but of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.080
<v Speaker 0>course you do find it through Gaussian elimination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Speaker 0>So, um, it's, um, you haven't really won anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,48,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.090
<v Speaker 0>It's just an interesting observation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.350
<v Speaker 0>If you have an inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.780
<v Speaker 0>Uh, you don't have to do Gaussian elimination.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.560
<v Speaker 0>You can just solve the system, um, by multiplying it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so I think I've got a definition here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.040
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, we have this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100]}

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.450
<v Speaker 0>So a matrix is an inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,100]}

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:11.730
<v Speaker 0>If we have able to um, both BA and a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100,91]}

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.350
<v Speaker 0>b are equal to the identity matrix, um, then it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.000
<v Speaker 0>called an invertible matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.870
<v Speaker 0>I denote this by minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, and just to remind you, you might be used

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 0>that for numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.870
<v Speaker 0>If I have a minus one, that's just another way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.590
<v Speaker 0>of writing one over a in this case don't divide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.610
<v Speaker 0>by matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 0>So um, do not write that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:38.620
<v Speaker 0>Um, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.070
<v Speaker 0>And indeed what we have there is the inverse, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,98,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.740
<v Speaker 0>this matrix P that we had earlier was the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,47,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:46.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.690
<v Speaker 0>So just a couple of things on inverses that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.170
<v Speaker 0>had before, I sort of go back to doing something,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.670
<v Speaker 0>uh, for a few matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.050
<v Speaker 0>We just know the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.920
<v Speaker 0>For example, if you have a diagonal matrix, um, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.220
<v Speaker 0>can just invert every element on the diagonal and that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.390
<v Speaker 0>gives us the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.990
<v Speaker 0>This strictly only works for diagonal matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.060
<v Speaker 0>If you've got any off diagonal elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, that doesn't work anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:12.730
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34]}

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.270
<v Speaker 0>Um, also for 2 or 3 matrices, Is there an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,94,94,80,83,34,88]}

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.620
<v Speaker 0>explicit formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.170
<v Speaker 0>And you will see if I have if you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.690
<v Speaker 0>a look at my my b there, my A there,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,63,100,100,90]}

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.550
<v Speaker 0>you will see that this is one over 19.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,63,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.550
<v Speaker 0>And swapping the elements about a little bit is exactly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.860
<v Speaker 0>what comes out of this formula here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.100
<v Speaker 0>I have to say, I don't remember that formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.170
<v Speaker 0>I know that it exists forever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

<v Speaker 0>Knitted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49]}

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.840
<v Speaker 0>I look it up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.890
<v Speaker 0>There are corresponding formulae for higher dimensions, but they get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 0>pretty unwieldy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, so tend to not to be used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.810
<v Speaker 0>I should point out this thing in the denominator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:51.470
<v Speaker 0>There is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.900
<v Speaker 0>You will later see this is called the determinant of

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.170
<v Speaker 0>the matrix a um, it's a very useful thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.370
<v Speaker 0>And what it is, what it does determine is indeed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.590
<v Speaker 0>whether a matrix is invertible or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:04.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, and the determinant, unlike this formula, the determinant is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.580
<v Speaker 0>very useful in higher dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.600
<v Speaker 0>And also having it as a criteria of whether a

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.890
<v Speaker 0>matrix is invertible or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 0>So what can go wrong?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I'm claiming this matrix T is not invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I do this in the following manner.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:33.690
<v Speaker 0>They say let's calculate those two matrix vector products there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 0>And again while I'll write down here um I'll do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,81,100]}

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 0>Do this together with you while I write down the

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, here, I encourage you to try to work this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.520
<v Speaker 0>out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.690
<v Speaker 0>So, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.690
<v Speaker 0>Anybody got an answer?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.200
<v Speaker 0>714.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 0>Yes, that's what I got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.910
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then for the next one, let's do this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 0>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 0>Uh, minus two and three times one, three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 0>So this is a minus two plus three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's a seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 0>And this is a minus four plus 18.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 0>This is also a 14.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:57.940
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.280
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Speaker 0>In view of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.580
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what then is the solution to this system of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.450
<v Speaker 0>equations?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47]}

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.910
<v Speaker 0>Two answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.800
<v Speaker 0>Actually, not just two answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.010
<v Speaker 0>You'll know from what you've done last week that if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.710
<v Speaker 0>you've got two answers, you've got infinite, infinitely many.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,60,100,100]}

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.970
<v Speaker 0>So any combination of those two will also be an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:26.510
<v Speaker 0>answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.340
<v Speaker 0>But we have several answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:34.400
<v Speaker 0>Now, if this here where an invertible matrix, if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.000
<v Speaker 0>did have an A minus one, we could just write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.670
<v Speaker 0>down the solution to the system as a minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.540
<v Speaker 0>times b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.600
<v Speaker 0>So that would just give us a single answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.760
<v Speaker 0>But we have two answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.190
<v Speaker 0>So by contradiction this cannot be an invertible matrix that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.910
<v Speaker 0>we have out there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,68,100]}

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 0>Let me just check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.510
<v Speaker 0>I've got ten minutes or so.

<v Speaker 0>Where am I and what did I want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Speaker 0>Um, and what was important to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.810
<v Speaker 0>No, I think we're pretty much we're good on time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.230
<v Speaker 0>We're very good on time, I think so, of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:12.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.820
<v Speaker 0>In order to check, I should say that in order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.640
<v Speaker 0>to check whether it's invertible or not, you can have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.020
<v Speaker 0>a look at this determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, a times D is six and b times C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.240
<v Speaker 0>is also six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.650
<v Speaker 0>So determinant is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.170
<v Speaker 0>This is not an invertible matrix.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:28.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.350
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.960
<v Speaker 0>Right I might as well give you that one here

<v Speaker 0>a Po.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,37]}

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.800
<v Speaker 0>So if I've got an invertible matrix and a scalar

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.440

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.380
<v Speaker 0>the scalar times k, is that invertible.

<v Speaker 0>True or false.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.550
<v Speaker 0>I think you've seen the countdown on your app or,

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.210

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 0>You can check it by multiplying things together and see

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 0>whether that works.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so I'm not I do this in a second.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.450
<v Speaker 0>I'll do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I've got a couple of properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.990

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.660

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.600
<v Speaker 0>If I take the inverse and invert that again, I'll

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.340

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 0>Just to summarise that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,97]}

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 0>Now Nicholson then has this monster theorem there, the inverse

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 0>theorem 2.4.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if you skip that because it just looks

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.080
<v Speaker 0>too long.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 0>I encourage you to really do look at it because

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.160
<v Speaker 0>this is very, very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.430
<v Speaker 0>Now, um, so it'll tell us, I want to say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,67,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.390
<v Speaker 0>two things about it.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.730
<v Speaker 0>Tell us a few things that are equivalent.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, so what does it mean that a matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 0>invertible?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.060
<v Speaker 0>It means, for example, that a homogeneous system has only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.450
<v Speaker 0>a unique solution, which is the trivial solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:36.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, it also tells us I'll go to for first,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,93,100]}

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.260
<v Speaker 0>um, that any system of equations with that matrix has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,93,100,100]}

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.900
<v Speaker 0>at least one solution, no matter what the right hand

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.680
<v Speaker 0>side is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.720
<v Speaker 0>So, um, it tells us under three that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[30,96,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.560
<v Speaker 0>carry the matrix to the identity matrix for elementary row

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.520
<v Speaker 0>operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.330
<v Speaker 0>Um, we've seen that that because the rank in that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.110
<v Speaker 0>case, if it's the identity of the row operations that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:04.320
<v Speaker 0>has rank N, so it's a full rank matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 0>Um, and it says the existing matrix such as AC

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,79,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.320
<v Speaker 0>is I n that a times C is the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,52,52,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 0>So the thing that I want to, as I say,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 0>these things are very useful to, to have in mind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 0>and indeed will later get another inverse theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 0>I want to point out the way that Nicholson proves

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 0>this is quite, is quite, um, interesting because it says

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,79,100,100,97,100]}

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.300
<v Speaker 0>everything of this is equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:36.260
<v Speaker 0>And he proves that by saying from one follows, two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.760
<v Speaker 0>from two follows, three from 3 or 4 from 4

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,67,67,67,100,80]}

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.220
<v Speaker 0>or 5, and then from five follows one to complete

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:43.940
<v Speaker 0>the circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Speaker 0>And if you proved all of that, you can pretty

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.470
<v Speaker 0>much go from anything to anything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.220
<v Speaker 0>So it's an interesting and useful proof technique to keep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.000
<v Speaker 0>that in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.430
<v Speaker 0>I encourage you to look through all of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.110
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:59.120 --> 00:44:59.870
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:00.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.390
<v Speaker 0>And, um, I just want to point out the step

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 0>from 5 to 1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.770
<v Speaker 0>So we've got a matrix that AC that we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,89,65,100,100]}

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.600
<v Speaker 0>a matrix C and we know A times C is

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.870
<v Speaker 0>the the the the identity matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 0>Why do we still need to prove that then A

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 0>is invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 0>Is that not the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 0>What remains to be proven there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 0>Somewhere in the middle there is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to prove that C times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,93,98,98,100,97,98]}

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 0>Invert from what we've had so far about identity would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[12,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 0>have to move proof the other direction as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 0>Now this tells us it's part of the equivalent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 0>So this theorem tells us actually we don't have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 0>do the other direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 0>It comes for free.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.860
<v Speaker 0>So that's that's interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 0>So the last thing I want to do, what I

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 0>skipped over here is, um, how do we get inverses?

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, and I think this is from Nicholson.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 0>Um, so it's a matrix inversion algorithm.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.350

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.810

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.420
<v Speaker 0>find an inverse of a matrix, say, um, the matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,91,100,100]}

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.180
<v Speaker 0>that I had earlier, where where did I have that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:26.890
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.030
<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100]}

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.480
<v Speaker 0>Well, my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Matrices, if I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:32.860
<v Speaker 0>Want them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.670
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so we have this matrix A that we had,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:41.020
<v Speaker 0>it was three minus two, two five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.850
<v Speaker 0>Uh, there we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.950
<v Speaker 0>So if I want to have the inverse of that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.620
<v Speaker 0>uh, what I do is I do Gaussian elimination and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.260
<v Speaker 0>I do Gaussian elimination with two right hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70]}

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.880
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just using one zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.770
<v Speaker 0>But I also use zero one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,61,100,100]}

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, other words on the right hand side I just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.110
<v Speaker 0>put the identity matrix in the correct dimension.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.550
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then I go through Gaussian elimination and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.780
<v Speaker 0>go through a glass formation trying to get this to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.280
<v Speaker 0>reduce excellent form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,96]}

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.850
<v Speaker 0>And I've just known that if I've got reduced, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.450
<v Speaker 0>this is an invertible matrix, my reduced reduced row echelon

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.120
<v Speaker 0>form is actually the identity will look like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.060
<v Speaker 0>And this one will just end up being a minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:20.720
<v Speaker 0>one here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.530
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that might look like pure magic to you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 0>at the moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, I will go into quite a bit detail why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.760
<v Speaker 0>that works next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, if you think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:35.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.900
<v Speaker 0>Uh, no, I just make this thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.540
<v Speaker 0>If you think about what we're doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.750
<v Speaker 0>So a times B, we want a half as equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,38,75,40,100]}

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.010
<v Speaker 0>to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.400
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.900
<v Speaker 0>Uh, now we defined A times B as this being

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.110
<v Speaker 0>a times the first column of a times a times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:58.100
<v Speaker 0>this the or the other columns of B by doing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.480
<v Speaker 0>that matrix in that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, and if we, um, if this would be equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:06.450
<v Speaker 0>to the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.080
<v Speaker 0>The identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.630
<v Speaker 0>We can also take apart into its columns.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100]}

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.080
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:12.210
<v Speaker 0>So this is exactly what we've done there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Speaker 0>So what we're doing here, we really need to just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.450
<v Speaker 0>solve n linear systems of equations to find the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:23.700
<v Speaker 0>And that is exactly, uh, what this thing here is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.240
<v Speaker 0>doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:28.110
<v Speaker 0>So as I say on the on the reading quiz

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 0>on Monday, I work, I think, through three by three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.010
<v Speaker 0>examples in detail and we will get next week much

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.120
<v Speaker 0>more sort of insight of how these things work and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.960
<v Speaker 0>why they work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:40.650
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:40.980
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.080
<v Speaker 0>That's it for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.770
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I should say somebody came in and said, can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.900
<v Speaker 0>you please leave through that door?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that because in order for some fire regulations or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:58.440
<v Speaker 0>so, uh, that has stairs, if you don't fancy the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.410
<v Speaker 0>stairs for some reason to go up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}
