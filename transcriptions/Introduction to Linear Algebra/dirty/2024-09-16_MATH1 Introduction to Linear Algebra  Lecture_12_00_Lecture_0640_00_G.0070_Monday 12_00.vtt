00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.300

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.910

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 0>and then Cordelia and Eric will do the more exciting

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 0>a while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 0>My specialisation is applied mathematics, particular optimisation and they are

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 0>optimisation under uncertainty, but that will not very much impact

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.770

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 0>the more applied side or where this might be useful

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 0>in applied mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 0>This semester I'm doing Ila as the only course, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 0>next semester I am teaching a fourth year MSC course

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.440

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so on the course will be we have ten

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 0>weeks of material, which is all in this textbook here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 0>And we'll be working through some of the topics in

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 0>We can't cover everything in these ten weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 0>After the ten weeks, we have one week of revision

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 0>of the material before the final assessment, which I say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.570

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 0>I sort of organise, we organise them by topic and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,44,100,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 0>every topic will roughly run Wednesday to Wednesday during the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 0>So here's a rough breakdown of what you ought to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.350

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 0>do at what point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 0>So at the start, there's some pre-reading.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 0>Um, and it'll be like, um, give us your opinion

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 0>on that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 0>We'll have a statistic on how many people have answered

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 0>what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 0>And then discuss with your neighbour with somebody, whether you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 0>think that what you have, what the right answer may

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,88,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 0>be, what what the answer is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 0>So it's very interactive and it's mandatory that you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 0>prepared the material before the lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 0>Um, all this the reading guide and all this materials

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 0>and what we call stack, um, this is part and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 0>I'm just going to show that to you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is part of the course website.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I think this should come up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 0>On that side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 0>So this is roughly what you see the course website

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 0>as you see it, I see I can make it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,50,96,100,100,100]}

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 0>slightly bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 0>And there's an item there that says online assessment quizzes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 0>and lecture material.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 0>Um, that is stack.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 0>So if you go on there, um, you'll have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 0>few more information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 0>Again I see whether I can get it slightly larger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,98,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 0>So there's the course textbook for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 0>But if you scroll down you'll have the reading guide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 0>down here for week one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 0>So that is what you should start to prepare to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 0>read through mortality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88]}

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 0>Which part of the book you should read through before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.760
<v Speaker 0>the Thursday and Friday lectures?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 0>Um, I should say, if you're doing the reading, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.070
<v Speaker 0>should read actively, not just scan the whole thing, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.120
<v Speaker 0>really try to understand the material as well as you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 0>can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.040
<v Speaker 0>That takes some time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,87,100,100]}

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 0>Um, and probably takes some practice to get there, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,88,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.660
<v Speaker 0>we'll try to help you through that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.430
<v Speaker 0>Um, the lectures itself are Thursday Fridays over in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 0>Swan Lecture Theatre.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,83]}

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Speaker 0>Slightly bigger because we've got such a large class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.760
<v Speaker 0>This is only half of the student.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.140
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is double taught.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,80,93]}

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.170
<v Speaker 0>So every lecture will be at 12, and we're repeating

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,96,100]}

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.370
<v Speaker 0>it again at one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, please stick to your timetable, because, you see, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.560

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, I did say about this flipped interactive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.110
<v Speaker 0>I give you I give you an example of a

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.200
<v Speaker 0>poll in a second, um, based on the reading for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.710
<v Speaker 0>that work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 0>And really it is the whole idea of the whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 0>thing, that it is interactive, that the students are there,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.560

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 0>So although everything is recorded, this is mainly done for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 0>revision purposes.

<v Speaker 0>poll.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.720

<v Speaker 4>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Is that working?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Hello?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 2>So we've rejigged all the text so we can start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,75,77,100,100,48,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.730
<v Speaker 2>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Um, so this is, that's that's the boring what the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 2>course is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 2>So this is the less boring what the course is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh, well, actually, from a mathematical point of view.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,47,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>So what is linear algebra?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Um, firstly, who am I?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a good place to start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I am also new in Edinburgh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I started two weeks ago so we can all get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.290
<v Speaker 2>lost on campus together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Um, feel free to kind of say hi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 2>If you're lost, I might be able to help.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Um, unlike these two, I am a pure mathematician.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I come from a geometric point background.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 2>So, um, I will be bringing more of that side

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>of maths into it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And you will see me again next term, where I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>will be teaching you a lot of proofs and problem

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 2>solving.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully I'm not terrible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Um, I also like making mathematical models, so I will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.580
<v Speaker 2>come when I'm in my weeks and come and wave

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.440
<v Speaker 2>weird maths models that I spend too much of my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.960
<v Speaker 2>free time making, in the hope that it might help

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you understand some stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Um, if you ever want to come play with them,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.780
<v Speaker 2>come find my office, I have loads.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Um, so what is linear algebra?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Briefly, the answer is vectors and matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Who has seen vectors before?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Hands up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Should hopefully be nearly all of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Keep your hand up if you have also seen matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh, also, most of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 2>That's good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Um, so that is essentially what we're studying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 2>But let's go into a bit more detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Um, hopefully we've all seen algebra before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 2>You've got equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99]}

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 2>And uh, solving some equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100]}

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh, if you're linear, then that means an unknown, some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.560
<v Speaker 2>coefficient, often a coefficients a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,98,100,100]}

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>In this course it will nearly always be a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>But it could be anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 2>It could be, um, some other kind of coefficient, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>we'll see later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh, so it's not two coefficients times together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing going to be x squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no x is y's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,52]}

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no signs causes or anything like that happening to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.220
<v Speaker 2>the variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Um signs causes squareds and whatnot can happen in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 2>coefficient but not to the variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Our variable is just an x sitting there by itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Um, so linear algebra is trying to solve linear equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Putting those two things together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to solve equations that are linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 2>That is what it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100]}

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So for example you cannot see um, there was an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100]}

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 2>example on the bottom of this board that we will.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 2>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Some linear equations that you might have solved before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,92]}

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully not those ones in things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,45,100]}

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Um, but but those are some linear equations of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 2>type we will be solving.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 2>So basically it's a lot like school maths that you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.900
<v Speaker 2>solved equations like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.990
<v Speaker 2>You've probably been solving them for a good decade now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Um, so we're going to keep solving those, but we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.360
<v Speaker 2>going to make them a bit harder in two ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.490
<v Speaker 2>We're going to either add more coefficients, we're going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.650
<v Speaker 2>move into higher dimensions, more abstract things, um, or look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.250
<v Speaker 2>at more kind of abstract objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.450
<v Speaker 2>So instead of coefficients being numbers, and instead of trying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.070
<v Speaker 2>to solve for a number, we might try to solve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.840
<v Speaker 2>for another mathematical object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Um, that's happening maybe a bit later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's one way of viewing linear algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Just essentially equations like that, which hands up if you've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.950
<v Speaker 2>got an idea where to start with solving something like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 2>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's where we're starting, hopefully somewhere nice and safe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.860
<v Speaker 2>and kind of within most people's familiar ballpark.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Um, everything's linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Um, and we can write this as a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.400
<v Speaker 2>People are nodding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.460
<v Speaker 2>People are happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 2>We can write this as a matrix of coefficients, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 2>is kind of a similar way of writing matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,78]}

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Putting them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100]}

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Again, people are nodding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Um, and we can find a systematic way to solve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.180
<v Speaker 2>any system of equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.310
<v Speaker 2>In fact, that's what we're doing in week one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Hooray!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.360
<v Speaker 2>But that's just week one, and there's a whole nother

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.140
<v Speaker 2>nine weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.480
<v Speaker 2>So that is the kind of longer list of what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.980
<v Speaker 2>we are doing this term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Um, presumably the words get more and more unknown the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.560
<v Speaker 2>longer you go down that list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry, it'll be fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100]}

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.990
<v Speaker 2>We'll go through it slowly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.790
<v Speaker 2>So the next thing on the list is a vector

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.360
<v Speaker 2>space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Um, if I give you a vector three minus five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.730
<v Speaker 2>two, that could be many things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.360
<v Speaker 2>So it could be a point in three dimensional space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Three in the x direction, minus five in the y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.570
<v Speaker 2>two in the z.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.300
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what most people are familiar with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.810
<v Speaker 2>But it could be other things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>It could be a bit of statistical data or the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.240
<v Speaker 2>properties of an object, maybe its colour, for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,51,81,100,100]}

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Or it could be something even more abstract.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It could be a polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I could say, well, in relation instead of x, y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,45,99,99,99]}

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and z, I could say one x and x squared,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.540
<v Speaker 2>or I could go even more abstract.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.030
<v Speaker 2>And instead of x, y z I could have sine

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.430
<v Speaker 2>x, sine two x and sine three x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I said there was no not going to be any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.170
<v Speaker 2>functions with variables, but there they are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.000
<v Speaker 2>We're not solving for them though.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.050
<v Speaker 2>So all of this depends if I give some if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.840
<v Speaker 2>some mathematician anywhere in the department come up to you

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.060
<v Speaker 2>and gives you a vector, they might not just be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.980
<v Speaker 2>talking about a vector in three dimensional, you're talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,97,95,100,100]}

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:09.140
<v Speaker 2>something much more general, depending on their context, the conventions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.960
<v Speaker 2>they have, or to use the kind of proper maths

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.950
<v Speaker 2>lingo, their vector space and the particular basis they're using.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.360
<v Speaker 2>So we'll look into that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Um, but we won't jump into that more abstract side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.580
<v Speaker 2>To begin with, we'll start with nice, familiar 2D and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 2>3D space that you've been doing for years and years.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully we all have a basic grasp of two dimensional

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 2>geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Um, you can draw it on a sheet of paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh, you're probably got some familiarity with three dimensional stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a lot more of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Um, we will have demonstrations and I will show you

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:49.790
<v Speaker 2>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.990
<v Speaker 2>We will all show you things.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.660
<v Speaker 2>And I might occasionally come and wave some things in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Um, and we will get much better at visualising kind

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.060
<v Speaker 2>of abstract, three dimensional space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.490
<v Speaker 2>We can't do four dimensional space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Our brains aren't wired for it, so we can't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 2>visualise anything after that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Um, but what we will do is develop these methods

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.510
<v Speaker 2>for two and three dimensional space that can then be

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.920
<v Speaker 2>extended to four, five, six, seven, 2,000,000,000,004.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Um, if you really wanted to solve some 2,000,000,000,004 dimensional

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 2>problem, I wouldn't recommend it without a computer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Um, but this is the importance of proof that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>can take a kind of concept we have developed in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,83,100,90]}

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 2>two and three dimensions, and generalise it up to something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.030
<v Speaker 2>that allows us to solve something ridiculous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Um, so that's kind of the other side of linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.780
<v Speaker 2>algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.660
<v Speaker 2>We can solve mechanisms of vectors and matrices problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.880
<v Speaker 2>We can solve these linear equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>We can develop the theory behind it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.520
<v Speaker 2>And that allows us to completely understand linear equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.470
<v Speaker 2>This is one bit of maths where we kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.210
<v Speaker 2>more or less understand it, which is great and wonderful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Um, and it allows us to do two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.680
<v Speaker 2>It allows us to take big, complicated things that exist

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.560
<v Speaker 2>in weird and wonderful abstract, applied and weird places.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Often you can simplify down to a linear problem and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.910
<v Speaker 2>we can solve linear problems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 2>So that's nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 2>So that's one reason linear algebra is really important, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 2>all these bits of maths you're going to learn in

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 2>your second, third, fourth, however many years afterwards.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Often if you can make it less complicated by making

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 2>it linear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>But we can also do the opposite if we understand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in two and three dimensions, and we generalise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 2>it to 456 405, we can also generalise it out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 2>of matrices and vectors, the kind of ideas we develop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 2>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Build your mathematical brains and build the idea of how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 2>to do proof, and even how to solve these equations,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 2>so we can solve far more complicated equations later on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 2>So on that note.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Unknown>Here's Erik.

<v Unknown>Hello.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Hello.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Um, welcome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,100]}

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 3>My name is Eric Eric Horman.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I will be this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 3>This microphone is not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I will be the third lecturer on this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Despite my German sounding name, I'm actually Italian.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I studied in Italy until coming here to do my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 3>PhD, and I joined Edinburgh last Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.130
<v Speaker 3>So in a game of who joined last, I probably

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 3>win, um, hands down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So yeah, I'm teaching Introduction to Linear Algebra and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 3>bunch of other courses.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 3>The department really likes to call them by their initials,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 3>and it's just my exercise to learn all of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 3>before the first lecture of each.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 3>And, uh, of course, Andreas already gave you all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.280
<v Speaker 3>information about the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 3>So what we'll be talking about is, uh, today is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:14.450
<v Speaker 3>what linear algebra can leads you to Because, as you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.200
<v Speaker 3>mentioned, linear algebra is a fundamental part of your mathematical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 3>toolkit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.190
<v Speaker 3>And so I will give you a few examples of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.650
<v Speaker 3>where linear algebra is used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Just a few.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise we could have an entire semester course just about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.840
<v Speaker 3>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.140
<v Speaker 3>And I want to do that by going through my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.760
<v Speaker 3>experience of linear algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Linear algebra is the first course in mathematics and physics

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 3>because I did physics in my undergrad, even in Italy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 3>And the two biggest problem that I found when I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 3>did linear algebra for the first time is that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 3>was a new way of doing math, as Cordelia was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 3>explaining so well a moment ago, and also that it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 3>abstract and for the new way of doing maths, don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.170
<v Speaker 3>worry, you will get used to follow all of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 3>advice that Andrés gave you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100,100]}

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Seek out for help.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 3>We're here right on Piazza.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 3>We're just an email away if you need us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,34]}

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And the second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Well, let's see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 3>That will be my talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,88,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.000
<v Speaker 3>And the obvious reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Sorry, the obvious way of, uh, um, going past the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.130
<v Speaker 3>problem that linear algebra is very abstract is to try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.940
<v Speaker 3>and visualise it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.930
<v Speaker 3>And the standard way is what Cordelia talked about transformation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.260
<v Speaker 3>in space, either on the plane or in 3D space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh, that might work for you, but it might not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.040
<v Speaker 3>work for everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Speaker 3>And it's also very limiting in what linear algebra can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.400
<v Speaker 3>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:47.340
<v Speaker 3>So if you need, um, to think about a few

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:52.200
<v Speaker 3>more ways, uh, where what you're studying and perhaps getting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,54,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.540
<v Speaker 3>a little bit stuck on it might be useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Here are some few interesting examples to keep you motivated

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.440
<v Speaker 3>throughout these coming ten weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'll start by saying that linear algebra truly is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.270
<v Speaker 3>the language of applied mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.020
<v Speaker 3>The applications are endless and these are brought to you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.460
<v Speaker 3>in no particular order except the bias of what I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.540
<v Speaker 3>like the most.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Video games.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.440
<v Speaker 3>If you've played any major video games in the last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Speaker 3>few years, you probably have heard of ray tracing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.980
<v Speaker 3>And ray tracing is the science of generating a virtual

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.550
<v Speaker 3>image by following light rays bouncing off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:34.060
<v Speaker 3>And obviously that is a transformation in R3, the three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.110
<v Speaker 3>dimensional space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.639
<v Speaker 3>And this is why graphics engines are built on linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.240
<v Speaker 3>algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:44.500
<v Speaker 3>And, uh, this is why GPUs are really good with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.190
<v Speaker 3>linear algebra, because creating a scene on the computer is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>nothing else but solving a lot of linear algebra problems

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.629
<v Speaker 3>very quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:55.570
<v Speaker 3>And this is inherently is also why GPUs are very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,65,100,100,43,100,100,100]}

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.200
<v Speaker 3>good at machine learning, because the same mathematics that goes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.580
<v Speaker 3>behind that also goes behind training AI models.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:09.880
<v Speaker 3>And I highlighted these two methods of machine learning, principal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.730
<v Speaker 3>component analysis and singular value decomposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Because these two methods that are widely used in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.970
<v Speaker 3>lot of machine learning tasks are lifted straight from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.780
<v Speaker 3>course, they're basically a elaboration of what we would call

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.360
<v Speaker 3>eigenvalues and eigenvectors decomposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.700
<v Speaker 3>So by the end of this course, you should be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.220
<v Speaker 3>able to have a look at those methods and at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.790
<v Speaker 3>least have a basic understanding of what is going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.340
<v Speaker 3>There are some differences do not apply to square matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.430
<v Speaker 3>But we will see that, um, we will see that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.460
<v Speaker 3>um, later on this semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh, the next one is network analysis, which uh, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.920
<v Speaker 3>the topic of my PhD.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.130
<v Speaker 3>So you will forgive me if I set it aside

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.770
<v Speaker 3>for a moment and then come back and talk about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

<v Speaker 3>it a little bit more extensively in a minute.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of, uh, um, applications in physics, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.570
<v Speaker 3>example, fluid dynamics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.440
<v Speaker 3>They go under the name of finite difference methods for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.310
<v Speaker 3>differential equations, for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Speaker 3>So if you're interested in that side of computational physics,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.760
<v Speaker 3>this is also the course for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.790
<v Speaker 3>And as I mentioned, I could go on for hours

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.660
<v Speaker 3>at a time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Um, but instead let's just go back to a network.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 3>A network is a mathematical object model like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.450
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of elements connecting and interacting pairwise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It could be people connected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:38.060
<v Speaker 3>If they're friends together, they could be web pages, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:41.900
<v Speaker 3>they're connected, if and only if there's a hyperlink from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.560
<v Speaker 3>one to the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.280
<v Speaker 3>There's blue words that you click and bring you somewhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.600
<v Speaker 3>else in the World Wide Web.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,90,90,90,100]}

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.600
<v Speaker 3>It could be airports connected if and only if there's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.970
<v Speaker 3>a direct flight flying from one to the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:58.520
<v Speaker 3>And the trick is that this graph is really just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 3>a matrix that Cordelia was describing, where the matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 3>built so that there's a zero between the nodes that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.520
<v Speaker 3>don't have an edge, and the one between the nodes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 3>that do have an edge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Um, and because of that, linear algebra automatically gives a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 3>lot of results into a lot of different applications, just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.930
<v Speaker 3>by the fact that so many things, including graphs, can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.360
<v Speaker 3>be modelled by matrices and vectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.290
<v Speaker 3>So one thing that the that we're able to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,82,87,63,100,100,100]}

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 3>is to find communities, group of friends, for example, on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 3>the, on the Facebook friendship networks, probably, um, all the

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 3>people that who have gone to school with will have

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.470
<v Speaker 3>a lots of friendship in common, and so we'll be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.830

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 3>colour on this, on this friendship network.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 3>And I really want to stress this comes directly from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 3>analysing that matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 3>There is no, um, specific task performed on the graph

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.460 --> 00:37:59.730
<v Speaker 3>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Just by looking at the matrix, we can recreate that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.010
<v Speaker 3>partition into communities.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Another important one, and one that I think is really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 3>cool, is to find the most important nodes in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,61]}

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.470
<v Speaker 3>in the network, or the most important airports, or the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.400
<v Speaker 3>most important web pages on the internet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.100
<v Speaker 3>And here is the same graph just plotted with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.830
<v Speaker 3>most important nodes plotted bigger.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.790
<v Speaker 3>And again, and this result here comes straight from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,67,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.530
<v Speaker 3>application of the eigenvalue decomposition of that matrix representing the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 3>graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>So this is just purely applied linear algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just the meaning that we're giving to those elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Just just so happened to be the World Wide Web

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.940
<v Speaker 3>just so happens to be a graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why I think this is so cool

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.280
<v Speaker 3>is because this is how Google was started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Um, this is the paper that started Google.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.840
<v Speaker 3>It literally starts in this paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.680
<v Speaker 3>We present Google, and it was a linear algebra idea

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 3>that Larry Page and Sergey Brin, uh, published in 1998,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 3>and gave rise to the algorithm that sorts the web

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 3>pages for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 3>When you insert a query into the Google ask box

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 3>if you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.750
<v Speaker 3>So whenever you use Google, you're really just asking them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 3>to solve a linear algebra problem for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Um, and again I want to stress that that problem

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.430
<v Speaker 3>will be covered in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 3>It's basically an eigenvalue decomposition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 3>So we'll be in week seven I think or something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 3>like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 3>And yeah it's a big step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Um, there's a lot of material to cover.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Um, but you will see it will all ties in,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 3>it will all train together with each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,45,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as the machinery of the course gets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 3>going, you will become familiar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh, very quickly I renew the invite, not to panic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 3>of Andreas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93]}

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.820
<v Speaker 3>And you'll be fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh, just remember that whenever we see something new, try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.320
<v Speaker 3>to build on whatever you have seen before, because finding

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.960
<v Speaker 3>relationship is really the whole point of mathematics and science

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.620
<v Speaker 3>in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And so enjoy the ride.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100]}

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.580
<v Speaker 5>So we just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,72,63]}

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.470
<v Speaker 0>We could actually write okay, let's see what we're doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,72,95,100,100,65,100]}

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.830
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:32.540
<v Speaker 0>So we think half time for probably ten minutes or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.850
<v Speaker 0>so for questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.810
<v Speaker 0>Um, in case there are any that you have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:44.420
<v Speaker 0>the organisational part or to the mathematical part, anybody.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:50.660
<v Speaker 0>Um right now you can go for the throw or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.640

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.850
