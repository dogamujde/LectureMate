00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 0>Is it working?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 0>Sounds like it's working.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 0>So you get me again?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yes, we are back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 0>Here it is week five.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 0>We are halfway through.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 0>We have the attendance poll, which I think is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 0>And we have the questions from today, which I think

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 0>is that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 0>So do make sure you've done both and not just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.710

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 0>Um, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 0>So it is week five of Ila.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully you have settled into it somewhat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 0>I notice less people are coming, which sounds about right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, hopefully more of you are watching online.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 0>So there's nothing really happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 0>This it's kind of just same old, same old this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 0>week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 0>It's a bit quiet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 0>There's one announcement I'm going to make at the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 0>of the lecture, but that is kind of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,62,62,100,100,100]}

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 0>So we don't actually have all that many announcements today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 0>I'm about to take away the attendance thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 0>So if you've not done your attendance I'm going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.050

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 0>Um, cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 0>So this week we are doing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 0>are very important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 0>Actually they are one of those Method things that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 0>do everywhere in maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95]}

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 0>So we're back to doing computational stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 0>It's not overly theoretical this week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 0>It's a lot of computations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 0>Um, so to get us started, a little bit of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 0>a revision.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,90]}

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, which of these are linear transformations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 0>So some revision from week three I think week two,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 0>transformations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 0>Have a chat, have a vote, and then we'll discuss

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 0>these all a bit more.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Unknown>Hmm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have another 20s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.000
<v Speaker 0>What are we thinking?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 0>10s.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.110
<v Speaker 0>Maybe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.079
<v Speaker 0>Five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 0>Four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 0>Three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.680
<v Speaker 0>Two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.390
<v Speaker 0>One.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.950
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look at what we've got.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, actually, I clicked the wrong thing off there, didn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 0>I?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 0>We seem overwhelmingly happy that a reflection and a rotation

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 0>around the origin are both linear transformations.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.380
<v Speaker 0>What are the comments matrix?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Speaker 0>Good, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 0>And only if it's about the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 0>It's only for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80]}

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 0>Why is it only for about the origin?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 0>What's very important about the origin and a linear transformation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.560

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 0>The origin is a fixed point.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 0>It's got to be mapped to itself.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we're happy with those two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 0>We seem we seem also relatively happy that a translation

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.850

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.820
<v Speaker 0>Why is the translation not a linear transformation?

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.780

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,98]}

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 0>Conditions which yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100]}

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.580
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.570
<v Speaker 0>Which one does it break?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100]}

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.410
<v Unknown>Was white because it was too white.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.610
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.390
<v Speaker 0>You you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75]}

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.710
<v Speaker 0>It actually breaks both of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 0>Translations are very bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,75,100,100]}

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.280
<v Speaker 0>They don't fix the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.000
<v Speaker 0>They don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.310
<v Speaker 0>They're not linear with respect to addition.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Speaker 0>So yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 0>Not a translation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100]}

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.880
<v Speaker 0>Good okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.040
<v Speaker 0>Then we seem to have the two kind of.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.580
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.870
<v Speaker 0>So you could, you could, you can fix the, the,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.510
<v Speaker 0>1004, where you're scaling the x component of any vector

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.140

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.570

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.140
<v Speaker 0>is not.

<v Speaker 0>Does anyone want to kind of either argue to for

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.480
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not linear because it's not linear in multiplication.

<v Speaker 0>Oh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100]}

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 0>That's a very good argument.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Not the way you were meaning it to be, but.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 0>Um.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 0>So it can be represented by the matrix of zeros.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.810
<v Speaker 0>Actually, turns out that one also is a linear transformation.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 0>You just have a big matrix full of zeros.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:17.200
<v Speaker 0>So four out of my five were linear transformations.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.870
<v Speaker 0>Uh, hooray!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61]}

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.400
<v Speaker 0>We got that right.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 0>Yay!

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.250
<v Speaker 0>We were right.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.540
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.870
<v Speaker 0>So let's just think about these geometrically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.300

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.289

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.940
<v Speaker 0>Um, and hopefully this will work and you'll be able

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.719

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.909
<v Speaker 0>So let us consider the first one.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:46.660

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.240

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay, that's a bit boring.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.180
<v Speaker 0>What about this point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.680
<v Speaker 0>Where is that going to get mapped to?

<v Speaker 0>Down, down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100]}

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.810

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.070

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.550
<v Speaker 0>So those two just kind of swap um that point

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.210
<v Speaker 0>stays the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.040
<v Speaker 0>Are there any other points that may be a kind

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.100

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 0>So it's the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,95,100,100]}

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.540
<v Speaker 0>Has to stay the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.830
<v Speaker 0>It's a linear transformation.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.550
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.450
<v Speaker 0>Important one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.710
<v Speaker 0>But yeah okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.130
<v Speaker 0>So we have um what happens to the x axis

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.450

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.110

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.240
<v Speaker 0>So we have a fixed line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.230
<v Speaker 0>It's completely fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone see another line that might be fixed?

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.210
<v Speaker 0>Yet as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[29,85,97]}

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.320
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.550
<v Speaker 0>Because it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,92]}

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Kind of just being.

<v Speaker 0>Identically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.030
<v Speaker 0>So actually if we if we consider that line there,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 0>we know that point is getting mapped to that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,62,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.710
<v Speaker 0>So actually this whole vector is just getting mapped to

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 0>that whole vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.770
<v Speaker 0>But that preserves the whole line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.800
<v Speaker 0>So we have another fixed line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.650
<v Speaker 0>The line's fixed but the points aren't fixed on the

<v Speaker 0>line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.920
<v Speaker 0>So on the red line every point is fixed and

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.120

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.220
<v Speaker 0>So if we call this one v, what's v getting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.070
<v Speaker 0>mapped to minus v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.750
<v Speaker 0>So in blue we have whatever our matrix is is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.900
<v Speaker 0>getting mapped to minus three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.890
<v Speaker 0>Whereas here, if I call that one x because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.160
<v Speaker 0>the x axis that's getting mapped to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.070
<v Speaker 0>Everybody happy so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.200
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 0>What about if we stretch the y component by a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.300
<v Speaker 0>factor of four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 0>What happens there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's let's do the same game.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.010
<v Speaker 0>What happens to my origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 0>Fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 0>What happens to a point on the x axis stays

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 0>Why does it stay the same?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.920
<v Speaker 0>Yeah okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 0>So again this picture is looking remarkably similar to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 0>first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.200
<v Speaker 0>Let's consider this point here then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 0>Where does that get mapped to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.150
<v Speaker 0>Up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 0>Yeah I've, I realised I've fairly steeply made a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,58,100,43,85,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 0>of a mistake.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.120
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to actually take it to be that point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 0>and we're mapping that one up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.600
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise I'm off the sheet of paper.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.590
<v Speaker 0>So we're now mapping that one up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.710
<v Speaker 0>So let's think about fixed lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.100
<v Speaker 0>Again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 0>This looks fairly similar to this picture but a bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.430
<v Speaker 0>different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.510
<v Speaker 0>Can anyone give me a fixed line whereas another fixed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 0>line the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.700
<v Speaker 0>Yet we've seen nothing happens on the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[36,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.570
<v Speaker 0>That's a fixed line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.080
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, and actually it's just like we had before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:10.370
<v Speaker 0>It's fixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.940
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.690
<v Speaker 0>Point wise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93]}

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.100
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.320
<v Speaker 0>Anybody else think of another fixed line?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.510
<v Speaker 0>Parallel to the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.520
<v Speaker 0>Any line is parallel to the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:22.790
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.390
<v Speaker 0>Why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Get maximum four times their y value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,62,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So they would stay on the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.070
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.740
<v Speaker 0>So anything here is going to again going to have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.910
<v Speaker 0>this fixed line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.690
<v Speaker 0>And what's the kind of matrix equation that I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.990
<v Speaker 0>write in this case as opposed to this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.540
<v Speaker 0>Feel free to yell it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It'd.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Be good for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100]}

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.020
<v Speaker 0>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.590
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.460
<v Speaker 0>Perfect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.260
<v Speaker 0>So we're just stretching.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Speaker 0>Well, technically, actually, that's if that's a V, but but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100]}

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:54.660
<v Speaker 0>but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.610
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.220
<v Speaker 0>Are we generally happy so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 0>So actually looking at the fixed points tells us quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.860
<v Speaker 0>a lot about the geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.380
<v Speaker 0>We don't actually have to know what the, um, transformation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69]}

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.600
<v Speaker 0>is if we can just kind of look at the

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.220
<v Speaker 0>fixed points, and that's helping us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.750
<v Speaker 0>What about a rotation by pi by two around the

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.230
<v Speaker 0>origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.010
<v Speaker 0>Whereas let's do the origin again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.000
<v Speaker 0>Where's that going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.590
<v Speaker 0>It's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.790
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 0>Where's my point to my x axis going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.060
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.950
<v Speaker 0>It's going round to the y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.010
<v Speaker 0>And where's my general point x going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.330
<v Speaker 0>I've got various hand movements, which is quite fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.260
<v Speaker 0>I think we're all kind of suggesting something like that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 0>but, but, but round as opposed to a flipping, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.650
<v Speaker 0>good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what's fixed?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100]}

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.190
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything fixed here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.960
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a fixed line?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.430
<v Speaker 0>Do we have a fixed point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.590
<v Speaker 0>The origin?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.070
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.210
<v Speaker 0>Anything else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.930
<v Speaker 0>So there's no fixed line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.790
<v Speaker 0>So that's quite interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.410
<v Speaker 0>We've now got nothing fixed.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, but but there's still some kind of structure being

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.670
<v Speaker 0>preserved.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.860
<v Speaker 0>We're going to come back to that a bit later.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.110

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.860
<v Speaker 0>Where does the origin go?

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.330
<v Speaker 1>To the.

<v Speaker 0>Where does that go?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 0>The origin?

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 0>So actually and they feel something slightly different about these

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.470

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.850

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.360

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79]}

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.450
<v Speaker 0>It's very important because if it's trivial, why is it

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:43.810

<v Speaker 0>We know.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.980
<v Speaker 0>That's not telling us anything we didn't already know.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, what we want is vectors, the kind of preserve

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.600
<v Speaker 0>lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.880
<v Speaker 0>And if I've got a vector and I'm observing the

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.260

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.140
<v Speaker 0>But I'm not changing the vector so I can multiply

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:14.410

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:23.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that's telling us something about fixing fixing a

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.870

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 0>Anyway, um, he they were inspired by the Hilbert problems,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.240

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.320

<v Speaker 0>Lisa.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, and actually, I can keep going.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.520
<v Speaker 0>I could change my matrix And we keep distorting this

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.240
<v Speaker 0>picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.800
<v Speaker 0>Does anything anybody notice anything that's not changing with this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.760
<v Speaker 0>picture, though?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.680
<v Speaker 0>The origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.250
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 0>I wasn't expecting that answer, but yes, the origin is

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.730
<v Speaker 0>not changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what else isn't changing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.130
<v Speaker 0>What else is kind of staying the same?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.490
<v Speaker 0>The lines?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, the edges of the picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.210
<v Speaker 0>We're keeping the edges of the picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.550
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's being very distorted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.030
<v Speaker 1>But.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.750
<v Speaker 0>Her nose is still between her eyes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, somewhat.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.590
<v Speaker 0>Um, so this is what a linear transformation is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.330
<v Speaker 0>It's distorting stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.140
<v Speaker 0>But the fundamental thing we have still retains its kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100]}

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.670
<v Speaker 0>of basic properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 0>So a picture is still going to kind of look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 0>like the picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 0>That was a good bit of timing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, for the most of the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Pardon Was.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 0>That a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 0>Nope.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 0>And that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.820
<v Speaker 0>So actually we can find out quite a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,87,81]}

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 0>Now I have to pause this at exactly the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.850
<v Speaker 0>time, and I just missed it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 0>Uh, something does happen a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I missed it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100]}

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 0>We'll have to wait for the next one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, let's see if I can do it this time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 0>Oh, nearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85]}

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 0>What happens at that point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 0>She disappears.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 0>How have we got rid of the Mona Lisa?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 0>I have stolen the Mona Lisa.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 0>This is not good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 0>What's happened there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100]}

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 0>The determinant of our matrix is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.690
<v Speaker 0>Quite clearly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully, we all notice our matrix is determined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 0>And if we think about our two lines, what's happened

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 0>to our two lines?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 0>They became one line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89]}

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Speaker 0>So our two lines started overlapping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's a kind of degenerative Case that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 0>should have in the back of our mind.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.640

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.390

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:52.830
<v Speaker 0>So let us think of some of some questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, if I have given you the identity matrix what

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.730

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.400

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.250
<v Speaker 0>Thingy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.380

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.060

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.430
<v Speaker 0>So let's let's come back to the definition and think

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.510

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.310
<v Speaker 0>So actually let's look at the actual definition in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 0>book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.170
<v Speaker 0>Where's that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100]}

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.240
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.610
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, we have an n by n matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.510
<v Speaker 0>We have a scalar number lambda, which is the eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 0>If this equation holds for some column that doesn't equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 0>zero in n we'll call x a vector rather than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 0>a column.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 0>Um but yeah we want x to be nontrivial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 0>We want it to be not the origin because we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 0>always know what the origin does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 0>It's boring.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100]}

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 0>The origin goes to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 0>That's what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 0>We know that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 0>So we're not actually very interested in the origin because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 0>we know what happens to it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 0>So actually in the eigenvalue equation we very much want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,82]}

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 0>it not to be the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 0>So if we have the identity yes, the identity sends

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 0>the origin to the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 0>But the origin is never an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 0>So everything is an eigenvector except the origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.300
<v Speaker 0>Because we don't care.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100]}

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.250
<v Speaker 0>The origin is never an eigenvector.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.480
<v Speaker 0>It's a technical point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.600
<v Speaker 0>It's one of those technical definitions where you've got to

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.910

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.290

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:45.970
<v Speaker 0>an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's try a second question then.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.010
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll sit and discuss it a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.550
<v Speaker 0>We'll be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,72]}

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:30.320
<v Speaker 0>So so far we've got that lots of people saying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,49,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.200
<v Speaker 0>minus two thirds whereas was why have I got minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.450
<v Speaker 0>two thirds up there whereas minus two thirds come from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.350
<v Speaker 0>Gradient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.680
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.500
<v Speaker 0>So actually this is the line and we know the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 0>gradient of this line is minus two thirds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.180
<v Speaker 0>So it kind of that that is a number that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.140
<v Speaker 0>floating around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68]}

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.200
<v Speaker 0>We've got some people saying one, some people say minus

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.630
<v Speaker 0>1Y1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:57.320
<v Speaker 0>Anyone got an idea what to say Y one is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,73,100]}

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:00.590
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.330
<v Speaker 0>So so the eigenvalues for them would be good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,81,85,83,86,81,45,88,100]}

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.750
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.510
<v Speaker 0>If we have if we have a vector there then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.040
<v Speaker 0>that's getting mapped to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,83,100,100]}

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.160
<v Speaker 0>So so that v there is an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.320
<v Speaker 0>Um what about minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.900
<v Speaker 0>That seems the second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.910
<v Speaker 0>Another popular one more popular than one, actually.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Speaker 0>Wears a vector with minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.590
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:37.950
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.840
<v Speaker 0>So here's another vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.960
<v Speaker 0>And that one's going to get reflected to there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.720
<v Speaker 0>So there's v and there's minus v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.110
<v Speaker 0>I've called everything v red v and blue v.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,67,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.340
<v Speaker 0>So one and minus one seem happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.390
<v Speaker 0>Uh what about two okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,45,88]}

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:54.870
<v Speaker 0>Two thirds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.610
<v Speaker 0>Where's the eigenvector for two thirds?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Speaker 0>Minus two thirds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.910
<v Speaker 0>Anybody got any ideas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.320
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.820
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so what kind of vector here is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,65]}

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.120
<v Speaker 0>So kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:24.900
<v Speaker 0>Over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,86]}

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.240
<v Speaker 0>There.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.730
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.590
<v Speaker 0>One way to think about this is we know that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.460
<v Speaker 0>if you're reflecting, then let's just consider vectors through the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.300
<v Speaker 0>origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, that distance from the origin is going to get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.210
<v Speaker 0>reflected to something that has the same distance from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:54.660
<v Speaker 0>origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.140
<v Speaker 0>So actually what minus two thirds is going to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.350
<v Speaker 0>that as an eigenvalue that's going to scale your vector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.970
<v Speaker 0>And none of your vectors are actually changing their size

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.050
<v Speaker 0>in a reflection.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.310
<v Speaker 0>They're changing their position but they're not changing the size

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.720
<v Speaker 0>you are away from, from the line, your perpendicular distance

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.419
<v Speaker 0>to the line that is a perpendicular projection, which you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,63,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:22.120
<v Speaker 0>should have seen week before last with Andreas.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75]}

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:27.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, so actually we only have two eigenvalues here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.669
<v Speaker 0>We have eigenvalue one and we have eigenvalue minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:34.690
<v Speaker 0>And that is true for any reflection in the world.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.600
<v Speaker 0>If you have a matrix and you find out the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.139
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalues are only 1 or -1, then that is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,86,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:45.190
<v Speaker 0>reflection of some sort, um, a straight up reflection, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.540
<v Speaker 0>is quite a helpful thing to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.280
<v Speaker 0>So now we're getting to the point where actually we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.419
<v Speaker 0>can identify geometrically what a matrix is doing just by

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:55.720
<v Speaker 0>looking at the eigenvalues, which is really helpful in high

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.840
<v Speaker 0>dimensions, because, I mean, I can just about draw something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.710
<v Speaker 0>in two dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.240
<v Speaker 0>Three dimensions is iffy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,73]}

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.340
<v Speaker 0>Four dimensions is just wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.740
<v Speaker 0>Oh, I can't do four dimensions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.350
<v Speaker 0>So but I can use this maths.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.630
<v Speaker 0>I can use this maths to identify when we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:16.300
<v Speaker 0>a reflection in higher dimensions, which is always useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's actually think about how we can calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.620
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.750
<v Speaker 0>And we have a theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.660
<v Speaker 0>So A is a eigenvalue of our matrix A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.520
<v Speaker 0>Uh if you can't see it that is a good

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.330
<v Speaker 0>point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.910
<v Speaker 0>Actually I think I probably wanted to do that, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,95,100,100]}

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.810
<v Speaker 0>I will we'll do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,68,100,100]}

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.530
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:42.850
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.770
<v Speaker 0>So so have we actually come across the term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.630
<v Speaker 0>The following are equivalent before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100]}

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.100
<v Speaker 0>This is a proper like maths term that sometimes get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.740
<v Speaker 0>shortened to TFA.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.240
<v Speaker 0>You get TFA.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.820
<v Speaker 0>The following are equivalent to theorems where they just write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.580
<v Speaker 0>tf a, and then they write a load of statements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.810
<v Speaker 0>And you have to kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.310
<v Speaker 0>I remember the first time I saw that, I was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:03.700
<v Speaker 0>like, what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76]}

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.930
<v Speaker 0>What is TFA?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,88,100]}

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.960
<v Speaker 0>It's the following or equivalent when you see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.110
<v Speaker 0>Um, so you get a list of statements and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.000
<v Speaker 0>earn, you have to show them all the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.430
<v Speaker 0>So you have an eigenvalue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:20.060
<v Speaker 0>If lambda of I n minus a is not invertible,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:24.830
<v Speaker 0>which is equivalent to the determinant being zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that is a theorem that's really important because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.510
<v Speaker 0>this last bit this determinant is a is called the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.740
<v Speaker 0>characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.590
<v Speaker 0>And as of last week we all learnt how to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.780
<v Speaker 0>calculate determinants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:47.120
<v Speaker 0>So that is something we can calculate with relative ease

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.930
<v Speaker 0>hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.240
<v Speaker 0>Um particularly in nice cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,84,100]}

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.050
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what we are going to do now for bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:58.370
<v Speaker 0>though is um, pause slightly before we actually find an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalue and discuss proof, because I'm not sure anyone's actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.370
<v Speaker 0>discussed proof with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.060
<v Speaker 0>So what is a maths proof?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.350
<v Speaker 0>Um, the point of maths quite quickly, hopefully you kind

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.720
<v Speaker 0>of realise this is we quite quickly build up to

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.700
<v Speaker 0>stuff that we can't draw pictures of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.160
<v Speaker 0>That's a bit abstract and that's a bit theoretical and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 0>out there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, have people experienced this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.750
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.090
<v Speaker 0>You go from the calculations and the numbers they're all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,50,100]}

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.430
<v Speaker 0>happy with, and then quite suddenly it's like, here's a

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's not the same in physics potentially, or chemistry

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.530
<v Speaker 0>or bits where you can do an actual experiment.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.050
<v Speaker 0>You can't do an experiment in maths and write down

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 0>what the results are, because you're dealing with stuff that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.220
<v Speaker 0>doesn't exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, physically it exists in our heads.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.170
<v Speaker 0>So we kind of have to have and we build

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 0>It's like I always think of maths as a tower.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.990

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.740

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.260

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.160
<v Speaker 0>Um, but we do that from a very, very small

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 0>we're building very tall skyscrapers that have a tiny, tiny

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.790
<v Speaker 0>Um, which is actually quite scary when you think about

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:41.270

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.540

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.000
<v Speaker 1>So a bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,69,100]}

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.690

<v Speaker 1>The.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.240
<v Speaker 0>Way we do that and we can do that is

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.240

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.630
<v Speaker 0>And to do that we have to use proof.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.720
<v Speaker 0>We have to use proof that is so irrefutable.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.490
<v Speaker 0>No one is going to come and knock our tower

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.360
<v Speaker 0>I do not think that bricks laid correctly because you're

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.350

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.920
<v Speaker 0>That brick has definitely laid correctly.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.920

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.560
<v Speaker 0>That is why we are we bang on about proof

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.380

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.050

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.210
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's actually try and prove this statement and

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.040

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, so we're going to start with um, lambda is

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.130
<v Speaker 0>an eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.830
<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have any suggestions for what the first line

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 0>of this proof should be?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.260
<v Speaker 0>That's not in the thing.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.970
<v Speaker 0>Oh, what is the thing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,65,100,100]}

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.770
<v Speaker 0>That was the thing I've zoomed in, that's why.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:56.910
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.600
<v Speaker 0>Anyone got any ideas?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.800
<v Speaker 0>What the first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.870
<v Speaker 0>Where should I start writing this proof?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.690
<v Speaker 0>It's a definition I gave.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.970
<v Speaker 0>I'm actually going to do something before I even use

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.600

<v Speaker 0>Does anyone have any?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.220
<v Speaker 0>I need to be really concrete about where I am.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.840
<v Speaker 0>So what's the first thing I need to do before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.830
<v Speaker 0>actually, I yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,95]}

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.450
<v Speaker 0>Land is not equal to zero, but if I start

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.700
<v Speaker 0>writing land in or equal to zero, the first question

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.020
<v Speaker 0>someone comes along who's trying to, you know, throw away

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.850
<v Speaker 0>all of this is what's lambda?

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.330
<v Speaker 0>So actually we're starting even earlier.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.250
<v Speaker 0>We are starting with the question.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.810
<v Speaker 0>Let us define things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92,100,100]}

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:40.800
<v Speaker 0>And this is really important.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.110
<v Speaker 0>We need somebody has to come along and know what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.470
<v Speaker 0>So we're actually going to start with a we're going

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.410

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.200
<v Speaker 0>That's step one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.000
<v Speaker 0>Let's define what we're actually doing.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.820
<v Speaker 0>And then we can and then we can use the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:02.310

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.690

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.820
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't always have to be the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:17.680

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.150
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:27.460
<v Speaker 0>So if there exists some x again we're defining.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100]}

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.100

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.350

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.510
<v Speaker 0>That equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:14.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:15.370
<v Speaker 0>That's not a vector.

<v Speaker 0>That's just zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.870
<v Speaker 0>I take a vector away from this vector, I get

<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.810
<v Speaker 0>What next?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 1>You can write lambda x as lambda.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, so why why do I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,65,83,83,83]}

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.050
<v Speaker 0>What's the next step?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.670
<v Speaker 0>Why is that important?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:46.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87]}

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.590
<v Speaker 0>Factorise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[19]}

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.550
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to factorise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.700
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.210
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:53.590
<v Speaker 0>So why is it important that I wrote, um, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:56.470
<v Speaker 0>identity before I factorised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.590
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.670
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise, I'd be saying a matrix minus a number times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.010
<v Speaker 0>x, which doesn't make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.290
<v Speaker 0>So I need a matrix minus a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 0>Um, so I need that that identity matrix there to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.600
<v Speaker 0>make my lambda a matrix and not just a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 0>I can't take away a number from a matrix.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 0>So that's another important thing we need to kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.740
<v Speaker 0>bear in mind what are the elements we're talking about.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 0>So I've got to that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 0>Um, why I'm now going to say I can therefore

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 0>write.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 0>Therefore a minus lambda x is not invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Why if it's invertible, then it's, uh it's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.690
<v Speaker 0>So we can say as x is a non-trivial solution

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.710

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:54.050 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, then by uh, I looked this up, theorem 2.4.5,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.860
<v Speaker 0>We know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 0>I could write that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.180
<v Speaker 0>Okay, good.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 0>Everyone happy so far?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.030
<v Speaker 0>Um, what about next?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.120
<v Speaker 0>What are, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100]}

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.170
<v Speaker 0>What's the last line?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 0>The determinant equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.330
<v Speaker 0>They're the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.200
<v Speaker 0>So I could say, um, it's actually it's actually a

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:48.680
<v Speaker 0>theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.580
<v Speaker 0>So it's another term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71]}

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:56.720
<v Speaker 0>So I could say by theorem 3.2.2 uh non invertible

<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 0>And then we're done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 0>So I draw a little square box or I like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,70,100,57]}

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 0>QED or something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100]}

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 0>Um, to say it's the end of my proof, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.210
<v Speaker 0>that's all you need to prove that statement.

<v Speaker 0>that statement.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 0>You don't need loads and loads of stuff, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 0>I can subtract two things.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 0>Um, but you do need to bear in mind, particularly

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 0>We kind of expected you to write proofs without telling

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 0>interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay, we have five more minutes, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.390
<v Speaker 0>Let us have a quick go using this this thing.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 0>So we want to find the determinant of a matrix,

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 0>uh, to find the eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 0>So what are the easiest matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 0>We can find the determinants for two by two.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.890
<v Speaker 0>What about general n by n diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.700
<v Speaker 0>Let's actually go up a triangular because I can someone

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 0>yell numbers at me.

<v Speaker 0>1335992.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.720
<v Speaker 0>Any one more.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 0>42.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.930
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 0>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so there is a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 0>Let us find the eigenvalues of that matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 0>So we want to consider the matrix a lambda I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,40,100,100]}

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 0>n minus a one point I will actually make which

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.140

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 0>Lots of people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 0>So the textbook and lots of people talk about lambda

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 0>I n minus a other people talk about a minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 0>lambda in these are equivalent when we're finding eigenvalues because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,60,100,100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 0>we're making it the determinant equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 0>Um this one's nicer for the polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 0>This one's nicer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.070
<v Speaker 0>From a calculation point of view they are entirely equivalent.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 0>Some textbooks go one way, some go the other.

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we have lambda I n minus a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,94]}

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.140

<v Speaker 0>So, so tomorrow we are going to talk about finding

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 0>eigenvectors and diagonalising.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 0>And we probably will have a bit of time at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 0>the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 0>Is there anything that you particularly want to spend more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 0>time on, anything from today or anything from this week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 0>reading that you want to spend a bit more time

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.470
<v Speaker 0>on eigenvectors?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.540
<v Speaker 0>We will discuss eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.190
<v Speaker 0>Um, and then we will think about next week's, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.000
<v Speaker 0>tomorrow's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.330
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:11.660
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.570
<v Speaker 0>It is 3:00, 1:00, not 3:00, 1:00.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.060
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is now a one way system in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,46,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:17.360
<v Speaker 0>lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 0>Apparently, they've unblocked this door, so I'm supposed to encourage

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.900
<v Speaker 0>you to leave via this door here as opposed to

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.170
<v Speaker 0>the door?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.120
<v Speaker 0>The back, so people can come in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 0>I will see you next week, you know, tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 0>I'll see you tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, yeah.
