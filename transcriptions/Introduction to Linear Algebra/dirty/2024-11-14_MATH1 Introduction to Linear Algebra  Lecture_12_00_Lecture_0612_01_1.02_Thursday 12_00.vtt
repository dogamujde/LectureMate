WEBVTT

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 0>Welcome to the first lecture of week nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 0>Before we start, this is the Attendance Book club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,75]}

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 0>So I will be putting on the one for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 0>problems of today shortly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 0>But before we start that, there is a short announcement,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 0>which is that the School of Mathematics is running some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 0>exam preparation and effective revision, or the other way around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 0>I don't remember workshops which are running from the 20th

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 0>of November.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 0>So approximately a week from now up until the 29th,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 0>you can register there is a link which, uh, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,62,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 0>Andreas is going to share on the learn page.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 0>So my job here at the moment is just telling

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 0>you that, um, just keep an eye out on learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,82]}

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 0>for the announcement if you're interested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 0>It can be useful if you're struggling with the organisational

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 0>aspect of, uh, preparing for your exams.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 0>Having said that, let's, uh, have a quick look at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 0>the outline for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 0>Um, in the meantime, I'm going to switch the book

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 0>club behind the scenes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 0>There we go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 0>So now the book club is no longer the attendance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 0>This one should be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 0>If it comes out, yes, this one should be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 0>one for the problems of today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 0>So if you could scan it in the meantime, that'd

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 0>be great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, in the meantime, this week, as you've seen from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 0>the from the reading, we have two slightly different things

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 0>to juggle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 0>The first one is the concept of similarity for matrices,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 0>which is an interesting concept in itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, we will talk a little bit more about why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 0>similarity is interested as an equivalence relation, and how uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 0>theoretical algebra, um, thing in terms of, uh, equivalence relations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,99,65,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 0>But it's also interesting because similar matrices share quite a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 0>long list of property among themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.180
<v Speaker 0>And we can then exploit similarity to say something interesting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 0>about about those matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 0>And instead tomorrow we will tackle the other main topic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 0>of the reading of this of this week, which has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 0>more to do about, uh, sort of, uh, extension of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 0>the similarity procedures that we have seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 0>We're now familiar with how to calculate eigenvectors and eigenspaces,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 0>uh, for matrices of, uh, any, any size, any square

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 0>size through the characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 0>And we will generalise the concept of eigenvectors to eigenspaces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 0>and we will give some equivalence relation between, um, between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,61,100,100,99,100]}

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 0>those two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 0>Uh, definitions that we've seen one in this week and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 0>one a couple weeks ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 0>And in particular the concept of multiplicity will come out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 0>and we will relate it with what you already already

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 0>know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 0>So this is the, uh, sort of a bird's eye

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 0>view of the content of the week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 0>This is the same book club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,86]}

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 0>The code is still the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 0>And today, instead of jumping right into an exercise, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 0>thought that, uh, given that the central concept will be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 0>similarity, let's give it a definition first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 0>I'm sure you remember it, but, uh, two matrices are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 0>similar, and we write a tilde B if it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,77]}

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 0>an invertible matrix P such that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 0>The second matrix in the in the similarity b can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 0>be written as p minus one, a p, and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 0>I hope it was clear from the reading and from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 0>the video that I've made in the in the reading

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 0>section.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 0>Um, this this definition has a little bit of flexibility

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 0>built in it because the similarity is, um, symmetric.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 0>So if A similar to b, b is similar to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,96,100,100]}

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 0>a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 0>And so we could actually rewrite that that expression as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 0>a equal p minus 1ABP that is an equivalent version

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 0>of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 0>And because p is invertible p minus one is invertible

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 0>as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 0>And so we can also rewrite that as b equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 0>p a p minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 0>They're all equivalent version.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 0>But the original one that we've seen from the from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 0>the book Was was this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, just a quick example of how we calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.950
<v Speaker 0>the similar matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,89,99]}

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 0>Well, I put this example just to show you that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 0>uh, um, similar matrices do not share structure between themselves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.900
<v Speaker 0>So by choosing this, uh, uh, this matrix A and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 0>this and this invertible matrix P, we can move A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 0>to another matrix B, which is this one here, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 0>B is lower triangular and A was not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 0>So um, similarity preserves a lot of characteristic of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100]}

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.400
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but uh, not the structure in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 0>So it is uh, um, it is interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 0>It's not that if we move from one matrix to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 0>a similar one, we are not really doing anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 0>And if you've watched the video, I make the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 0>that similarity moves between different matrix representation of the same

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 0>linear transformation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 0>And what I mean by that is that, uh, linear

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 0>transformations are the fundamental concept of linear algebra, and matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100]}

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 0>express linear transformations in terms of a specific base.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 0>And so what we're doing when we pass from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 0>matrix to the other with the similarity, we are rephrasing

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 0>the same linear transformation acting on our n into um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,95]}

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 0>from one, from the expression in one base to the

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.120

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 0>us to move from the basis of the first, uh,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 0>sorry, from the vectors of the first space to the

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 0>vector of the second base we've seen is p minus

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 0>And we know that because p minus one is the

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 0>matrix that moves the eigenvectors of the matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 0>We'll see more about that a little bit later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 0>But this was the two minute summary of what we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 0>trying to do and why we're trying, uh and why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100]}

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 0>matrix similarity is interesting at its core.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 0>Um, having done the introduction, we have five exercises today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 0>One is, uh, just like last, last week with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 0>tiered exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 0>I will ask you to, um, pick and choose the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 0>level that you feel comfortable dealing with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh, one is a new addition, which is a brainstorming

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 0>exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 0>We will reuse a reconstruction of the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 0>But the first one that we start with is something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 0>that, uh, we've always used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 0>It's a good old, uh, number of statements that, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 0>you need to, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.760
<v Speaker 0>You need to analyse and tell me if they're true

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 0>or not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 0>And they're all based on the similarity definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.840
<v Speaker 0>And so let's try to build an understanding on how,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:12.840
<v Speaker 0>um, matrix similarity and more generally, um, equivalence relation work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.720
<v Speaker 0>So there's five of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.340
<v Speaker 0>They should be fairly, fairly straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.830
<v Speaker 0>Um, I'll just come around very quickly to check that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.390
<v Speaker 0>everything is working out for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.980
<v Speaker 0>And then we can we can go through them together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I can see the book club is working and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 0>everything is working fine from the IT side of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 0>As usual, try and discuss share ideas, especially if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 0>disagree with your neighbours.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88]}

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 0>That's, uh, that's the best case scenario, because then, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 0>at least 50% of you will learn something new.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I see I have almost 60 answers already, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,75,79,100]}

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.310
<v Speaker 0>I would invite those of you who are still submitting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Speaker 0>them, uh, to put in your answer, lock them in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.510
<v Speaker 0>and let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.740
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100]}

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.130
<v Speaker 0>Great response rate for the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I made it too simple, Probably.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,50,100,100]}

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:53.050
<v Speaker 0>And then you think, broadly speaking, that three and 5th

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 0>May be, uh, may be correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,89,100,62,62,100]}

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 0>And two and four are definitely not, not, not the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.990
<v Speaker 0>right one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 0>And I didn't specify this, but I hope it was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.400
<v Speaker 0>clear by notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 0>When I have the similarity crossed out, just as equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.580
<v Speaker 0>becomes not equal to the tilde crossed would mean uh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,94,100,100,82]}

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.000
<v Speaker 0>b in the second case a not similar to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 0>The first statement you've identified, 97% got this right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,95,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 0>It's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.620
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we have shown that the proof for transitivity, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.900
<v Speaker 0>we know that transitivity is, uh, property of, um, equivalence

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,48,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 0>relations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.800
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I've just copy pasted the proof from my video

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.340
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.290
<v Speaker 0>Um, there is just one, uh, little bit that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.210
<v Speaker 0>need to, that we need to add in that transitivity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 0>is done for normally two pairs of matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 0>So the transitivity is normally expressed as a similar to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 0>b be similar to see A similar to c.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 0>Here we're skipping one step more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 0>We're doing a similar to b b similar to c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,79,100,100,97]}

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 0>c similar to d a similar to d, but you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 0>can just repeat the same proof twice to extend to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 0>as many to as many matrices you to like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,81,21,99]}

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so nothing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 0>Nothing particularly nothing particularly deep here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 0>It's just the same proof all over again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 0>And you get to the to the result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 0>A little bit more interesting was probably this one.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.250
<v Speaker 0>Um, can someone from the majority, from the people that

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.990
<v Speaker 0>answered that this is false?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.020
<v Speaker 0>Give me a quick reason why they think so.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Well, this is false because it is true that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,35,100]}

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.770
<v Speaker 1>contrapositive would be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100]}

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And we are we would be saying if A is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.800
<v Speaker 1>similar to C, then it k is similar to any

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 1>matrix B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64]}

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.840
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.650
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.540
<v Speaker 0>So you're right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.950
<v Speaker 0>That is one way of seeing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.700
<v Speaker 0>If we know that this is equivalent to the contrapositive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.750
<v Speaker 0>statement, which would be if A is similar to C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.940
<v Speaker 0>because that's the negation of what's on the right hand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.520
<v Speaker 0>side, then the negation of what's on the left hand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.780
<v Speaker 0>side is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.030
<v Speaker 0>And so we would be saying if A similar to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 0>C, then A must also be similar to B, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.410
<v Speaker 0>is a random matrix that doesn't appear in the hypothesis.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.250
<v Speaker 0>And so that that's a that's a nice giveaway that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.800
<v Speaker 0>this must in fact be be false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,96,100]}

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.030
<v Speaker 0>And it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.220
<v Speaker 0>I was going along slightly different lines here, and the

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.710
<v Speaker 0>point that I was trying to make is that, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.300
<v Speaker 0>if transitivity works for a property, it doesn't necessarily mean

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.160
<v Speaker 0>that it works for the opposite property.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:11.270
<v Speaker 0>So we have proven that, uh, that, um, um, that

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.230

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.220
<v Speaker 0>That doesn't imply that not being similar, uh, also has

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.150
<v Speaker 0>that property.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.740
<v Speaker 0>And that is true in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.550
<v Speaker 0>It goes way beyond, um, matrix similarity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,67]}

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.190
<v Speaker 0>It's true for any possible, um, an equivalence relation that

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.350
<v Speaker 0>you will find in mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 0>And uh, you can also construct a very simple counterexample

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.910

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.300

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.210

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.690

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 0>And so for that specific choices of p because this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 0>one is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 0>This one also needs needs to be true.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Speaker 0>And thus uh, um, and thus satisfy the condition of

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.560
<v Speaker 0>similarity between these two matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.970
<v Speaker 0>And note that, uh, there can be any shenanigan going

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.420
<v Speaker 0>on with the dimensions because A is invertible, so it's

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.230
<v Speaker 0>square.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:53.470 --> 00:19:00.160
<v Speaker 0>And uh, therefore, um, that, uh, thing makes sense from

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.900

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.890
<v Speaker 0>This one is interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.900
<v Speaker 0>At least I found it interesting.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.930
<v Speaker 0>Uh, if A similar to B and C is similar

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.100

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.800

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.130
<v Speaker 0>curious to hear from someone who says no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,77]}

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.200
<v Speaker 0>Well, your thought process is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.260
<v Speaker 0>You are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,100]}

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.000
<v Speaker 0>The answer to this is false.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.130
<v Speaker 0>This is not true in general, but it's one of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.940
<v Speaker 0>those that, uh, they're quite tricky to prove.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.670
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I tried to come up with a explicit

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.970

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.780
<v Speaker 0>So because I was expecting this to be more mixed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.210
<v Speaker 0>But you all seem confident that it's false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,99,100]}

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.470
<v Speaker 0>So how?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96]}

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.430
<v Speaker 0>I'm genuinely curious how how you got that.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.020

<v Speaker 0>Anyone?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.390
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.490
<v Speaker 0>Well, um, the way I, I went about doing that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 0>was, um, was to write explicitly to, to the two

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.800
<v Speaker 0>conditions and note that, uh, um, in general, the matrix

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.710
<v Speaker 0>that allows us to pass from A to B under

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.680

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.790
<v Speaker 0>not the same matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.060
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.010
<v Speaker 0>We cannot suppose in these two writings here that p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.320

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.550
<v Speaker 0>So we can't collect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.480
<v Speaker 0>We can collect p and q there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.660
<v Speaker 0>The problem with this proof is it looks like it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.380
<v Speaker 0>a sound proof, but it's incomplete because there could be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 0>another matrix that is not neither p nor q.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.920
<v Speaker 0>Another matrix U such that a plus c is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.760

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.810
<v Speaker 0>and proving that that that matrix does not exist is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,83,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 0>actually quite hard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.080
<v Speaker 0>So I decided not to include that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.100
<v Speaker 0>But your intuition is correct in the sense that, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180
<v Speaker 0>um, you can't uh, you can straight up collect that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.080
<v Speaker 0>And for that reason in general, there is some requirement

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.800

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.010
<v Speaker 0>to pass between the two pairs of matrices.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.750
<v Speaker 0>Uh, for this to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.850
<v Speaker 0>And finally, there is no matrix similar to the zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:44.660
<v Speaker 0>matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.640
<v Speaker 0>You know that a0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.240
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I pick it to be the matrix in which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.740
<v Speaker 0>will all entries are zero, and, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:01.820
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, you're about in the middle, except, uh, slim

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.400
<v Speaker 0>majority of you thinks it's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,91,97,100]}

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.960
<v Speaker 0>And this is actually false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.790
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.200
<v Speaker 0>I wrote true, but, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.030
<v Speaker 0>But but it's false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100]}

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.690
<v Speaker 0>And, uh, the zero matrix is similar only to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.630
<v Speaker 0>And you can see that because if you try to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 0>write out the definition, if you put a zero matrix

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.230

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well, the zero matrix multiply everything to zero.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.470
<v Speaker 0>So if you're trying to do a matrix multiplication that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,62,62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.350
<v Speaker 0>involves the matrix, all you're going to get is the

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.670

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:43.280
<v Speaker 0>So, um, this one, uh uh, perhaps I should have

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.130
<v Speaker 0>phrased it as there is no other matrix similar to

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.920
<v Speaker 0>the zero matrix, in the sense that the zero matrix

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.220

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:52.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.400
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any questions about any of these statements

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.610
<v Speaker 0>or any of the properties that we've seen about matrix

<v Speaker 0>Nope.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.930
<v Speaker 0>In that case, let's move on to, uh, question number

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.670

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.210
<v Speaker 0>order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.260
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

<v Speaker 0>Um, this was the proof of, uh, I don't remember

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.380

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.910

<v Speaker 0>I just want to make a few comments along the

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.920

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.000
<v Speaker 0>why some of the steps need to be in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.760
<v Speaker 0>order and not another order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.680
<v Speaker 0>And also this proof has, uh, the pleasant property that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.650
<v Speaker 0>unlike the ones from the last two times, there's only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:00.360
<v Speaker 0>one sort of correct solution into the to the reordering

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.170
<v Speaker 0>assignment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.230
<v Speaker 0>So I'll give you a couple of minutes to work

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.920
<v Speaker 0>through it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.700
<v Speaker 0>Um, ideally, I would like you to focus on the

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.820

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.180
<v Speaker 0>Uh, I don't particularly mind if you get a few

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.810
<v Speaker 0>wrong, but really trying to focus your attention on why

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.110
<v Speaker 0>does this step necessarily follow this one?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.580
<v Speaker 0>Why does this step.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.250
<v Speaker 0>Why can't this step go before this one?

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.080
<v Speaker 0>Try to reconstruct so that the logical flow of things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:42.990
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.530
<v Speaker 0>It's usual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35,85]}

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.990
<v Speaker 0>Like, uh, this gas compare.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,52,55,55,100]}

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.160
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.480
<v Speaker 0>Very welcome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.280
<v Speaker 0>So if you want to jot it down for your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.900
<v Speaker 0>This is a part of the proof of theorem 5.5.1.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.480
<v Speaker 0>So if you if you need to have a look

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.150
<v Speaker 0>at it later, you can find it quickly.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.250
<v Speaker 0>Slowly trying to make her way through the proof.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:58.840
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.640
<v Speaker 0>Well, this one isn't at this point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,72,100,98]}

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.320
<v Speaker 0>One isn't really saying anything, is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.500
<v Speaker 0>We're just, uh, clearly stating what we need to prove.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.640
<v Speaker 0>What's our thesis?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, we we are assuming the two matrices are similar,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.050
<v Speaker 0>and we want to show that they have the same

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.430
<v Speaker 0>eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:22.570
<v Speaker 0>And I just wrote out, uh, wrote out the set

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.380
<v Speaker 0>of the two, uh, of the eigenvalues of the two

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.220
<v Speaker 0>matrices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.050
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:30.010
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.480
<v Speaker 0>What the first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.040
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at the first, uh, um, real

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.490
<v Speaker 0>step of the proof, which is step two, which, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.470
<v Speaker 0>It's a sleight of hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 0>Instead of proving something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.300
<v Speaker 0>We're proving something else that implies what we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:46.600
<v Speaker 0>prove.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.400
<v Speaker 0>Once again, a classic trick in mathematical proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.600
<v Speaker 0>Because the eigenvalues, the eigenvalues are the roots of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.100
<v Speaker 0>characteristic polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.880
<v Speaker 0>If we show that the matrices have the same characteristic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.330
<v Speaker 0>polynomial, uh, two polynomials that are the same will have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.420
<v Speaker 0>the same roots, of course, and so the two matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.790
<v Speaker 0>will have the same eigenvalues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.850
<v Speaker 0>So this was the first point that I wanted to,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.070
<v Speaker 0>uh, to hammer home.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.970
<v Speaker 0>Um, this is uh, prove something else instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.520
<v Speaker 0>That then automatically proves what you want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.400
<v Speaker 0>In fact, in this proof, we won't even talk about,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.070
<v Speaker 0>uh, eigenvalues anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.590
<v Speaker 0>We just limit the discussion to about eigenvalues two, noting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,71,100]}

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.510
<v Speaker 0>that two implies one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.960
<v Speaker 0>And then we forget completely about eigenvalues, which I thought

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.260
<v Speaker 0>was really interesting because in principle you think that this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.260
<v Speaker 0>proof is just messing around with eigenvalues until you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.850
<v Speaker 0>something useful out of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.640
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.490
<v Speaker 0>Step number three doesn't really add much to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.600
<v Speaker 0>It's just the definition of what the characteristic polynomial polynomial

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.260
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:05.380
<v Speaker 0>And now we feed into this into this definition the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.310
<v Speaker 0>hypothesis of the of the of the theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.860
<v Speaker 0>Now we know that be similar to a and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.880
<v Speaker 0>this a here can be written as uh the similarity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51,100,100]}

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.790
<v Speaker 0>definition as a function of b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.230
<v Speaker 0>This step I want to break down into two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.460
<v Speaker 0>But then I left it in just because the identity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.380
<v Speaker 0>matrix is so is so simple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.580
<v Speaker 0>What I've done here is I multiplied only the last

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.270
<v Speaker 0>term here to the right by p minus one p,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.830
<v Speaker 0>which is the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.100
<v Speaker 0>So I'm not really changing that term anymore because here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.240
<v Speaker 0>what I'm saying is x minus x identity is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.610
<v Speaker 0>to minus x identity times the identity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.640
<v Speaker 0>Again because the identity is essentially just like multiplying by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,76,100,100]}

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.090
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.820
<v Speaker 0>And then I say because the identity I can write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.670
<v Speaker 0>that second identity as p minus one p by the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.740
<v Speaker 0>definition of the inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.710
<v Speaker 0>And now the identity matrix commutes with every other matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.120
<v Speaker 0>So what was originally x I p minus one p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.660
<v Speaker 0>becomes x p minus 1IP.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100]}

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.640
<v Speaker 0>Uh, might have uh, might have been better if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,68,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.960
<v Speaker 0>had split that step up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.400
<v Speaker 0>But again, we're comfortable with working with the identity by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,97,100,100,100,100,82]}

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.760
<v Speaker 0>now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:26.450
<v Speaker 0>Then we can use associativity Collect the terms that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.650
<v Speaker 0>before and after the interesting bit, which will be b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.630
<v Speaker 0>minus x I x I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,100,100]}

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.200
<v Speaker 0>We see that both terms are multiplied by p minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.180
<v Speaker 0>one on the left and p on the right, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.080
<v Speaker 0>we can collect.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:46.730
<v Speaker 0>And then we use the the property of the determinant

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.950
<v Speaker 0>that the determinant of the product of matrices is just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.270
<v Speaker 0>the product of determinants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:55.280
<v Speaker 0>And now we have directly related the expression of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.670
<v Speaker 0>CA with the expression of CB through their definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,95,100,100,96,100,99,100]}

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.970
<v Speaker 0>So everything that we left to do is to show

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.660
<v Speaker 0>that any remaining terms that we have inputted during the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.750
<v Speaker 0>way they simplify to one, and indeed they do, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.660
<v Speaker 0>the determinant of the inverse of a certain matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.680
<v Speaker 0>one over the determinant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,75]}

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.780
<v Speaker 0>So they so they simplify.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.380
<v Speaker 0>So k is equal to the determinant of only this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,38,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.220
<v Speaker 0>thing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.470
<v Speaker 0>But that is the expression of CB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.930
<v Speaker 0>And so we conclude by 0.2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75]}

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.750
<v Speaker 0>So two things to bring home.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.100
<v Speaker 0>The first one I already said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.250
<v Speaker 0>The second one is about recreating the structure that we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.970
<v Speaker 0>interested in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.140
<v Speaker 0>In a way we're using this two way relations from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 0>CA to the determinant of a minus x I and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 0>from CB to the to, to this determinant here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,98,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.880
<v Speaker 0>And so the relation between CA and CB is written

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.660
<v Speaker 0>through uh through this quantity here that we can then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.160
<v Speaker 0>manipulate, uh, using the properties of the determinant which do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.180
<v Speaker 0>not otherwise apply to um, to polynomials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.630
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, the polynomials of this matrix, uh, we can't really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39,100,100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.500
<v Speaker 0>say, uh, we can't really say if it's the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,62,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.890
<v Speaker 0>as the polynomial of uh, CB directly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:20.690
<v Speaker 0>So again, a two standard way of doing the proofs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,32,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.040
<v Speaker 0>Um, which are really the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:27.690
<v Speaker 0>If it's something is difficult to prove, you can always

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:33.060
<v Speaker 0>change to something else which is better suited for your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.960
<v Speaker 0>intentions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.460
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.500
<v Speaker 0>And in the very same spirit of this, I have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.150
<v Speaker 0>prepared a new question, which is a brainstorm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.800
<v Speaker 0>And what I'm asking you to do is to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:58.530
<v Speaker 0>down, uh, various possible options that complete, uh, these, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:03.240
<v Speaker 0>these two very common, uh, conditions in linear algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:03.480
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.110
<v Speaker 0>So, um, as an example, we've just seen if A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.160
<v Speaker 0>similar to B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69]}

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.570
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.950
<v Speaker 0>B similar to a would be one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.070
<v Speaker 0>But um, for for example, another one that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:18.720
<v Speaker 0>just seen would be eigenvalues of A equals eigenvalues of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.080
<v Speaker 0>B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 0>And I've done this for something in the in in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.870
<v Speaker 0>today in, in this week's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.110
<v Speaker 0>But also something from from from last lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.220
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.240
<v Speaker 0>From last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.550
<v Speaker 0>Just because this is also very important property.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.370
<v Speaker 0>And I think it's a useful exercise to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.400
<v Speaker 0>how different property relates.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.430
<v Speaker 0>I am going to leave the solutions on the board

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.420
<v Speaker 0>because I'm going to ask you to, instead of keeping

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.580
<v Speaker 0>writing down everything so that we have 100 different lines

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.030
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.980
<v Speaker 0>If you see something that you are going to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100]}

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.170
<v Speaker 0>anyway, you can just like the comment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.740
<v Speaker 0>And so the top one will rise to the one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,38]}

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.750
<v Speaker 0>rise at the top, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,70,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.960
<v Speaker 0>And also give some love to number two as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 0>I can see that you're all focussed on similarity, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.879
<v Speaker 0>give the full rank properties and love.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.919
<v Speaker 0>And again, this exercise really relies on you discussing with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:28.860
<v Speaker 0>someone else because you might not remember all properties, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.850
<v Speaker 0>hopefully together with your two neighbours or three neighbours, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,97,100]}

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:36.210
<v Speaker 0>will, you will be able to reconstruct most of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.899
<v Speaker 0>I have uh, I think I have written down five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:43.110
<v Speaker 0>for the first one for the similarity, and I've written

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.780
<v Speaker 0>down eight for the second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.720
<v Speaker 0>So a property of a matrix being full rank is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 0>connected to a lot of stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:56.100
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if you, uh, collectively get all eight that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:56.909
<v Speaker 0>I've written down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 0>And I'm sure you will get more that I didn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.610
<v Speaker 0>think of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look to at which properties you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.540
<v Speaker 0>have found out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.110
<v Speaker 0>So B is similar to a uh, second one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.550
<v Speaker 0>I'm not sure it's a property of A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.530
<v Speaker 0>You're just multiplying it many times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.680
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the determinants are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:47.950
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.250
<v Speaker 0>That was part of the theorem 5.5.1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.420
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the inverses of the matrix of the two matrices

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.410
<v Speaker 0>are also similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.670
<v Speaker 0>That's an excellent one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.490
<v Speaker 0>That's actually part of the next exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.110
<v Speaker 0>So well done for spotting that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.960
<v Speaker 0>Um, the determinants are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I would need to think about it.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.590

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.010

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.160

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.940
<v Speaker 0>immediately, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:12.380
<v Speaker 0>Because, uh, because, um, um, then B has the same

<v Speaker 0>rank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.110
<v Speaker 0>So it's full rank and so they both spam the

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:08.660
<v Speaker 0>Be careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.820
<v Speaker 0>This was in the very first workshop.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.590
<v Speaker 0>Be careful with words in mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.660
<v Speaker 0>What does this act will be has a as a

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.470
<v Speaker 0>solution mean?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.990
<v Speaker 0>It could be interpreted as it has at least one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.870
<v Speaker 0>solution, or it has exactly one solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.600
<v Speaker 0>So careful with the with how you phrase thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.700
<v Speaker 0>The correct version here is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.540
<v Speaker 0>At least or exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.570
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.880
<v Speaker 0>You can write it out by multiplying a minus one

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.660
<v Speaker 0>on the left right x equal a minus one times

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.080
<v Speaker 0>b, and because a minus one is uniquely defined, a

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.530

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.660
<v Speaker 0>So it has exactly one solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.720
<v Speaker 0>And you can actually write it out columns in independent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.530
<v Speaker 0>And then yes I can see you've got most of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.650
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.210
<v Speaker 0>Right okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.860
<v Speaker 0>So these are the eight ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75]}

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.270

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.840
<v Speaker 0>Now I was planning oh yeah okay.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.410

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:24.270
<v Speaker 0>Because I think it's helpful to understand how they work.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.170
<v Speaker 0>From an algebraic point of view, and this is not

<v Speaker 0>What are we doing in this representation when we're talking

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.450
<v Speaker 0>a different in a number of different subset of that

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.830
<v Speaker 0>bigger picture there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.320
<v Speaker 0>And each of these slices, and they are the set

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.850

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:37.440
<v Speaker 0>one that are in the same slice.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.650
<v Speaker 0>So for example, we we can prove that the diagonal

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:46.410

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.690
<v Speaker 0>So they live in the same slice.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:54.030

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.560
<v Speaker 0>similar to the identity matrix because it's not invertible.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.360
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't have the same rank.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.970
<v Speaker 0>And so it lives in another slice of the space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:04.110
<v Speaker 0>And there are two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.000
<v Speaker 0>Oh, and finally the zero matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 0>We've shown that it's similar only to itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.970
<v Speaker 0>So the set of all matrix n times n that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,49,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.180
<v Speaker 0>are similar to the zero matrix is the set that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.760
<v Speaker 0>contains only the zero matrix itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:18.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, why is this interesting?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.480
<v Speaker 0>Well, there's really two properties that are interesting here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:29.250
<v Speaker 0>The first one is now the three characteristic that we've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:29.880
<v Speaker 0>seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.380
<v Speaker 0>Uh, reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity means that each matrix is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.470
<v Speaker 0>in one and only one of these partitions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.170
<v Speaker 0>This matrix cannot be both here and here because otherwise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.270
<v Speaker 0>these two slices must be the same one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.660
<v Speaker 0>And this is something that you will see much better

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.270
<v Speaker 0>when you see a course in theoretical algebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.690
<v Speaker 0>But I think it's just, uh, uh, too nice of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,28,67,100,100,100]}

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.470
<v Speaker 0>an example to, um, to let it slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.960
<v Speaker 0>And the other one is that every single matrix n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.140
<v Speaker 0>times n that you can come up with is in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.820
<v Speaker 0>one of these slices here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:11.350
<v Speaker 0>And so this nicely, completely cover the set of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:17.740
<v Speaker 0>the matrices that exist in this group here, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.920
<v Speaker 0>all the square matrices n times n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.730
<v Speaker 0>So this is again not part of this course and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.440

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,63,100]}

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 0>But I just wanted to give you this picture because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.500
<v Speaker 0>you will see this again further down the line and

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.770
<v Speaker 0>sort of start to build your understanding on how equivalence

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:40.630
<v Speaker 0>relation work in terms of the big picture of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:49.000
<v Speaker 0>Next up, because uh, uh, we've been going on for

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 0>quite some time, I'm going to skip the lecture summary

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.170
<v Speaker 0>and move straight to question five instead.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.900
<v Speaker 0>Question five is uh, just like last, uh, last, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.370
<v Speaker 0>last week, uh, you're not supposed to pick all five.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.310
<v Speaker 0>Just pick the ones you're confident with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:15.220
<v Speaker 0>According to the, um, to the traffic line symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.990
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is supposed to be yellow, but some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,79]}

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.890
<v Speaker 0>this is yellow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.020
<v Speaker 0>It just looks very much red.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, you can pick whichever difficulty you want, and I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.450
<v Speaker 0>going to go through all of them in a couple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.230
<v Speaker 0>of minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 0>But you really drill down, uh, to one of 1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.780
<v Speaker 0>or 2 of them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.570
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at the first one, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.400
<v Speaker 0>we only have a few minutes left to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,96]}

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.430
<v Speaker 0>This one says if the rank is different, then they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 0>can be similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.890
<v Speaker 0>And this once again is the contrapositive, uh, trick that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:49.910
<v Speaker 0>I pulled on you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we saw in the previous theorem that if two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.580
<v Speaker 0>matrices are similar, that the rank must be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.940
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so if the rank is not the same, they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.460
<v Speaker 0>can't possibly be similar.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:02.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.620
<v Speaker 0>And, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:11.330
<v Speaker 0>Statement two was an observation to theorem 5.5.1, which was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:17.180
<v Speaker 0>that uh similarity preserve the eigenvalues, but not the eigenvectors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.030
<v Speaker 0>And the reasoning behind it was exactly that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:24.440
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we're seeing the same linear transformation in different basis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.150
<v Speaker 0>So, um, I've shown you this in the in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:34.040
<v Speaker 0>reading video, if x is a eigenvector associated to a

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.330
<v Speaker 0>with eigenvalue lambda, then the eigenvector associated to lambda and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,68]}

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:41.240
<v Speaker 0>b uh transforms with p minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,52,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.690
<v Speaker 0>So p minus one x is the corresponding eigenvector.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:50.600
<v Speaker 0>And uh I didn't include it in this, but I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.670
<v Speaker 0>invite you to try a counterexample.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:57.230
<v Speaker 0>And uh, this is one of those easy counterexample to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,76,100]}

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.040
<v Speaker 0>to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.940
<v Speaker 0>Because if you just throw down a random matrix, chances

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.790
<v Speaker 0>are that the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors will not be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.330
<v Speaker 0>same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.130
<v Speaker 0>You need to be extremely lucky to pick by chance

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.000
<v Speaker 0>a matrix.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100]}

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.260
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well, two similar matrices for which this is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49]}

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:16.980
<v Speaker 0>is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.290
<v Speaker 0>You have to pick them essentially in such a way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:23.490
<v Speaker 0>that, uh, x is an eigenvalue, is an eigenvector of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.260
<v Speaker 0>p one of p minus one as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.610
<v Speaker 0>So if that is true then obviously a p minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,68,100,100]}

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:33.450
<v Speaker 0>one x is aligned with x because you get p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:35.130
<v Speaker 0>minus one x equals lambda x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,50,100,100]}

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.050
<v Speaker 0>But otherwise you're safe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.740
<v Speaker 0>Uh next up, if A is diagonalisable then A is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.720
<v Speaker 0>similar to its transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,95]}

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.840
<v Speaker 0>And this one is true, although I put it down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.450
<v Speaker 0>as an orange because it requires a little bit of,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.710
<v Speaker 0>um, quite a bit more of, uh, manipulation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,43,100]}

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.630
<v Speaker 0>And the first bit is easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:05.850
<v Speaker 0>Um, if ace is diagonalisable, then we can transform it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:08.370
<v Speaker 0>into a matrix D, which is orthogonal, which was the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.330
<v Speaker 0>main result of the diagonalization theorem that we've seen, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.980
<v Speaker 0>a few weeks ago.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.920
<v Speaker 0>And then we can invert this relation by multiplying p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.050
<v Speaker 0>minus one on the left, p on the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 0>And next we can transpose, uh, this whole thing and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:30.000
<v Speaker 0>we get the a transpose is PD p minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100]}

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.840
<v Speaker 0>transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.270
<v Speaker 0>But we know that taking the transpose of a product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.940
<v Speaker 0>is equal to taking the product of the transpose in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 0>the opposite direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.290
<v Speaker 0>So taking the transpose of p d, p minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 0>is actually the same thing as doing p minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.000
<v Speaker 0>transpose d transpose p transposed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.910
<v Speaker 0>But d transpose is the same as d because it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 0>diagonal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.620
<v Speaker 0>So if you switch rows and columns, the diagonal stays

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.340
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.470
<v Speaker 0>And now you have these two relations and you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:01.800
<v Speaker 0>take this D here and put it in here essentially.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.740
<v Speaker 0>That's what what what we're doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.480
<v Speaker 0>And then you you regroup and you see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.680
<v Speaker 0>You also know that when you take an inverse of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.830
<v Speaker 0>a product, it's also the same as taking the product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.160
<v Speaker 0>of the inverses but in the reverse order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.580
<v Speaker 0>So you can collect this to be p t p

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,95,68]}

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.020
<v Speaker 0>p t minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.790
<v Speaker 0>And so a, t and a are related by through

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.790
<v Speaker 0>similarity by the matrix p p transpose.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.160
<v Speaker 0>And you know that the transpose of the invertible matrix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.150
<v Speaker 0>is invertible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:40.260
<v Speaker 0>And you can know that from the fact, for example,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.030
<v Speaker 0>that, uh, uh, if A is invertible, its full rank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,75,100,100,100,100,71,100,100]}

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:49.080
<v Speaker 0>So the span of the columns is uh n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.960
<v Speaker 0>And so the span of the rows of T is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.530
<v Speaker 0>also n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.260
<v Speaker 0>But the span of the rows of 80 is uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,72]}

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.340
<v Speaker 0>the rank itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.240
<v Speaker 0>So its full rank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,100,100]}

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.380
<v Speaker 0>So 80 also works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100]}

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, also works that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,48,87]}

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.620
<v Speaker 0>And so we conclude that this is in fact true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.230
<v Speaker 0>And it's 101.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85]}

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.660
<v Speaker 0>So I'm going to call it a day for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.650
<v Speaker 0>last two ones.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.840
<v Speaker 0>We are going to do them first thing tomorrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,61,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}
