00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.490

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.500

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.690
<v Speaker 0>The voting is a little slow.

<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.810

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 0>we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 0>It's a little slow, so I'll give you one minute

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.170
<v Speaker 0>and then we will discuss the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.610

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.710

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.950
<v Speaker 0>The results.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,99]}

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.030
<v Speaker 0>So the correct answer is was chosen by the majority,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 0>but there were some, uh, there were some, um, votes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 0>for, uh, the the others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100]}

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.510
<v Speaker 0>So let's discuss the problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.540
<v Speaker 0>So what do we have here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.660
<v Speaker 0>What kind of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 0>So this is clearly an optimisation problem right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.060
<v Speaker 0>So we need to find the maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 0>We're giving the we're given the function and we want

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 0>to find the maximum value of that function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,49,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 0>But there are some constraints here right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 0>This is not just so x is allowed to take

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Speaker 0>particular values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.180
<v Speaker 0>It's not allowed to take just any value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.900
<v Speaker 0>And moreover since this is the revenue function and we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.660
<v Speaker 0>interested in the maximal value of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.540
<v Speaker 0>Well, I mean it would be pretty bad if we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.220
<v Speaker 0>had negative maximal revenue, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100]}

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 0>That would be terrible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 0>So there are some constraints on this problem, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 0>So since x is the number of sold units.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.600
<v Speaker 0>Can you please be quiet?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 0>It's hard for me to speak, let alone scream.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.320
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.440
<v Speaker 0>Um, so X is the number of units sold, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.320
<v Speaker 0>therefore it has to be non-negative, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,73]}

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 0>You can't sell negative units.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 0>Uh, also the the revenue has to be non-negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,99,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 0>As I said, we don't want a negative revenue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.800
<v Speaker 0>So we have two inequalities here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.240
<v Speaker 0>We have two constraints here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.160
<v Speaker 0>X is non-negative and this thing is non-negative right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.200
<v Speaker 0>So solving this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.040
<v Speaker 0>This part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 0>900 -60 times x to the power one over three

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 0>gives you that x has to be less than this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.760
<v Speaker 0>number 3375.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 0>I'll just, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,91]}

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.180
<v Speaker 0>Quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 0>Uh, quickly, uh, show you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.020
<v Speaker 0>I mean, it's I'm pretty sure you can do it,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.860
<v Speaker 0>but just to, you know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 0>So we need, uh, 900 -60.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100,100]}

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.500
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that is what, am I, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh, yeah, I am.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,94,100,100]}

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.100
<v Speaker 0>And then, uh, from here, you obtain that X has

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.620
<v Speaker 0>to be less than or equal to this number.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.700
<v Speaker 0>So, um, so what did we find?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.900
<v Speaker 0>We found that we have an optimisation problem on a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:46.690
<v Speaker 0>closed bounded interval, which is good because we can use

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.250
<v Speaker 0>one of my favourite theorems extreme value theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.170
<v Speaker 0>So when you have a function that is continuous and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.970
<v Speaker 0>this is a continuous function on a closed bounded interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so in this case it's the interval from 0

NOTE CONF {"raw":[43,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.450
<v Speaker 0>to 3 3375.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100]}

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.290
<v Speaker 0>Then to find its absolute maximum you have to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 0>two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.370
<v Speaker 0>You have to find the critical points which I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.690
<v Speaker 0>I assume that's what you did and how you got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 0>the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 0>But also don't forget to see what happens at critical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 0>points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 0>Sorry at the end points of the interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:32.530
<v Speaker 0>So at the point zero and 3375 right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.250
<v Speaker 0>So this is what we do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.610
<v Speaker 0>Luckily at the end points we have zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,81,100,100,100]}

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 0>So therefore uh we the maximum will be found among

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,94,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 0>the critical points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:52.150
<v Speaker 0>And when we set the derivative equal to zero, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.670
<v Speaker 0>get x equals 1000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.230
<v Speaker 0>As the only critical point right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:04.270
<v Speaker 0>And then we evaluate the function at that point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 0>get 3000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 0>Let me just perhaps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93]}

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 0>So the function is 900 -60 x over three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.550
<v Speaker 0>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:23.430
<v Speaker 0>So so we have to set that equal to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.069
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.670
<v Speaker 0>Take the derivative and set that equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.830
<v Speaker 0>So what's the derivative there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:39.630
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 0>But, uh, there's something I don't like about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:47.970
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that's not the right function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.210
<v Speaker 0>This is the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:57.890
<v Speaker 0>Cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.930
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.810
<v Speaker 0>So how to take the derivative 900 times two over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:13.330
<v Speaker 0>3X2 over three minus one star equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,45,99,100]}

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:14.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 0>So 600.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.490
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 0>It goes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,85]}

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.090
<v Speaker 0>Ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 0>And that gives you a uh that gives you x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,41,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 0>equals 1000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86]}

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.530
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 0>So let me zoom out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.110
<v Speaker 0>So right there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.870
<v Speaker 0>There you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.670
<v Speaker 0>And then this is the value that you plug into

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.870
<v Speaker 0>the original function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.150
<v Speaker 0>And you find three 30,000 is the maximum revenue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.990
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.430
<v Speaker 0>Uh right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 0>So if there are no questions let's move on to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.550
<v Speaker 0>another optimisation problem which will be slightly different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 0>Oh right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.510
<v Speaker 0>So I also sketched the graph for you and forgot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 0>about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 0>But I didn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.030
<v Speaker 0>But I included it here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 0>So this is what the graph of this function revenue

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 0>function looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.830
<v Speaker 0>And you can convince yourself that indeed uh, at the

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.190
<v Speaker 0>point 1000 you get the global maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.820
<v Speaker 0>Question number two Find the two positive numbers whose product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.460
<v Speaker 0>And I will display it on up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75]}

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.580
<v Speaker 0>There.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.100
<v Speaker 0>Look at the results.

<v Speaker 0>Good.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.760
<v Speaker 0>And that is indeed the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.520
<v Speaker 0>But I would like you to think about how this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 0>optimisation problem is different from the previous one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 0>So when we approach the solution, I think probably you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 0>denoted the numbers by x and 750 divided by x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.560
<v Speaker 0>and then you are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93]}

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 0>So you uh wrote down this function which you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.800
<v Speaker 0>to minimise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.440
<v Speaker 0>However, you know this time we have no constraints on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.120
<v Speaker 0>X except that it's positive, but it's not uh, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.840
<v Speaker 0>not on a bounded interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.480
<v Speaker 0>So this is an an optimisation problem on an unbounded

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.580
<v Speaker 0>interval, because x can take B any number between zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Speaker 0>and infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, so uh, so we cannot use the extreme value

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.580
<v Speaker 0>theorem because that one required a closed bounded interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 0>So what do we do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.140
<v Speaker 0>Well, uh, we can just investigate the behaviour of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.820
<v Speaker 0>function, uh, using the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:54.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, so first we find the critical points, and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.340
<v Speaker 0>turns out it only has one critical point on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.700
<v Speaker 0>entire, um, sorry, positive real line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,55,100,76,100]}

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so how do we know what kind of critical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.020
<v Speaker 0>point this is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 0>Is this a how do we know the nature of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.900
<v Speaker 0>this critical point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 0>How did you determine that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.460
<v Speaker 0>How did you know this was the minimum?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.980
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's a good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.410
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, that's that's a good strategy as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 0>But there is also something else you can do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.530
<v Speaker 0>When you find a critical point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.690
<v Speaker 0>How do you determine the nature of it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.290
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 0>Second derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.050
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.490
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 0>You can do exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.290
<v Speaker 0>Those two will work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.610
<v Speaker 0>So you can sketch and investigate the the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 0>But you can also do the second derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.890
<v Speaker 0>So computing the second derivative gives you the following number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.690
<v Speaker 0>And since x is positive you know x can only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 0>take positive values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.930
<v Speaker 0>This will be positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.890
<v Speaker 0>That means that in particular it will be positive at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.770
<v Speaker 0>the point that you found.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.170
<v Speaker 0>So you have found yourself a local minimum, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:33.470
<v Speaker 0>And uh, so again the second derivative is positive everywhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.590
<v Speaker 0>on the interval of interest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.750
<v Speaker 0>And we conclude that the graph of the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.470
<v Speaker 0>concave up right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79]}

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.430
<v Speaker 0>So this is the absolute minimum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 0>So not only is it the local minimum because the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.550
<v Speaker 0>second derivative test gives you a local information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:55.190
<v Speaker 0>But since you know you know that this second derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.510
<v Speaker 0>is positive everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.390
<v Speaker 0>So you know that the graph of the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.710
<v Speaker 0>concave up like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 0>And therefore the point that you found is absolute minimum,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.150
<v Speaker 0>not just the local minimum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 0>Alternatively, as you suggested, we can do something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:24.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we can uh, find the first derivative and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.030
<v Speaker 0>gives us the following expression.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.190
<v Speaker 0>And then we can look at the signs of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.410
<v Speaker 0>And that will tell us about the behaviour of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100]}

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.130
<v Speaker 0>function where it's increasing, where it's decreasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:43.170
<v Speaker 0>And uh, so um, since it's positive on this interval

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:49.410
<v Speaker 0>zero and then negative, uh, here we see that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:49.730
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.650
<v Speaker 0>So the function starts decreasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:55.730
<v Speaker 0>Decreasing reaches this point 50 times square root of three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.330
<v Speaker 0>and then starts increasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.130
<v Speaker 0>So it is a it is the absolute minimum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:03.690
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.690
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 0>Now the next question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.010
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's try to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.570
<v Speaker 0>Solve this together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.530
<v Speaker 0>Let's first look at the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.090
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, the results are good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.810
<v Speaker 0>And that's indeed the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.430
<v Speaker 0>So, Uh, let's see how we can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.910
<v Speaker 0>Solve this one together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, I want you to pay attention to some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.070
<v Speaker 0>things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:39.270
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, that, uh, what is, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:44.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we have the limit as x goes to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.870
<v Speaker 0>pi over two from the left of ten x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.590
<v Speaker 0>To the power of cosine x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:58.310
<v Speaker 0>So notice that, uh, when pi of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,77]}

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.910
<v Speaker 0>So when x goes to pi over two from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 0>left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:08.750
<v Speaker 0>This is positive because ten x is sine x over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 0>cosine x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.470
<v Speaker 0>And as long as these two stay in the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.110
<v Speaker 0>quadrant this is non negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,97]}

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.980
<v Speaker 0>So this is a Positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:20.900
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.140

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:34.020
<v Speaker 0>Um, as, uh, as you approach pi over pi over

<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.860

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.820
<v Speaker 0>So this is kind of limit of this kind.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 0>Here because uh ten goes to infinity because the the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.540
<v Speaker 0>So you get a limit of this kind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.300
<v Speaker 0>And this is the so-called one of the so-called indeterminate

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.560

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.400
<v Speaker 0>So if you take the limit of this thing.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:12.760

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 0>it's the same as.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:28.900

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.940
<v Speaker 0>So this will go to infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.180
<v Speaker 0>You can write it in this form.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:02.140
<v Speaker 0>So now you have infinity over infinity which you know

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.700

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.300
<v Speaker 0>So let me just write it out here.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:11.540
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 0>Then this is the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.130
<v Speaker 0>So this is a one sided limit.

<v Speaker 0>So, uh.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.770
<v Speaker 0>So I'm taking the derivative.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.460
<v Speaker 0>And that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 0>So what you do is when you deal with a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 0>limit like this, you get rid of the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 0>So so you try to obtain some kind of, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 0>uh, so some kind of constants in the numerator and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 0>denominator denominator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:11.050
<v Speaker 0>And uh, so if you perform these operations, you will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:16.450
<v Speaker 0>see that you will get a very quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.730
<v Speaker 0>Let me do the docker.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100]}

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.330
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:26.370
<v Speaker 0>I started writing something for you already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:30.370
<v Speaker 0>So once you multiply everything by this number, you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:36.690
<v Speaker 0>something, you get this expression, and then you get three

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.050
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:42.290
<v Speaker 0>The two here or two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,76,100]}

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.850
<v Speaker 0>And so what you obtain is that these guys go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:48.690
<v Speaker 0>to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:55.210
<v Speaker 0>And you, you are left with minus one over two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 0>As t goes to infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.730
<v Speaker 0>This is a negative power.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:00.690
<v Speaker 0>It goes to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:01.530
<v Speaker 0>This goes to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:02.490
<v Speaker 0>This goes to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.850
<v Speaker 0>So you can apply the quotient rule because these limits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.430
<v Speaker 0>exist and you get minus one over two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:12.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay, that's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:13.430
<v Speaker 0>That was all for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}
