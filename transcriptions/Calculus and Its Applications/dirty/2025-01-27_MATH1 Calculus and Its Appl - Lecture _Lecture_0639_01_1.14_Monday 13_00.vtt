<v Speaker 0>Hi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 0>So before we start today, I want to give a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 0>shout out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,33]}

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 0>I want to give a shout out to Matt's pulse.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 0>for PPS.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,44]}

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 0>And these are your fellow students in further years down

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 0>the line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 0>That will help you with any questions that you may

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 0>have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 0>They are the details.

<v Speaker 0>That's the QR code.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,98]}

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.200
<v Speaker 0>I will put this PDF on the learn page so

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 0>you can kind of access it and have a look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 0>I would strongly recommend you take support when you need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 0>So don't wait for two weeks before the exam to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 0>think, oh my god, I never understood derivatives, But take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 0>all the supports that you can get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,91,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 0>We have workshops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 0>You have math pals that you can access at these

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 0>dates and and hours in the at the.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 0>At the King building house.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,85,100,95]}

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 0>So do don't just sit there and think I cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 0>do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if I think back when I was a

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 0>first year student, which isn't quite yesterday, I think I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 0>could have done with all the supports that I could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100]}

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 0>have got.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 0>And so you have a lot of things that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 0>can access.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 0>So please do if you need them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 0>So this is week three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 0>Is there anybody that can volunteer me a quick recap

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 0>Given that I wasn't here.

<v Speaker 0>week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 0>Not much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Oh, limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83]}

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 0>So do you want to say three words about limits?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,97]}

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 0>Wait wait wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 0>Hey, I'm in the mic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,99]}

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh I know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100]}

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Limits from both sides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100]}

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>From the right and left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh, we checked if they exist and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,56,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay, let.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 0>Me see about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,60,75]}

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody else add to this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 0>A show of hand if you think you have seen

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,67,100,100,100,88,88,100]}

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 0>continuity of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 0>So today we are going to get on a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 0>bit on this idea of limits and continuity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 0>And we are going to talk about derivatives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 0>As I often as I always do when I teach,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 0>I just want to have a couple of slides, five

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 0>minutes to recap on the things which are really important

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 0>on the chapter that you should have read for today,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 0>not that the rest is not important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 0>Everything is important, but these are things that other students

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.630
<v Speaker 0>As I know the student fund difficult or that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,93,33,98,100,100,100]}

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.790
<v Speaker 0>really important to remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what these are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 0>So the derivative at a point to a curve is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 0>the slope of the tangent line to that curve at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 0>that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 0>Now if you want to think about the all the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.710
<v Speaker 0>derivatives one curve with every point where is the derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,90,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.310
<v Speaker 0>exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 0>You could think about a family of straight lines that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,45,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 0>varies as the point varies on the curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.190
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to bring up Desmos now, but I've

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 0>made you like an animation that can show you this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.670
<v Speaker 0>tangent line that moves along a curve as the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 0>moves along the curve, and we think about the tangent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 0>line, or sometimes we think about the tangent line as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 0>if I have two points that intersect, say a second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 0>degree curve as these two points get very close.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 0>The line which is defined by these two points gets

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 0>very close to the tangent line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530
<v Speaker 0>Don't forget that for a tangent we need the curve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 0>and the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.810
<v Speaker 0>We also know because we should know this because you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.769
<v Speaker 0>have read it in in the chapter for today that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 0>I can think about the derivative as a rate of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 0>change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 0>So you can see how I can think about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 0>same mathematical objects in different ways.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.970
<v Speaker 0>So I can think of an object in a geometrical

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 0>way, if you like, which is this idea of like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 0>going to see the tangent line to the curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 0>But I can think about the derivative also in an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 0>analytical way, if you like, which is the process and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 0>the definition of the derivative, which we'll see in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 0>But I can also think in more, I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 0>say applied terms as the derivative as a rate of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,55,100,100]}

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 0>change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 0>And we will have a couple of exercises questions in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 0>book club today to see how we can think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 0>the derivative as the rate of change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,52,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 0>The things which are important to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 0>The derivative is a function in itself, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.950
<v Speaker 0>So this function may in itself have a derivative or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 0>may not have a derivative, will have a range and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 0>will have a domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 0>So in order to think about derivatives and say oh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.510
<v Speaker 0>I want to calculate the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.190
<v Speaker 0>And then I want to calculate the second degree derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100]}

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 0>Each time you need to think about this object that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,97,75]}

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.230
<v Speaker 0>you have in front of you as a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.510
<v Speaker 0>And so you need to go in and check whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 0>actually the second derivative exists given the first derivative and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.590
<v Speaker 0>all these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.990
<v Speaker 0>So the fact that the function has a first derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,35,61,100,100]}

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 0>doesn't really mean that the second or third the fourth

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,45,100]}

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 0>derivative will will exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 0>Each each derivative is a function in itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 0>So the calculation of the first derivative involves limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.550
<v Speaker 0>How do I calculate this while I take an increment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,56,91,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.590
<v Speaker 0>of a function which is usually of an x that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 0>which usually is h.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,99,77,96]}

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 0>I will put the formula up in one of my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.890
<v Speaker 0>exercises, and we see what happens when this increment becomes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.210
<v Speaker 0>smaller and smaller and smaller.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 0>Now, what is the idea here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 0>The idea is that a derivative exists to know if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 0>a derivative exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.010
<v Speaker 0>I need to think about limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 0>So my question does the derivative at this point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 0>this curve exists kind of bounces back as a question

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.410
<v Speaker 0>about limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 0>And we will see what are the conditions by which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 0>the derivative exists and what is the relative limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.490
<v Speaker 0>All the rules that we studied at school as rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,99,57,57,100,100]}

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 0>I have one I've got one up there just as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.010

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.690
<v Speaker 0>of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100]}

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 0>My first principle there I have an example where I

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 0>want to calculate the derivative of the second degree curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100]}

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.050
<v Speaker 0>Obviously you look at it and you say okay that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.480
<v Speaker 0>two x plus three, but why is it two x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.080
<v Speaker 0>plus three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 0>We studied the formula for polynomials, but that's actually showing

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.200
<v Speaker 0>from first principle y that is the derivative to the

<v Speaker 0>polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 0>So you need to think about it behind all these

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.840

<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.930
<v Speaker 0>I should really bring the other mic with me, but

<v Speaker 0>Next time.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.960
<v Speaker 3>then found the change in the height.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Um, well, specifically did the height at 1.5 seconds minus

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.520
<v Speaker 3>the height of one second divided by the difference in

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.960
<v Speaker 3>times is 0.5 seconds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,58,98,98]}

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.280
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at this a little bit more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.800
<v Speaker 0>Um, come formally on the board if you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,96,96,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 0>So as our colleague up there was saying, this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 0>exactly what we do, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 0>So we try to we start by calculated to find

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,52,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 0>the average velocity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 0>We need to calculate the displacement over time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.320
<v Speaker 0>And the displacement is the basically the length of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 0>segment h1 um h of one h of 1.5 divided

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.340
<v Speaker 0>the time, which is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 0>And then I find my solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.900
<v Speaker 0>Now let's think about this for one more moment, if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 0>that's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 0>So I could do this for a lot of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.900
<v Speaker 0>segments between the heights that I'm given.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if I want to do it on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.339
<v Speaker 0>one and 1.1, I obtain the first expression on one

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.660
<v Speaker 0>and 1.0, one the second expression, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.220
<v Speaker 0>I want to ask what is the limit of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.939
<v Speaker 0>expression as the interval becomes smaller and smaller?

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 0>What would this limit give me?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.060
<v Speaker 0>Why am I asking what is this limit apart from

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.620
<v Speaker 0>the fact that we've done limit last week?

<v Speaker 0>I will come.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100]}

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.640
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to say something?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Oh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,96]}

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.440
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 0>Not like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>I cannot hear you.

<v Speaker 0>Nobody else can hear you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.000
<v Speaker 0>This is better than going to the gym.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.160
<v Speaker 0>So you wanted to say something else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,100,100,69,49]}

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 0>Velocity, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.440
<v Speaker 4>And I also wanted to say that this will help

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.960
<v Speaker 4>us calculate the derivative of this function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.960
<v Speaker 0>So the reason why I'm asking you about this limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 0>is because I want to find eventually some sort of

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.360
<v Speaker 0>derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.480
<v Speaker 0>So let's go and have a look how I do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:22.880
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.120
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.860
<v Speaker 0>I do it in the way in which I do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.660
<v Speaker 0>a derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,100]}

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.020
<v Speaker 0>So in the first, in the first line, that's my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.180
<v Speaker 0>definition of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,100]}

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 0>No, you remember f you have f of x plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,71,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.020
<v Speaker 0>h minus f of x of h.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.540
<v Speaker 0>And this is your derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:04.420
<v Speaker 0>That's just that um formula for principles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,49]}

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 0>First principle applied to the function we have at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.300
<v Speaker 0>moment, which is the function h of t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 0>And that's the first derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 0>Now what that's going to think about if I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,70,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.220
<v Speaker 0>to think about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 0>So we said before that the derivative is a limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.660
<v Speaker 0>and it doesn't always exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 0>That's the formal definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 0>When does this derivative exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 0>Give them limits last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,89,100,100,100]}

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.660
<v Speaker 0>So you need to know this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.020
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 0>Now come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.180
<v Speaker 5>The graph is continuous at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 0>So this is an interesting answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.890
<v Speaker 0>The answer was the derivative exists when the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.130

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 0>How many people think that a continuous function means that

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.330

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.610

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 5>The the function can exist.

<v Speaker 5>Um, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80]}

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.290
<v Speaker 5>The it can be continuous, but if it's got if

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 5>it's like, uh, the tangent is vertical or there's a

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.050

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.550
<v Speaker 5>the limit approaching either side gives a different tangent or

<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.550
<v Speaker 0>Next time I'll bring the other mic.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.430
<v Speaker 0>So the fact that the function is continuous at one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.950

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.670
<v Speaker 0>If the function is not continuous, the derivative of that

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.710

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,98,100]}

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 0>But it's not sufficient because, as your colleague said, I

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.790

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 0>they don't have a derivative at that point.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.990
<v Speaker 0>And why could that be the case?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 0>Well, the derivative is a limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,88,47,93]}

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.070
<v Speaker 0>So in order for that limit, whatever it represents to

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.110

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.310

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 0>Then I obtain coming from the point zero to the

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.910
<v Speaker 2>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.770
<v Speaker 0>Before the derivative exists, I need to make sure that

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.290

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Ah yes.

<v Speaker 0>function there on my graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.170
<v Speaker 0>Are we happy to say that that function is continuous

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.650
<v Speaker 0>everywhere?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 0>Why is that continuous at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.010
<v Speaker 0>Who can tell me down here so I avoid another

<v Speaker 0>going up and down?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.490
<v Speaker 0>Why is the function continuous at zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.250
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to see.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.410
<v Speaker 6>Is equal to the limit from the left to the

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.610
<v Speaker 6>value to the value?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.490
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.950
<v Speaker 0>The function is continuous because if you go and say

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.150
<v Speaker 0>and do the limit of FFA of Fox to zero

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.910
<v Speaker 0>from the left and to the right, these limits are

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.230
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.910
<v Speaker 0>So the function is continuous at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,89,100]}

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.790
<v Speaker 0>However, that function does not have a derivative at zero.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 0>So you see how being continuous is a necessary condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.990
<v Speaker 0>If it is not continuous, forget it.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 0>But it's not sufficient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100]}

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 0>Something else must happen in order to have a derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's see what else can we do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.550
<v Speaker 0>So if I go back to my original question, which

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.510

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.950
<v Speaker 0>And I apply the rules of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.830
<v Speaker 0>I can calculate DDT of h of x, which we

<v Speaker 0>had done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100]}

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.790
<v Speaker 0>But if I calculate the acceleration I do a second

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.430
<v Speaker 0>degree derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.220
<v Speaker 0>So this is how in some sense we can connect

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.220
<v Speaker 0>this quite abstract idea of taking derivatives each time two

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.460

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.580

<v Speaker 0>There we are.

<v Speaker 2>Me.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Are we assuming that the arrow was shot, like, from

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Speaker 0>I think that's the right answer.

<v Speaker 0>Nobody volunteering.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.830
<v Speaker 0>So what do we need to do here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.550
<v Speaker 0>If you look at the equation of the height which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.230
<v Speaker 0>is h of t, which is how the height varies

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 0>with bearing of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100]}

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.990
<v Speaker 0>That equation is a second degree polynomial.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 0>So it's some sort of a parabola okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.470
<v Speaker 0>And it is some sort of a parabola with the

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 0>concavity of both like towards the, towards the bottom.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:14.430
<v Speaker 0>Because the first term because the square term is negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 0>So if I have a parabola and the term of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.070
<v Speaker 0>the x square is positive, the parabola has concavity towards

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 0>the top.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.430
<v Speaker 0>Otherwise it's concavity towards the bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:29.730
<v Speaker 0>So I assume that I shoot an arrow From the

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.170
<v Speaker 0>bow, from from the ground.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.890
<v Speaker 0>As your colleague has asked me, is exactly the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,89,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.490
<v Speaker 0>assumption.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.170
<v Speaker 0>So what happens?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:36.890
<v Speaker 0>I shoot the arrows.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.930
<v Speaker 0>The arrows does something, and then it gets back to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:39.570
<v Speaker 0>the ground.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 0>So at that time, at least two times.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.490
<v Speaker 0>So the start and the end, the height is zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 0>because the head has come up from the ground and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,56]}

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.330
<v Speaker 0>has done all its parabola and it's come back to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,82,100,99,100,100,37,100,100,100]}

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 0>the ground.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.170
<v Speaker 0>So I need to find out where that is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:55.570
<v Speaker 0>Zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 0>And that height is zero for these two values.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.290
<v Speaker 0>So the first value seems obvious because he's zero at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100]}

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.690
<v Speaker 0>the moment when I start, because I start from the

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.170
<v Speaker 0>ground.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.850
<v Speaker 0>And that's the second value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 0>And to find the velocity I just find the first

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 0>derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.050
<v Speaker 0>Does this make sense?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.410
<v Speaker 0>Are you happy with the outcome of this question or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.010
<v Speaker 0>is there anything you would like to ask?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:25.050
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.750
<v Speaker 0>Let's see what that's there is actually there is one

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.790
<v Speaker 0>more slide to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100]}

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.950
<v Speaker 0>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54]}

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 0>I think we discussed this at great length in the

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.990
<v Speaker 0>first week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.710
<v Speaker 0>I'm a big fan of being able to draw graphs.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.950
<v Speaker 0>The parabola you see in that picture is not the

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.470
<v Speaker 0>parabola described by this, by this equation of height, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.310
<v Speaker 0>I tried to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 0>And it's really weird.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 0>It's very narrow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.430
<v Speaker 0>I have to magnify a lot, but it's a parabola

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 0>which looks pretty much the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.230
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.190
<v Speaker 0>It's concavity there at the bottom and as a maximum

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,56,79,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 0>somewhere there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.150
<v Speaker 0>So if you see what happens to the R or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,67]}

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:11.030
<v Speaker 0>the arrow goes up and then changes direction right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.550
<v Speaker 0>So you shoot an arrow it comes down like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:19.110
<v Speaker 0>So at the top of the parabola the velocity is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.750
<v Speaker 0>zero okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.590
<v Speaker 0>And then it starts decreasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 0>So we can think about this exercise also in that

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.860
<v Speaker 0>So we can think about this as a slope of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 0>the tangent at the top.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.860
<v Speaker 0>The slope of the tangent is zero, because it's the

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.180
<v Speaker 0>parallel to the max point of the parabola is parallel

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.700
<v Speaker 0>to the x axis, so that the slope is zero,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.980
<v Speaker 0>and then it reverts back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.900
<v Speaker 0>If you try to picture yourself how these functions work,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.740
<v Speaker 0>or if you go into Desmos and do it in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.380
<v Speaker 0>Desmos, that's also fine that it really is going to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,94,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.340

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:58.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 0>And once you have learned how three or 4 or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,93,70,99,99]}

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 0>5 standard curves work, one of which is the parabola,

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 0>then you will be able to recall this and be

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.540

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:08.820
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 0>Can somebody tell me why they excluded zero.

<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.710
<v Speaker 7>Um, so going back to, um, first principles where, like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:55.550
<v Speaker 7>defining the derivative for mod X, then there isn't a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 7>limit at f of x equals zero for the mod

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 7>x part of the equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58]}

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 7>Equation?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.830
<v Speaker 7>No, but but like there is no limit at zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:07.910
<v Speaker 7>for the mod x part.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.070
<v Speaker 7>So you can't really define like a derivative at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.510
<v Speaker 0>Well let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.990
<v Speaker 0>What happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 0>Because I think the situation is a little bit more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.110
<v Speaker 0>complex than that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.870
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing that would help and I would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 0>I would recommend this is to plot the equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 0>If you plot the equation, you see that the equation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.450
<v Speaker 0>is continuous at zero, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at the graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.650
<v Speaker 0>So when I have when I have things like mod

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 0>and so on, I think it's helpful to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.770
<v Speaker 0>this as piecewise defined equations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:53.050
<v Speaker 0>So this is the equation and this is the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.290
<v Speaker 0>Now if I show you the now the first thing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 0>I want to say is that for what you see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:04.490
<v Speaker 0>on the board that derivative is continuous everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.410
<v Speaker 0>And we need to understand what happens at zero okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,97,100,100,90]}

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.970
<v Speaker 0>If I show you the plot of that equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.210
<v Speaker 0>This is the x mod x that's continuous at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.680
<v Speaker 0>So in principle it could have a derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 0>Now, if I go and calculate the limits from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.000
<v Speaker 0>left and the limit from the right of the derivative,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.920
<v Speaker 0>I found out that actually these are the same and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.640
<v Speaker 0>this is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 0>So this is defined everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 0>So the right answer is the answer number three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 0>So when you think about this thing it is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.880
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.600
<v Speaker 0>The mod X has does funny things around zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.360
<v Speaker 0>But that equation is not just mod x is x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.320
<v Speaker 0>times mod x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 0>And and doing yourself the graph of the equation helps

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 0>you understanding what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,97,100,100]}

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.320
<v Speaker 0>If that had had a massive discontinuity in zero, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 0>you could have said, okay, this is not what I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.200
<v Speaker 0>looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 0>But in fact, as you can see, it doesn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.840
<v Speaker 0>In fact, I think that will happen since zero changes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.680
<v Speaker 0>concavity, which is fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.520
<v Speaker 0>It's not a discontinuity, it's just how we call it.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.960

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 0>It's an f of g of x where the f

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 0>of x is the arcsine of the g of x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.500
<v Speaker 0>is the g of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,52,100,100]}

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:57.420
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.100
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40]}

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for your loss.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,31,31,30]}

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.280
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 0>Somebody pointed out to my slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,95]}

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.520
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody else see my type in my slides?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,42,88,100]}

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.160
<v Speaker 0>That should be d y d x, which I will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,55,58,61,68,100,100,100]}

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.480
<v Speaker 0>correct for next group.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.680
<v Speaker 0>That is coming after you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 0>So I think that I can show you the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.240
<v Speaker 0>This was very very uncontroversial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.080
<v Speaker 0>Because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.800
<v Speaker 0>I think everybody has understood that we are dealing with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.120
<v Speaker 0>what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.840
<v Speaker 0>Well what is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100]}

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.590
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.270
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to think about if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 0>want to take the derivative of that function?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Of course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.710
<v Speaker 0>And you want to tell me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,90,92,92,92]}

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:35.830
<v Speaker 6>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:37.870
<v Speaker 6>And so by using the chain rule, you have the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:42.110
<v Speaker 6>derivative of arc sine of e to the x, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 6>is one over root, one minus e to the two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 6>x multiplied by the derivative of e to the x,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.070
<v Speaker 6>which is just e to the x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.790
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 0>So this is the classic example of a time where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.190
<v Speaker 0>you need to remember the chain rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.950
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.670
<v Speaker 0>This is a composition of function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 0>You have f of g of x and f of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.190
<v Speaker 0>x is the arcsine function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.950
<v Speaker 0>And the g of x is the e to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:03.790
<v Speaker 0>x function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:08.030
<v Speaker 0>So if I wanted to just apply the um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:15.050
<v Speaker 0>The chain rule is the standard Chain rule application.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.330
<v Speaker 0>And so I have yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,97]}

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 0>You see I got it correct there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.330
<v Speaker 0>So I have, I have d dx of f of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,97,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 0>g of x is f dash of g f times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,97,100]}

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:27.970
<v Speaker 0>g dash.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:33.010
<v Speaker 0>This is pretty standard application of the chain rule okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 0>So I think we're done for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.370
<v Speaker 0>Do you have any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Anything you want to ask me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay so we finished three minutes earlier then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:48.430
<v Speaker 0>Guys, given that we're not going to be a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.430
<v Speaker 0>of people, can you come a bit closer so I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.910
<v Speaker 0>can see you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:55.990
<v Speaker 0>Because otherwise I need binoculars to see you up there.
