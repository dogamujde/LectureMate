00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 0>So today we will carry on talking about derivatives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 0>What we will do, we will see some applications of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 0>laws of derivatives and derivatives of special functions or logarithm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,60]}

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 0>and all this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 0>But we will also talk about implicit implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 0>Who can tell me what this is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 0>What is implicit differentiation and when do we use it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 0>Oh gosh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 0>You should come and sit at the front.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 0>That is all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,66,66,99]}

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 0>Tell us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,62]}

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92]}

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Implicit differentiation is, I think, implicit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,91,100]}

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Implicit differentiation is when, um, we do differentiation involving a,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 2>um, implicit function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 2>For example, for example, if you have, um, say, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the equation of a circle like x squared plus y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>squared equals some constant, um, well you could um, do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 2>it normally.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Um, you could um, apply the differentiation to both x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 2>and y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Um, except um with.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100]}

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 2>While differentiating the y, you multiply it by dy over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,75,100]}

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 2>dx.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 0>So that's exactly it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 0>And that's exactly the example I have in the slides

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 0>now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 0>So the idea of implicit differentiation is something that allows

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 0>us to differentiate functions where I cannot separate the variables.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 0>So the example of the circle is really an interesting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 0>example because there's a quite simple process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,60,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 0>And it can show you, as we will see in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 0>a minute, how by carrying out the implicit differentiation and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 0>kind of changing the shape of the equation and carrying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 0>out normal differentiation, we get to the same result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 0>So what are we going to do today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing we'll think about we'll think a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,66,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 0>little bit more about rules around the products of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 0>How do I differentiate the product of function of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79,88,100]}

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 0>quotient?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 0>I don't have it up there, but I'm sure it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 0>in the book or the composition of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 0>I think we saw already one exercise last week, nor

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,47]}

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 0>last week on Monday about composition of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 0>So we'll just go and do a little bit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.830
<v Speaker 0>those as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.990
<v Speaker 0>But as I was saying, I want to talk a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.270
<v Speaker 0>moment about implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 0>And I want to go through the example that just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.030
<v Speaker 0>by chance, I assure you this is a coincidence that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 0>your colleague mentioned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 0>So suppose I have a circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.030
<v Speaker 0>Suppose I want to calculate the slope of the tangent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 0>to that circle at some point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing I need to think about is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 0>that if I want to do this with normal procedures,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 0>like the things we have seen up to Monday, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 0>is not a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 0>So I need to do something to it, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.910
<v Speaker 0>It's not a function, you remember?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 0>Because if I apply the vertical test, the vertical test

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 0>fails a vertical line that cuts the circle cuts the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 0>circle in two points, which tells me immediately that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,98]}

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 0>not a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 0>However, I can consider some sections of this shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 0>So for example, I can consider the upper the upper

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 0>circle by writing this function in the shape y equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 0>something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 0>And that is a perfectly good function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.530
<v Speaker 0>So if you apply the vertical test to this section

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,78,100]}

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.010
<v Speaker 0>of the circle we are all happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 0>So suppose I want to calculate the tangent line to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 0>one to a point in that section.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.650
<v Speaker 0>I can just write the equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 0>Is explicit form and this will become y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.210
<v Speaker 0>If I want to just consider the top semicircle, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 0>will become y equal one minus x squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 0>And then I can calculate the derivative in a standard

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 0>way as I calculate the derivative of questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 0>So that's that's absolutely fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 0>In fact that derivative is I can consider it like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 0>a composition of functions, right where I have the A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,51]}

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 0>quotient, and at the bottom I have a square root.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Speaker 0>So I need to think about the derivative of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 0>square root.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.230
<v Speaker 0>But inside the square root I have another function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 0>So I need to apply the formula for the composition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 0>of function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,89]}

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.790
<v Speaker 0>And if you do all the calculations which I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 0>want to do for this one, you get the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 0>If you don't believe me, do the calculations and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 0>tell me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 0>So this is the standard way that we know how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.270
<v Speaker 0>to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>What we were saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 0>Before is okay, I don't want to do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 0>I want to carry on with this idea of differentiating

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.350
<v Speaker 0>implicitly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 0>And so basically what we do, we consider the differentiation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 0>of x and y in a way together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 0>So if I have the equation of a circle my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.390
<v Speaker 0>circle was I think x squared plus y squared equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 0>to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.630
<v Speaker 0>I apply the rule of the of implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,88,47,100,100,100]}

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 0>session.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37]}

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.220
<v Speaker 0>And this is the process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 0>This is around page 310 in your book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 0>I think there is a chapter dedicated to implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.060
<v Speaker 0>And when I go to calculate the debt expression at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.140
<v Speaker 0>the point where I wanted to calculate the the slope

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,58,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.980
<v Speaker 0>of the tangent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 0>Thankfully I obtained the same result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,100,100,99]}

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 0>Now obviously in a case like this, it is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 0>convenient to use implicit differentiation because it's much easier to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.660
<v Speaker 0>rearrange the function and consider just the part of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 0>function where I want it to go and calculate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,97,90,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 0>derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.180
<v Speaker 0>But there are a lot of cases in which this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 0>is not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 0>So where the algebraic expression is quite complex and it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Speaker 0>is not possible to go and rearrange it in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 0>way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 0>Y equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100]}

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 0>And these are the cases where implicit differentiation comes in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.260
<v Speaker 0>So this is like the topic for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 0>Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.400
<v Speaker 0>Oh I don't know what's going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 0>Let's see some exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Speaker 0>So I'll put this up and I'll bring it up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.320

<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.960
<v Speaker 0>So if you log in, I think it worked really

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 0>quite well on Monday.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 0>I'll switch the book club off, and I'll give you

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 0>a little bit of time to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.640

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 0>People are still logging in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>There you are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.040
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'll give you three minutes, because this should be

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 0>really pretty straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll have we'll have a look at it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,86,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Another question.

<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.390
<v Speaker 0>So I need a few more boats.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81]}

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.870
<v Speaker 0>Not even a fourth of the people logged in and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.310
<v Speaker 0>put it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100]}

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[24]}

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay, this should be pretty straightforward, so I'm quite happy

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 0>to to have to have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 0>So this is the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.430
<v Speaker 0>The consensus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.670
<v Speaker 0>And I think I'm I am happy to go with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.030
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.630
<v Speaker 0>Somebody can explain to me why that's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 0>So maybe I should qualify somebody in the bottom section

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.130
<v Speaker 0>of the lecture theatre.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97]}

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.690
<v Speaker 0>Can you explain to me why this is true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 0>So what do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.210
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:26.890
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 0>I mean, the reason for this is straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.410
<v Speaker 0>That is the definition of the derivative of that function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 0>at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.730
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.050
<v Speaker 0>If you remember we calculate the derivatives with limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,88,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 0>And the limit is on the size of the increment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 0>of the x of the x right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.610
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.110
<v Speaker 0>This is my definition of derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 0>I've just changed the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,99,100]}

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.870
<v Speaker 0>The unknown x with the with the value three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 0>And I've calculated the limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 0>So that is exactly the definition of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.990
<v Speaker 0>Let's go and have a look at next one.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 0>You have the text on the slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 3>You need to understand that once you understand something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay, I'll give you two more minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>So now we see what?

<v Speaker 0>What this is.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.610
<v Speaker 0>So I think that we are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.730
<v Speaker 0>So that's excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.930
<v Speaker 0>This exercise is interesting in some way because this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.130
<v Speaker 0>a typical example of a function that it is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 0>possible to, to take in the form of y equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:04.410
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.050
<v Speaker 0>So for the circle we say that with a simple

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,89,100]}

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 0>operation we could separate the two arms of the circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.530
<v Speaker 0>If you write.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.690
<v Speaker 0>In fact we could have done different things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.090
<v Speaker 0>I could have also just considered one quarter of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 0>circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.010
<v Speaker 0>That would have also been possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.970
<v Speaker 0>But with this function, this is not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 0>I cannot bring this in the form of y equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.770
<v Speaker 0>and so on into to use implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,71,27,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.610
<v Speaker 0>The result is indeed the first, and this is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 0>way that we find it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100]}

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.330
<v Speaker 0>So if you look at this, at this calculation, so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 0>the the number, the question, the reply number three was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 0>only to bring your attention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 0>And when we look at this calculation, we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,100,100,99,100,97,97,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 0>be careful with taking accounts, all the signs and everything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86,79,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.070
<v Speaker 0>The number three is just the correct solution with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:53.750
<v Speaker 0>wrong sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 0>So the process in which we do this is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 0>usual process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.270
<v Speaker 0>It's the same process that we have seen for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 0>equation of the circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.790
<v Speaker 0>This was also quite um yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,55,98]}

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.750
<v Speaker 0>And there is a typo.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.670
<v Speaker 0>It's also quite straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100]}

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.390
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 0>So we we carry on the process and we obtain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:18.630
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 0>The only thing which is I mean, if I remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 0>myself as a student when I was doing this stuff,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.270
<v Speaker 0>the only thing that I found difficult about implicit differentiation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 0>is that the calculations were a bit fiddly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.270
<v Speaker 0>That's what I remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 0>So the idea is not quite very difficult, but to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.950
<v Speaker 0>be able to calculate, to carry on the calculations properly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.710
<v Speaker 0>is a bit fiddly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.430
<v Speaker 0>So my advice would be to do a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.230
<v Speaker 0>exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.290
<v Speaker 0>Okay, do a lot of the stock quizzes and do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,93,100,100,100]}

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 0>a lot of the exercises from the book, because that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.850
<v Speaker 0>will give you some dexterity with doing these kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,95,100]}

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.770
<v Speaker 0>calculations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.490
<v Speaker 0>Now, of course, I have the d dx and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,75,68,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.810
<v Speaker 0>could have just oh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.890
<v Speaker 0>No this were not the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,80,100,100,100]}

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 0>Sorry they were switched.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.490
<v Speaker 0>Sorry I was misreading.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 0>I couldn't quite read the third function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 0>This plain book club is not quite clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.050
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now the only thing I wanted to say is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:16.130
<v Speaker 0>that this d dx, which I found is itself a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.210
<v Speaker 0>function, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 0>I could in principle calculate the derivative that would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 0>the second derivative of the of the function which I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.410
<v Speaker 0>originally had, and I would do this applying implicit differentiation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 0>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.450
<v Speaker 0>My thinking is that as we go out up with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 0>the degrees of differentiation, this becomes more and more difficult

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.410
<v Speaker 0>because the algebraic expression becomes more and more difficult.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.670
<v Speaker 0>but I think it's really important to to keep in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 0>mind that although we have obtained this dy dx by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,31,62,100]}

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 0>applying a procedure, we are going in and with uncertain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,98,100,80,100,100]}

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.790
<v Speaker 0>algebraic movements, if you like, that has given you that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100,69,95,82,100]}

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.270
<v Speaker 0>that is an object in itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 0>And this is something that is really important to remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 0>Let's see next exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.450
<v Speaker 0>So I am going to give you 5 or 6

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.470
<v Speaker 0>minutes to do this because this is quite.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.910
<v Speaker 0>So this is a bit fiddly okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.060
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,34,26,26,26]}

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 3>1900.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[26]}

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 3>This is like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,89]}

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.120
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35,25,39]}

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54]}

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.530
<v Speaker 0>So I can see more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,99]}

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.570
<v Speaker 0>There are people still writing, so I'll give you another

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 0>minute or so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100]}

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63]}

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:09.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:09.930
<v Speaker 0>Shall we take a look?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 0>So that is indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100]}

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.410
<v Speaker 0>See the correct result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.250
<v Speaker 0>Now this exercise is interesting because it's one of these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.210
<v Speaker 0>exercises that we really cannot do in the form in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.290
<v Speaker 0>which we are given it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100]}

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.770
<v Speaker 0>So somebody who voted see tells me what are what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,39,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 0>is the first thing that they did.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.150
<v Speaker 0>it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Well, the problem is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 4>The log that's in the power.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,42,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.110
<v Speaker 4>So if you take the natural log of both sides,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.030
<v Speaker 4>then using log laws, you can, uh, bring the sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,67]}

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.950
<v Speaker 4>of power down as a coefficient at the front, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,95,87,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.230
<v Speaker 4>then it's much easier to implicitly differentiate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.110
<v Speaker 0>So I have a logarithm of the exponents and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,100,83,52,100]}

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 0>exponents that I have no idea what to do with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.470
<v Speaker 0>this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 0>Like really, I have no idea what to do with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.910
<v Speaker 0>this, and I need to remember what the rules of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,69,100,100]}

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.750
<v Speaker 0>the logarithms of what movements do I know that allow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.070
<v Speaker 0>me to make this a bit more accessible?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 0>And as your colleague said, exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 0>That's what we need to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:16.750
<v Speaker 0>We take logs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 0>And then now we have taken logs, and now this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.550
<v Speaker 0>looks already a lot more possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:27.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:33.780
<v Speaker 0>Now, just as an aside, we do all these operations,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 0>algebraic operations, these functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100]}

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.860
<v Speaker 0>In principle, we should check that it is possible to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 0>do this operation and where it is possible to do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.380
<v Speaker 0>these operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:41.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.180
<v Speaker 0>So we have constraints on the X and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 0>For now we just don't do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.940
<v Speaker 0>We concentrate on the technique of solving this exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.780
<v Speaker 0>But remember that these are all functions which are domain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.740
<v Speaker 0>and have range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.380
<v Speaker 0>And so that would be in principle interesting to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.500
<v Speaker 0>So now we have taken logs are much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 0>I am a much happier person.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 0>So what is the next thing that I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.540
<v Speaker 0>think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.900
<v Speaker 0>So what is the next?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 0>The next action.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.660
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to say here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,79]}

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 0>Do you want to say it in the market?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,70]}

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 0>Those people can't hear here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,99,99,100]}

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 3>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:34.720
<v Speaker 0>Know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.680
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.400
<v Speaker 0>So the next thing I need to do is to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.600
<v Speaker 0>think about what are the laws of the logarithms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 0>Now, I know that there are lots of laws that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100,100,100]}

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.560
<v Speaker 0>regulate how logarithms multiply, divide and add and so on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,99,64,90,100,100,100]}

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.000
<v Speaker 0>and so forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.800
<v Speaker 0>We've seen some of them, I think, on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.520
<v Speaker 0>So now I have that expression and I apply the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.800
<v Speaker 0>laws of the logarithms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100]}

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.840
<v Speaker 0>And if I apply the laws of the logarithms I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.200
<v Speaker 0>get that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 0>And then I differentiate as you see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,42,99,99]}

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.480
<v Speaker 0>So the the thing that was interesting in this exercise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.960
<v Speaker 0>is this idea that once we have a function which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.040
<v Speaker 0>we don't immediately think, oh yes, I can apply this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 0>rule or I can do that, we need to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.280
<v Speaker 0>about what do I know that I can do in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 0>order to make this function, so that I can calculate,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 0>in this case the implicit differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 0>And then from there I can just get on with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.300
<v Speaker 0>Then I multiplied by y and I find that okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,72,100,98,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 0>Now, this is not going to be always obvious.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.700
<v Speaker 0>And as I said before regarding implicit differentiation, these exercises

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96]}

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 0>are not conceptually difficult if you like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.140
<v Speaker 0>They are a bit fiddly, so I would really advise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.100
<v Speaker 0>to do quite a bit of them so you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 0>learn in situations like when I have a logarithm of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,71]}

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.380
<v Speaker 0>the exponent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 0>What do I do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.060
<v Speaker 0>I take logs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.340
<v Speaker 0>So if you do a lot of them then you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.860
<v Speaker 0>will see that you will apply techniques.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,71]}

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 0>You will acquire techniques that will allow you to solve

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.660
<v Speaker 0>these exercises quite quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 0>And I think it is important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.540
<v Speaker 0>So if you remember Chris in his first lecture when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.980
<v Speaker 0>he was talking about these kind of procedures, yes, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,93,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.860
<v Speaker 0>can stick this in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100]}

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.460
<v Speaker 0>Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Alpha can do it for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,88,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.980
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't take a minute, but it's important to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 0>able to to carry out this procedure because it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.250
<v Speaker 0>important to be able to check them and see whether

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.730
<v Speaker 0>the results I obtain is a result, which is plausible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,80,95,100,95,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 0>This is important for mathematics and is important for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 0>lot of other disciplines, for example statistics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.250
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:44.810
<v Speaker 0>Next one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 0>What do we do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:48.210
<v Speaker 3>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[20]}

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[20]}

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 0>You're both in too quickly for me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.450
<v Speaker 0>Give me a break.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97]}

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.530
<v Speaker 0>So there we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.450
<v Speaker 0>So I am delighted about the result of this vote

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.610
<v Speaker 0>because we talked about this on Monday.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.890
<v Speaker 0>Who can give me an example of a function that

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.830

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:28.710
<v Speaker 0>is not continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.750
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to ask you to shout.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 0>It's not going to work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:49.870
<v Speaker 0>What is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

<v Speaker 2>Modulus of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.950
<v Speaker 0>We saw this last.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85]}

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.910
<v Speaker 0>We saw this on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.310
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 0>Do you remember on Monday we were talking about the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.510
<v Speaker 0>function mod X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,61,100]}

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:01.110
<v Speaker 0>And we were discussing the fact that being continuous is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 0>a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition even to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.350

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 0>So let alone having a continuous derivative, in fact, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,80]}

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 0>exactly the example that I have here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.710
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody think of any other example?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.790
<v Speaker 0>Square root of x y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93]}

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.430
<v Speaker 3>The derivative will be vulnerable to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.430
<v Speaker 5>Square root of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 5>And x can take value zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.110
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.020
<v Speaker 0>So if you do the derivative of square root of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.420
<v Speaker 0>x, what happens to the function that you obtain as

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.940
<v Speaker 0>a derivative is not a continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 0>It's not a function which is continuous everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 0>But my go to example is always this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 0>Well the x okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,94,100,100]}

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.100
<v Speaker 0>So it's really interesting because when you were solving this

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.139

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.899
<v Speaker 0>Like here, a function must be continuous to have a

<v Speaker 3>Think it's.

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.990
<v Speaker 0>Should we have a look?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.870
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.030
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.990
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 0>So the solution is, uh, number two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.070
<v Speaker 0>What is interesting about this, um, this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,47,100,100]}

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.030
<v Speaker 0>So what is g dash of zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.950
<v Speaker 0>What mathematical object is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.230
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to know anything else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.350
<v Speaker 4>What's the rate of change of the function g at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.190
<v Speaker 4>x equals zero?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.500
<v Speaker 0>Yes, but what mathematical object is Say it's number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,55,100,100,100,73,48,98]}

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:22.620
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.780
<v Speaker 0>So this is interesting because sometimes some students may be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100]}

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.780
<v Speaker 0>thrown out by the fact that they cannot actually calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.420
<v Speaker 0>g of zero because we don't know who g of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:33.900
<v Speaker 0>x is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.900
<v Speaker 0>But the only thing you need to know about this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.340
<v Speaker 0>is that there is a number, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.260
<v Speaker 0>So whatever number we are not interested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.580
<v Speaker 0>So if I then get into the idea that g

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 0>g dash of zero and zero zero numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,56,99,100]}

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.060
<v Speaker 0>So I treat them like numbers, then this exercise becomes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 0>quite easy because all what I need to do, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.700
<v Speaker 0>need to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 0>I only have a product to differentiate there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.140
<v Speaker 0>I have x g of sine of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52,52,100,100]}

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 0>So I have a product and a composition function, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,84,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.620
<v Speaker 0>can be the only one that is a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.420
<v Speaker 0>difficult, but I just go in with the rules of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.060
<v Speaker 0>differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 0>I can differentiate that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:17.580
<v Speaker 0>And so I find that that's the derivative of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.880
<v Speaker 0>If you do the product and then you do the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.280
<v Speaker 0>composition of function, because sine of g of x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,99,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.560
<v Speaker 0>a composition of function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.720
<v Speaker 0>And then you find that and then you calculate that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.280
<v Speaker 0>at zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100]}

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.160
<v Speaker 0>Of course when you calculate that at zero, anything that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 0>trigonometric function that goes zero and zero disappears.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.640
<v Speaker 0>And you and you find the second solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.800
<v Speaker 0>So when you have exercises of this sort, don't get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 0>confused by the fact that you don't know what the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,95]}

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.720
<v Speaker 0>function g is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.720
<v Speaker 0>So you cannot calculate g of g in this case

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,71,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 0>g dash of zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100]}

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.880
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.800
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't really matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.160
<v Speaker 0>It's a number and all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,77,100,98,100]}

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.640
<v Speaker 0>What matters in solving exercises like this is that that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.280
<v Speaker 0>is a number and a treated like a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,61,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.320
<v Speaker 0>And that's how I write it is minus sine of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,87,98]}

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 0>g of zero, whatever number that may be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,98,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.080
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 0>Let's do the oh gosh okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 0>Let's do the last one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.060
<v Speaker 3>All right.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.750
<v Speaker 0>This is amazing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:42.430
<v Speaker 0>Honestly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 0>What is this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 0>What have you done?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,90,100]}

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.030
<v Speaker 0>Somebody.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.630
<v Speaker 0>Chain rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 0>This is all what there is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:56.350
<v Speaker 0>You have that function that, um, where you need to,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,67,91,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 0>um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.710
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.990
<v Speaker 0>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 0>You need to apply the the chain rule because you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.990
<v Speaker 0>have the g of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.030
<v Speaker 0>If I have g of f of x, g of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 0>x in this case would be um, the square root

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100]}

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.430
<v Speaker 0>of x and f of x would be x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,97]}

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 0>So if I think about applying the chain rule, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.570
<v Speaker 0>this is what I would find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:20.690
<v Speaker 0>Pretty straightforward.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.570
<v Speaker 0>So in conclusion for this lecture today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.130

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 0>little bit more conceptual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.970
<v Speaker 0>Regarding the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 0>So things like when the derivative exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 0>And so on and so forth.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 0>We have talked about limits and how to calculate it.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.970
<v Speaker 0>how to solve these exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100]}

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:48.650
<v Speaker 0>These are pretty straightforward exercises once you know what you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100]}

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.410
<v Speaker 0>And there are a few things that you need to

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 0>keep in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.450
<v Speaker 0>You need to keep in mind the rules of the

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.330
<v Speaker 0>logarithms you need to keep in mind.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 0>The rules of differentiation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.370
<v Speaker 0>Both differentiation of known functions like logarithms.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:01.450
<v Speaker 0>Square roots, and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 0>But also the rules of composition and product of functions.
