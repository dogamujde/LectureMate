00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 0>Hello.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 0>I think it's time to start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for coming to the second lecture for cap.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 0>So just before I start, just one admin thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 0>If you need to have a change of group for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 0>your workshops on the Tuesday, don't email myself, Chris or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,99,100,100,100,99]}

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 0>Lily because this is not something we do and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 0>don't have the list.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 0>Please email the course secretary whose name you will find

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 0>on the login page, and she will and she will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,31,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 0>help you out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 0>So do it quite quickly because if your clashes then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 0>you can't come to the workshops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 0>And actually I think it's really beneficial that you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 0>So as I said in the lecture on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 0>Yeah Monday we carry on talking a little bit about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 0>function and graphs today or actually not talking so much,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 0>but more kind of looking at exercises.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully you have read the chapter of the book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 0>The parts of the first chapter of the book that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 0>you had to read for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 0>But we will also see something about Trig expressions and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 0>we'll see something about logarithms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,96,100,100,100]}

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 0>So it's a little bit like a mixed bag today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 0>Before we start, I just wanted to talk about domain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 0>and range for one more minute, because I noticed in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 0>the workshop when I was tutoring on on Tuesday, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 0>there was a little bit of confusion regarding this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing I want to say is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 0>we don't really have a standard way to calculate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 0>domain of a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 0>So there is no a procedure that you can apply,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 0>When we want to calculate the domain of the function,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 0>the only thing that we can do is to look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 0>at the function and try to understand when this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,93,100,99,100,100]}

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 0>not defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 0>And that's really the only thing that we can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 0>that is not like I do this and then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 0>do that and then I apply that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.210
<v Speaker 0>There are very straightforward cases that we know when it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,80]}

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 0>is square root.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100]}

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 0>We need to worry about whether what's under the square

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,96,100,100,100]}

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.650
<v Speaker 0>root is positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 0>When you have a denominator, you need to worry about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 0>the denominator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 0>If you have a step function, then you need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 0>worry a little bit about how the step function defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 0>In the example that I have up on the board.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 0>Obviously this thing is only defined between minus infinity and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 0>seven and ten and plus infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 0>So that would be the range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.810
<v Speaker 0>But I could have had a more complicated function in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 0>the definition of each one of the steps.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 0>And if that had been the case then you would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 0>have to worry also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 0>When is that defined?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so for a ray, this is why I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,76,41,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 0>it's really a good idea to try to acquire some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 0>familiarity and understanding what the functions I'm dealing with look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 0>like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 0>So what type of function this is?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 0>How do these families of function behave for the range?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 0>We have a little bit more of a procedure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.630
<v Speaker 0>So the range we calculate by looking at where.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.430
<v Speaker 0>In a way where in the domain of the function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,97,92,100,100,100,75,100,100]}

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.670
<v Speaker 0>I can find a y, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.110
<v Speaker 0>The way in which we think about is, at least

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,51,51]}

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 0>the way I think about it, is that if my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 0>function is given by y equal f of x, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 0>is usually what we have, then I want to find

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.630
<v Speaker 0>where there exists an x from which a y comes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 0>So I want to revert if you like my process.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.870
<v Speaker 0>Instead of having something y equals f of x, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,43,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 0>want to have something x equal g of y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.550
<v Speaker 0>And we know how to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 0>A kind of fairly simple algebraic manipulation which consists in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 0>taking out the term x, and the place where that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 0>g of is defined would be the range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.070
<v Speaker 0>Now think about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.350
<v Speaker 0>If you think about the most simple quadratic function that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 0>we know, which is the parabola.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 0>Um, talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,97]}

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 0>So if you think about this function, this is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 0>Y equals x squared okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,80]}

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.650
<v Speaker 0>What is the domain of this function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 0>I've given all the real numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[25,25,98,100,100,100]}

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 0>Do we agree that the domain of this function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 0>all the real numbers?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 0>There's no reason why I could not stick any real

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 0>number in that function and get something out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 0>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.930
<v Speaker 0>What is the range?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 0>And.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 0>Aha.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.290
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>X squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 0>Negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 0>So when I apply that way of thinking, I want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 0>to reverse this in something that looks like x equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 0>And so this will be plus or minus square root

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 0>of y.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 0>And this is obviously undefined when y is positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 0>So you can see that the range is not the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.310
<v Speaker 0>domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 0>And this process is quite easy with an easy function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 0>like this is a marginally more laborious for a, not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,83,100,100,100,100,81,66]}

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 0>for a more laborious function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100]}

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 0>But it is possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 0>And this is the way we do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 0>So it's a little bit of a more kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 0>organised approach to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100]}

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.950
<v Speaker 0>So before too long let's start.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 0>With our first question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 0>So we have seen in the worksheet on Tuesday that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 0>we are starting playing with trigonometric trigonometric relationships.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,72,100,100,100,91,100,68]}

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 0>So this is my question today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 0>For now I will give you three minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 0>Maybe if I find my watch.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.590
<v Speaker 0>Have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.340
<v Speaker 0>If you can't quite see on the green of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 0>blue club.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,85]}

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.860
<v Speaker 0>This is reproduced in the slide, is the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,94,99,100]}

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.120
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90,92]}

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Unknown>Oh, no!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,50]}

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Unknown>Oh!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39]}

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.500
<v Speaker 2>No!

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:06.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 0>So we take a look at this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.410
<v Speaker 0>So I think again we have quite a clear winner,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 0>which is indeed the correct solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.730
<v Speaker 0>Does anybody know that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,34,82]}

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 0>So is there anybody that wants to tell me what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.250
<v Speaker 0>they used to find?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.730
<v Speaker 0>The second solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.050
<v Speaker 0>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.610
<v Speaker 0>Equality.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.130
<v Speaker 0>What trigonometric relationship did you use?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 0>Anybody wants to volunteer?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.290
<v Unknown>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Unknown>Cos that is equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[26,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Minus sine squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.570
<v Speaker 0>Absolutely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 0>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 0>So my rule of thumb with trigonometric expressions is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.010
<v Speaker 0>when I need to change something, if in doubt try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 0>to use sine squared x plus cos square x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.070
<v Speaker 0>equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 0>Because that usually takes us a long way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't take us all the way in a lot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 0>of the cases, but it takes us a long way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 0>So how do I go around thinking about the, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.670
<v Speaker 0>how to solve this problem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 0>Because to try to do the manipulations is not quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.310
<v Speaker 0>enough, because you have you are giving me the, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,86,57,100,100,92]}

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.870
<v Speaker 0>like the relationship in terms to cos.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.750
<v Speaker 0>And of course, because it's a square, there is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,82,100,100]}

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.950
<v Speaker 0>plus or minus before it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 0>And so we need to know which, which part we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.870
<v Speaker 0>need to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 0>And in order to do this we need to see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 0>where sine and cosine when the sine minus one is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.430
<v Speaker 0>defined and what is positive and what is negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 0>So these are the two things we need to use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 0>Obviously tan x is sine x over cos x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,70,100,100,94,100,100,87,100]}

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 0>And that's the other relationship that you mentioned.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.430
<v Speaker 0>This was the very straightforward thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 0>I have an expression in tan.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 0>So I try to take it in sine and cosine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 0>So then I need to think a little bit about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 0>okay, I want to use that course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,62]}

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 0>Do I need to take the positive part or do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 0>I need to take the negative part?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.450
<v Speaker 0>In order to do this, I need to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.450
<v Speaker 0>sign minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100]}

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 0>Can you see that picture?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,99]}

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 0>Maybe so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.050
<v Speaker 0>Sign minus one is defined in minus pi over two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,44,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.890
<v Speaker 0>Pi over two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 0>Forex between -1 and 1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.130
<v Speaker 0>And the is positive for x in minus pi two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 0>over two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.610
<v Speaker 0>So we need to take the positive part right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 0>So we can't just decide that we need to kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,71]}

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 0>of have a little bit of a think about where

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.850
<v Speaker 0>this sign minus x, that sign minus one x that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 0>I want to to talk about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 0>And then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 0>We can write that expression for cosine minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,28,60,100]}

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 0>And we then put it in my original expression and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.970
<v Speaker 0>we obtain the solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 0>So my um the thing that you want to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 0>about when you do exercises of this type is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 0>the moment you use the sine squared x plus cos

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.990
<v Speaker 0>square x is equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.990
<v Speaker 0>Unless you use it using the square, the square of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.790
<v Speaker 0>the Trig function, which is fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.270
<v Speaker 0>Sometimes we will use it that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 0>You need to think about sine okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.310
<v Speaker 0>And you need to reason about the function that you're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.870
<v Speaker 0>looking at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.630
<v Speaker 0>So in this case this is what um the solution

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,100,100]}

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 0>that we obtain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73]}

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.430
<v Speaker 0>So B is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 0>So excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91]}

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.630
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.110
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to ask all the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.230
<v Speaker 0>So if you have a question just ask.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.510
<v Speaker 0>Just take your hands up and ask okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.150
<v Speaker 0>What do we want to do next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 0>So this is a okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100]}

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 0>That was quick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Come.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57]}

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.600
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 0>I think we can stop here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.360
<v Speaker 0>I think that there is an overwhelming answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 0>So anybody that wants to tell me how they found

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.360
<v Speaker 0>out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.960
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.240
<v Speaker 0>Um, which is also to say that if you compose

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 0>the two functions from the right and then from the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.440
<v Speaker 0>left, you need to obtain the same function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.920
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 0>Generally, when we have inverse of a function type exercises

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.800
<v Speaker 0>of this sort, we do the composition on one way,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100]}

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.120
<v Speaker 0>the composition on the other way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.000
<v Speaker 0>If I get, because we have seen last week that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 0>the composition of function is not commutative like the product

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 0>of real numbers, for example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.540
<v Speaker 0>So if I get the same results, then they are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,80]}

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.100
<v Speaker 0>one, the inverse of the other and the working out

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.620
<v Speaker 0>is here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.140
<v Speaker 0>In fact, again, if you just wanted to sketch the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.900
<v Speaker 0>two functions, you could have seen this from the graph

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.380
<v Speaker 0>as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 0>This is why I said it's really important to try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 0>to have an idea of how functions work, and how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.180
<v Speaker 0>I can sketch them on the real numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.780
<v Speaker 0>There were quite a bit of exercises on the worksheet

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.740
<v Speaker 0>for the week about sketching graphs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.940
<v Speaker 0>At the moment we are doing it with a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 0>bit of intuition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.980
<v Speaker 0>Later on in the course we will talk about limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.260
<v Speaker 0>We will talk about asymptotes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 0>We will talk about derivatives which allow us to to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.700
<v Speaker 0>find maximum, minimum and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.780
<v Speaker 0>But for now we just use a little bit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.700
<v Speaker 0>intuition in our work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 0>In this case it was very easy because I have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.660
<v Speaker 0>two straight lines so I can plot those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 0>And if you do the composition you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 0>You get that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 0>The other thing that you should have checked, and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.810
<v Speaker 0>just assume that you know this because, you know, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 0>stuff is that the functions have inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,77,100]}

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.810
<v Speaker 0>We have also seen, I think, last week, the not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.050
<v Speaker 0>all functions of an inverse.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.290
<v Speaker 0>In this case they do write linear functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,64,100,52,100,100]}

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 0>They do so before we just this is just to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.930
<v Speaker 0>say that before we go into the like straightforward algebraic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.250
<v Speaker 0>manipulation, we really need to think a little bit about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.010
<v Speaker 0>what you are doing, the functions you are dealing with,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.250
<v Speaker 0>and whether certain things exist and whether I can do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 0>certain things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this was easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.570
<v Speaker 0>Let's see another one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100]}

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:42.530
<v Unknown>Oh, my.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.610
<v Speaker 0>Wow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.170
<v Speaker 0>That's excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100]}

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 0>100% response.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Can somebody who bought it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,66,66]}

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.410
<v Speaker 0>Tell me what they did?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.890
<v Speaker 0>How did you find the solution?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,50]}

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>By the inverse function of log base two log logarithmic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,90]}

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.290
<v Speaker 1>functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48]}

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.970
<v Speaker 2>1 to 1.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And then apply the inverse constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,61,100,100,83]}

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.130
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.010
<v Speaker 0>This is complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 0>Can you say it in here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.110
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 1>So because.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,89]}

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Because log base two is a 1 to 1 function,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.750
<v Speaker 1>uh, you can apply the inverse, um, raise two to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100]}

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>the power of both sides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Um, and then similarly you can apply the inverse to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the function x plus four because that's 1 to 1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.190
<v Speaker 1>by subtracting four from both sides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And that gives you x equals four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.030
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.550
<v Speaker 0>So this is one way of doing another way of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.110
<v Speaker 0>doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.270
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42]}

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.190
<v Speaker 0>By the way one more way of doing this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 0>What could we have done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.350
<v Speaker 0>I think I can think at least one more way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.550
<v Speaker 0>Later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.270
<v Speaker 0>Who wants to tell me another way of doing of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 0>doing this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.710
<v Speaker 0>No, because it's the two functions, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,51,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.180
<v Speaker 0>So we could sketch the log function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,99,100]}

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:41.740
<v Speaker 0>The function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.460
<v Speaker 0>The constant function equal to three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.460
<v Speaker 0>Where these two functions intersect is the answer to our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 0>questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 0>So if I wanted to recap what am I doing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 0>So we can do exactly what your colleague said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Speaker 0>So we can use logarithm properties and just unpack this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.260
<v Speaker 0>function in this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.340
<v Speaker 0>Or we can draw the graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 0>I mean we can draw the log graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.980
<v Speaker 0>I think it's fairly easy to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.140
<v Speaker 0>X equal three is a straight line parallel to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 0>x axis that cuts the y axis at the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.180
<v Speaker 0>three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.540
<v Speaker 0>And where this intersect is the solution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 0>This is something which is important to remember, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.540
<v Speaker 0>When we talk about solution of equation we have this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.380
<v Speaker 0>equation equal to this other equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.540
<v Speaker 0>We have a lot of algebraic ways of of dealing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 0>with this by taking stuff from one side or applying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 0>logarithm or whatever.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,98,100]}

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.000
<v Speaker 0>But what that means is that you are looking for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100]}

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.600
<v Speaker 0>the points of intersections of these two curves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 0>And this is something which is useful to remember because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 0>when you don't really quite know what to do, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 0>maybe you can sketch a graph, and then you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.680
<v Speaker 0>get an idea of how to go around with things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 0>In this case, it was really pretty, pretty easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.360
<v Speaker 0>As I said, the log function is really not very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.400
<v Speaker 0>difficult to to sketch, and that's just a constant function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.880
<v Speaker 0>Let's see whether I can give you a more difficult

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.240
<v Speaker 0>one.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Unknown>For you to.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.250
<v Unknown>Hi.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Unknown>I'm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.150
<v Unknown>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.270
<v Speaker 0>So what do I need to know in order to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.310
<v Speaker 0>be able to solve questions of this type?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.910
<v Speaker 0>So what do I what are the things I use?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,60,36,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.350
<v Speaker 0>What do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:24.910
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.430
<v Speaker 0>I need to remember the log rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.270
<v Speaker 0>This is really the only thing I need to know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,73,61,100,100]}

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 0>So I need to remember the sum, the products, the

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.510

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.250
<v Speaker 0>In this case, what is the other slightly tricky issue

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:38.650
<v Speaker 0>here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.250
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44]}

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 0>There's a change of base because the two logarithm on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.570
<v Speaker 0>the right hand side are natural logarithm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 0>This means a logarithm to the base e, whilst the

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.690
<v Speaker 0>other logarithm is in base seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.450
<v Speaker 0>How many of you remembered all the log rules before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 0>they read the book for today?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.490
<v Speaker 0>Show of hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.010
<v Speaker 0>Well that's interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm not going to put my hand up because I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 0>did not remember them, but it's something that actually is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.130
<v Speaker 0>really kind of very useful to have when we do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 0>exercise of this sort.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,62,100]}

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.810
<v Speaker 0>So I know that it's a bit boring to try

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 0>to remember this formula, but we need them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.790
<v Speaker 0>So go in the book and look at the map.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.670
<v Speaker 0>Or we can look at them here as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.590
<v Speaker 0>So how do I solve that problem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.110
<v Speaker 0>I need to remember how to do the change of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.510
<v Speaker 0>base.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.630
<v Speaker 0>So the first thing that I need to think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:53.270
<v Speaker 0>is that before I can calculate anything like this, everything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.510
<v Speaker 0>needs to be in the same base.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.310
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm trying to do there, I'm trying to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100]}

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.910
<v Speaker 0>bring anything to the base E and then I can,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.390
<v Speaker 0>um, I can solve my, my problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 0>What are the formula for the logarithm that we really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.670
<v Speaker 0>want to remember?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.350
<v Speaker 0>I have put them up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.630
<v Speaker 0>They are all in your book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:18.190
<v Speaker 0>So generally, um, what we, what we want to know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:23.190
<v Speaker 0>is the logarithm of the product or the quotient or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,94]}

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.590
<v Speaker 0>the power, and also of the change of base.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.070
<v Speaker 0>So make sure that you remember this formula that you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.230
<v Speaker 0>know how to use them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.180
<v Speaker 0>Make sure that when you solve problems involving logarithms Rhythms.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 0>All your kind of things are in order.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,78,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 0>The bases are all the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.100
<v Speaker 0>And you're not doing, like, not allowed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.860
<v Speaker 0>Um, operations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.620
<v Speaker 0>Also, remember the, um, the, uh, sketch of the logarithm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 0>function?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.500
<v Speaker 0>That could be very, very useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.380
<v Speaker 0>You mentioned the logarithm function is 1 to 1, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 0>is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41]}

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.980
<v Speaker 0>Well, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.420
<v Speaker 0>What do we think is false?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.010
<v Speaker 1>F of x x can be equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,94,97,77,96,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.370
<v Speaker 0>I know, but I can unpack the product and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.170
<v Speaker 0>I can simplify.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.850
<v Speaker 1>To one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99]}

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.290
<v Speaker 0>Yeah exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.170
<v Speaker 0>So if you say well this question these functions are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.610
<v Speaker 0>the same because I can unpack that product that that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100,100,100]}

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 0>numerator that is x x minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 0>And I said then I can divide by x minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,87,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:59.010
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 0>And then they are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Speaker 0>And then you can say to this person well actually

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,35,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.450
<v Speaker 0>you can only do that when x is not one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:06.410
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.450
<v Speaker 0>So you can do it but you can't do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.650
<v Speaker 0>You cannot do it always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 0>So if I really, really want it to be picky,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 0>I would say that these are always the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 0>But in that one point, well, one is not defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 0>So be very careful when you do all these algebraic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,69,100]}

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:21.730
<v Speaker 0>manipulations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 0>Because behind a lot of the algebraic manipulation there are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,91,100,100]}

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 0>things that we need to find out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.550
<v Speaker 0>In this case the idea is that this function cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.470
<v Speaker 0>be the same because they don't have the same domain,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 0>They have nearly the same domain, but for one point,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 0>and therefore they're not the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100]}

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.630
<v Speaker 0>So think about the fact that the function is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.390
<v Speaker 0>just the algebraic expression, but the function is the algebraic

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.230
<v Speaker 0>expression, the domain and the range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,100]}

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 0>And so if I wanted to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.190
<v Speaker 0>To look at this I will say it's this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,78,100,76,100,100]}

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:06.950
<v Speaker 0>So the the operation I can I can divide cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,84,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 0>happen always.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.390
<v Speaker 0>So watch out for this right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 0>Also watch out for this when you simplify algebraic expression

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.190

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:30.760
<v Speaker 0>ask you again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.520
<v Speaker 0>What is functional for all?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,48,85,100,100]}

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess for all x on the domain f of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,82,95,100,97,97]}

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.320
<v Speaker 1>minus x equals minus f of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.320
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:47.720
<v Speaker 0>So we talk about all the given functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,40,100]}

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.080
<v Speaker 0>This is the definition of odd functions in a minute

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 0>in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.600
<v Speaker 0>On the slides we will also see the definition of

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.639
<v Speaker 0>an even function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.720
<v Speaker 0>And the definition of an odd function is that a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.440
<v Speaker 0>function of at or default is if for every x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,26,39,51,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 0>in the domain, the function is not defined outside the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.360
<v Speaker 0>domain, so I don't really care.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.320
<v Speaker 0>Well, nothing happens outside the domain because the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 0>not there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 0>So when you write these things, you need to write

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.560
<v Speaker 0>them properly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 0>So don't just write for me for every x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.600
<v Speaker 0>This happens because it's only for every x in the

<v Speaker 0>domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.320
<v Speaker 0>Because if the domain doesn't happen to be the order

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,58]}

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.400

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.760

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.860

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.540
<v Speaker 0>So we say that for every x in the domain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 0>I need to find that f of minus x is

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.700

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.100
<v Speaker 0>Does it happen here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,67,100]}

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.860
<v Speaker 0>Yeah it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100]}

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.580
<v Speaker 0>And we can say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,65]}

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.140
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 0>So this function is odd.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.180
<v Speaker 0>Who can give me a definition of an even function.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.060
<v Speaker 0>Well when a function is even.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.420
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Even function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100]}

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.380
<v Speaker 5>Is when um f of negative x is equal to

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.860

<v Speaker 0>X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:01.900
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 0>So an even function is when f of minus x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.500

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.700

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.660
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.700
<v Speaker 0>So because for an even function I want to see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,87,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 0>that f of x is equal to f of minus

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 0>x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 0>Let me just bring up my slides.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.730
<v Speaker 0>Then the obvious thing to think about is a function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 0>that has got only even exponents for the for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay, in this case I've got a cubic, I've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.530
<v Speaker 0>the sorry parabola, but I could have had x to

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.570
<v Speaker 0>the four plus x squared -72 and that would have

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.250

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.250

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 0>even function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 0>So I think we've got one more question to go

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:58.610

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.140
<v Speaker 6>got the 3000, and then you times that by the

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.180

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure how to like, describe it, but it's

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.340
<v Speaker 6>like, that's like the money gained and then you like

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.060
<v Speaker 6>times it by the amount of days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.380
<v Speaker 6>Kinda.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.180
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure how to explain that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,34]}

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 2>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.060
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.780
<v Speaker 0>No, that's a good explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 0>I have one more question for somebody else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.780
<v Speaker 0>So why do I have an exponent with the number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.420
<v Speaker 0>of days?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.020
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76]}

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:19.930
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, I can organise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,86]}

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 0>I can say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99]}

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.570
<v Speaker 7>It's compound interest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.970
<v Speaker 7>So it's like exponential.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.090
<v Speaker 0>Yeah it's discrete.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73]}

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:29.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.490
<v Speaker 0>Because the interest is calculated at one point each day.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.810
<v Speaker 0>And this is why you have the number of days.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a like a written down solution of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,98,79,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:38.850
<v Speaker 0>this problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:39.250
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:40.010
<v Speaker 0>That was great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.770
<v Speaker 0>So there we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.850
<v Speaker 0>This is the formula that I need to use to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.610
<v Speaker 0>calculate compound interest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.930
<v Speaker 0>And in this formula which is the same one which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 0>is in your book somewhere, which I don't remember in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.290
<v Speaker 0>the, in the chapter I have this value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:15.310
<v Speaker 0>So a is the value of the Of the investment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,56,96,100]}

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 0>after the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 0>So this is what I want to calculate, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,84]}

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 0>To have a sum of money I invested under certain

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:21.670
<v Speaker 0>condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.590
<v Speaker 0>I want to find out how much capital do I

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.950
<v Speaker 0>have after a certain period of time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.190
<v Speaker 0>P is the initial capital that is invested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:34.030
<v Speaker 0>In our case it was £3,000 and then I have

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.310
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 0>Plus R is the interest rate and is the time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 0>unit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 0>In our case we want to calculate over a year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 0>So I have 365 days in the year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.790
<v Speaker 0>Forget about leap year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.670
<v Speaker 0>We have done just some mathematical modelling here okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 0>And then t is the time after which I want

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.430

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 0>So in this case I have £3,000.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.070
<v Speaker 0>I invest in them with the interest of 5%.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 0>I get this every year.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.430
<v Speaker 0>I want to know how much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.270
<v Speaker 0>So it's a question of calculating this formula for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 0>data that we are that we have the thing which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.030
<v Speaker 0>was interesting and we had to think about, or at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.730
<v Speaker 0>least what I did this exercise I had to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.810
<v Speaker 0>about for a moment is why I'm not using the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:18.650
<v Speaker 0>last formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.730
<v Speaker 0>So the the A and the C are kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:24.530
<v Speaker 0>red herrings.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.490
<v Speaker 0>So they're just there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,98]}

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.210
<v Speaker 0>But the last one is a proper formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 0>The last one is the formula to give compound interest

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:37.970
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54]}

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.970
<v Speaker 0>To calculate this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85]}

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.930
<v Speaker 0>A equal p e to the RT.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,57]}

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.250
<v Speaker 0>And this is only given if the interesting compound it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.090
<v Speaker 0>continuously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:53.650
<v Speaker 0>So this is the difference between calculating the interest at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 0>each day and calculating the interest continuously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:00.050
<v Speaker 0>And the trick of if you like of the of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.490
<v Speaker 0>the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.410
<v Speaker 0>Not the trick, but the thing that maybe we had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:05.010
<v Speaker 0>to think about for one moment was to try and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 0>understand whether this was an interest calculated continuously, or were

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.210
