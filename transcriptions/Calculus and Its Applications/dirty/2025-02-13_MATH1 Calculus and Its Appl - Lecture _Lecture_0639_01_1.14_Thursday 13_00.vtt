WEBVTT

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 0>So today we carry on thinking about integrals and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 0>will see some other applications of integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 0>Not next week is an independent learning week, but the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 0>week after we will see even more applications of integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 0>But today I think that the main point that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 0>want to talk about is this idea of the Riemann

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 0>sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look what we can say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 0>So we have had conversations about how historically the integral

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 0>came about, because we wanted to calculate the area between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 0>a curve and the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 0>And we also said that we did this by approximation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 0>Originally we wanted to approximate, if you like, the area

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 0>one is a little bit less and one is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker 0>little bit more, and then we do a limiting process

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 0>to see what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 0>So this idea is what is behind this idea of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 0>the Riemann sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 0>The in your textbook on page five and 19 the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 0>Riemann sums are defined on a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 0>So if I have a closed interval a and b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 0>and p is a regular partition of MP, f is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 0>defined on this closed interval, then the delta x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 0>the width of each subinterval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 0>And I define the Riemann sum as that as the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 0>sum for I that goes one to an f of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,97,100,100,100,62,100,100]}

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 0>x I star delta x I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 0>The thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98]}

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 0>The only thing that we need to take care when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 0>we do exercises involving the Riemann sums, is to really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 0>understand who all these symbols are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,68,100,100]}

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 0>So in the case of the formula, The xy star

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100,95,100]}

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 0>is a point in the interval x I minus 1XI.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 0>A is a regular partition, and we said last time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 0>that the regular partition means that A is partitioned in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.210
<v Speaker 0>segments which are all the same length, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 0>So for each segment the length x I minus 1XI

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 0>minus x I minus one is the same for each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 0>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 0>That's what it means to be a regular partition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 0>And then we define delta x to be one over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 0>n b minus a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,100,100]}

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 0>And we can do that because this is a regular

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,88,77,100]}

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 0>partition okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 0>So all the n segments have the same length.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 0>This is the the definition which is in your book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 0>Now if and and we can talk about Riemann sums

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 0>for functions in general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 0>What we want to say is that if x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 0>continuous and non-negative in a b, then and that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,63,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.790
<v Speaker 0>the Riemann sum for for f, then the area under

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.150
<v Speaker 0>the curve is the limit of that sum that defines

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.750
<v Speaker 0>the limit sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,48,100]}

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.990
<v Speaker 0>So basically I am saying that if f of x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.830
<v Speaker 0>is positive, you remember why I say it is positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,94,100,100]}

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 0>Because last time we saw what happens if x if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 0>the function is under the x axis, we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 0>do something about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 0>We'll see more about this next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.750
<v Speaker 0>But so if f is positive, then I say that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 0>the area is the limit for the goes to infinity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,38,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 0>of that sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 0>So this is all more or less what there is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.430
<v Speaker 0>to know about Riemann sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 0>And let us see whether we can do some questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,46,46,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.670
<v Speaker 0>Let me just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.950
<v Speaker 0>There you are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 0>Oh come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 0>Ah, excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,91]}

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 0>So let's see whether we can do some questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.090
<v Speaker 0>Some of them will concern Riemann sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 0>The first ones will concern some applications of integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 0>And so let's do this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Well that's interesting.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100]}

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 0>I think I can be happy with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 0>the fact that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86]}

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.540
<v Speaker 0>That somebody that goes with the general consensus that that

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 0>is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 0>Somebody that can tell me why this is the case

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.940
<v Speaker 0>or what they think is the case.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.060

<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 0>So what do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 0>Why is that the case?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.419
<v Speaker 2>That's on top of the business problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,100,100,100,99,58,49]}

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Can I it's false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,78,37]}

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.010
<v Speaker 0>You can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.090
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Basically because you have to integrate twice, you have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 3>constant that you can't find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.930
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 0>So what is happening here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.610
<v Speaker 0>I have something which so in a kind of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.650
<v Speaker 0>is not in a formal way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 0>We would see the formal, the, the formal solution of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,55,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.970
<v Speaker 0>the exercise in a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 0>But the way in which we think about this exercise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,62,60]}

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.130
<v Speaker 0>is, is the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:23.210
<v Speaker 0>I have yes, I am given the acceleration a of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.290
<v Speaker 0>t, and I am given one condition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.010
<v Speaker 0>I'm given the velocity at the origin to be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.450
<v Speaker 0>Now, the way I think about the acceleration is this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,87,100,100,100]}

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 0>Variation, like the change of space with respect to time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 0>is the velocity and the change of velocity with respect

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 0>to time is acceleration.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 0>So I am doing two derivatives here right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.390
<v Speaker 0>If you start from your space, this means that I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 0>need to have two conditions in order to be able

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.150
<v Speaker 0>to find out exactly what is the point that I'm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.910
<v Speaker 0>looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.430
<v Speaker 0>In this case, I've got only one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.470
<v Speaker 0>I only know what happens in v equal zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100]}

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.110
<v Speaker 0>So ideally I would like to know what happens in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.870
<v Speaker 0>the s of zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100]}

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.230
<v Speaker 0>So in the initial moment where is in the space

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.430
<v Speaker 0>the point and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.550
<v Speaker 0>This is like a way an intuitive way of thinking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 0>about this, which is exactly what you were saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.390
<v Speaker 0>Now if I wanted to write this down properly and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 0>don't forget intuition is very important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 0>But ultimately we need to be able to write down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 0>things in mathematical language.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.950
<v Speaker 0>How would I write this down?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.670
<v Speaker 0>I would say, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 0>I know that a of t is dv dt, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.870
<v Speaker 0>so v of t is the integral of t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 0>And this is an indefinite Integral and the solution contains

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100]}

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.930
<v Speaker 0>an arbitrary constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.730
<v Speaker 0>We have seen this last time, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 0>Now I cannot find this contrast, this constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, suppose that I take these two, these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,96,72]}

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.290
<v Speaker 0>80 equal equal t square plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,74,100,95,74,100,100]}

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.090
<v Speaker 0>So I choose an 80.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,41,38]}

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.170
<v Speaker 0>And for an for v of zero we have c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.490
<v Speaker 0>one equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.610
<v Speaker 0>But I could just choose another function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 0>Which has the same properties with a different constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.090
<v Speaker 0>And I would find that the point is in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 0>different place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is the idea right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 0>The data in my in my exercise are not enough

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Speaker 0>to be able to tell me exactly what is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 0>point at the time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100]}

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 0>T.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 0>And and you can show if you had the question

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94,55,100]}

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 0>like this, you could argue first intuitively to say that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.230
<v Speaker 0>I am doing two derivatives now, but you could also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 0>show it in this way by showing a control example

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,98]}

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 0>and say, well, I have this function that satisfies the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.630
<v Speaker 0>properties, and I have this function and the points end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 0>up in different places.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 0>So what you need to do, you need to take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 0>functions with different constants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.470
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.350
<v Speaker 0>So this is the this is often a good way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 0>to think about questions like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 0>So if you want to show that something is false

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 0>produced an example where that is false okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.310
<v Speaker 0>And that will be enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100]}

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.310
<v Speaker 0>Or of course you can reason cannot deductively from what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,100,100]}

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.150
<v Speaker 0>we know from mathematics, but sometimes showing an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.270
<v Speaker 0>So if I ask you, is this true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.910
<v Speaker 0>You can tell me, no, it is not true because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 0>there is two functions that have the same like behave

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 0>like the exercise wants them to behave, and yet the

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.910
<v Speaker 0>position of points end up being different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 0>Let's do one more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.780

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 0>it's more fun when we don't see the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 0>Is this the right one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,98]}

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.460
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

<v Speaker 1>Is.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 0>There we are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.490
<v Speaker 0>So I am somewhat delighted that nobody picked two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.170
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.130
<v Speaker 0>Two is wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 0>Who can tell me why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.610
<v Speaker 0>Two is totally wrong and we are not even thinking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100]}

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.290
<v Speaker 0>about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 0>So why is not the average velocity in one minute?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:32.770
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81]}

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.410
<v Speaker 0>Sorry I was looking past you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Because by integrating velocity, we're going to get distance or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,91,91,100,100,95]}

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.690
<v Speaker 4>displacement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.370
<v Speaker 0>If you wanted the average, you would have to divide

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.670
<v Speaker 0>Bye bye.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Speaker 0>Bye.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:45.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.070
<v Speaker 0>So that's definitely not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 0>I also don't want to say the four is correct

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88,97,100,100]}

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.310
<v Speaker 0>because there is four is not correct because there is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.910
<v Speaker 0>a right answer there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100]}

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.030
<v Speaker 0>So why do we think the majority of the people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 0>that have voted between 3 and 1 think that that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 0>is the total distance in one minute?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 0>Why do we think that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:10.030
<v Speaker 0>And why is not this distance from the starting point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.189
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Because of the because of the modulus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no, uh, so because of the modulus, there's no,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.709
<v Speaker 2>like, direction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's just, uh, it'd be like measuring speed, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.390
<v Speaker 2>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.069
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Just got magnitude.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,92,100]}

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.830
<v Speaker 0>So this is exactly a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,70,100]}

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.310
<v Speaker 0>And this is something that is important to keep in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.990
<v Speaker 0>mind when you read questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.030
<v Speaker 0>Just try to think about things out there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.270
<v Speaker 0>In this case, why do I get a module right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 0>Why do I want the model of V of T.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,65,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 0>Because that is, the total distance of the sprinter is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.330
<v Speaker 0>not the distance from the starting point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 0>So if I wanted to formalise this, what would I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:53.770
<v Speaker 0>say?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.810
<v Speaker 0>So C.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.250
<v Speaker 0>Would be the distance the displacement in one minute and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 0>therefore would have no module.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 0>Like you were saying just now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:14.770
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.530
<v Speaker 0>Whilst B for the average velocity I would have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 0>divide by 16 number of seconds in a minute or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.850
<v Speaker 0>some unit, but the average implies some sort of account

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.330
<v Speaker 0>of average.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Speaker 0>So you need to know what you have divided the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 0>length of the in this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,75,94]}

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 0>In this case I think the time division of your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.650
<v Speaker 0>time unit okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86]}

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.430
<v Speaker 0>Therefore what we need is the total distance of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.790

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.070
<v Speaker 0>So next one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.150
<v Speaker 0>Wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.350
<v Speaker 1>A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh, there's no unit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,69,100,100]}

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 0>That's all right this minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,58,99,61,97]}

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:16.900
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Just a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,50,95]}

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:18.940
<v Speaker 0>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.260
<v Speaker 0>Why not?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 0>So when you have questions like this, just think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.020
<v Speaker 0>So this is obviously a question about the rate of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.140
<v Speaker 0>change of something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100]}

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.780
<v Speaker 0>So think about what is changing and in which direction

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.740
<v Speaker 0>is the change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100]}

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.580
<v Speaker 0>Is there any more clear.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,78,100,100]}

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>All.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42]}

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 1>There any.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,78]}

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Other questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,30]}

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Like that.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,82,68,43]}

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's pretty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 0>Pretty much a big vote of confidence for the first

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.780
<v Speaker 0>question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.900
<v Speaker 0>So what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.900
<v Speaker 0>The reason why I say some I said what I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.850
<v Speaker 0>said before is because in this case, we need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Speaker 0>think about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 0>Is the volume of water inside the tank, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.130
<v Speaker 0>whatever this water is, which is changing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.650
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.450
<v Speaker 0>And the amount of water in the tank is negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.450
<v Speaker 0>So the change will be negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.570
<v Speaker 0>It's not the case of a velocity that's increasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 0>In this case the change is decreasing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:59.170 --> 00:22:59.890
<v Speaker 0>So why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.130
<v Speaker 0>That is the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.730
<v Speaker 0>Who can tell me why that's the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.130
<v Speaker 0>And then we will see why the other ones cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.370
<v Speaker 0>cannot be the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:26.810
<v Speaker 0>What do we think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 0>Why the change is given by the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,100,100,100,50,100]}

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.830

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.310
<v Speaker 1>What?

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:46.950
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.510
<v Speaker 0>Not very quick.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.790
<v Speaker 0>So why is that integral?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 5>The function that we're given measures the rate of, um,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 5>water falling out, or the rate at which water falls

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.430
<v Speaker 5>out of the, um, pipe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:17.070
<v Speaker 5>And to measure the actual amount of, um, the amount

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.910
<v Speaker 5>of water that has fallen out of the pipe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Um, we'll need to integrate it because, um, integrating it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:32.790
<v Speaker 5>will give us the function of just how much water

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.850
<v Speaker 5>has been or all has come out of the pipe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.370
<v Speaker 0>So would you be able to say why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.490
<v Speaker 0>For example, the second one is not right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 0>If you don't want to say it, just say no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100]}

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.650
<v Speaker 5>But because that just gives you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 5>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 5>Actually, what does that give you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.290
<v Speaker 0>That's all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,46,99]}

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:53.770
<v Speaker 0>I can show.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:54.130
<v Speaker 1>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is of course, correct what you said.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.530
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look why that is true and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.370
<v Speaker 0>why the rest is not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.370
<v Speaker 0>Ah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56]}

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:17.850
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.050
<v Speaker 0>First of all, thank you to the comments that one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,71,100,100]}

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 0>of your colleagues gave.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 0>I have ignored units or measures here, which is very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,33,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 0>sloppy of me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.210
<v Speaker 0>The time should have some unit of measure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:32.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 0>In the context of this exercise, it doesn't really matter,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.190
<v Speaker 0>but just for good mathematical writing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.830
<v Speaker 0>That should be the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's have a look at what happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 0>This is the formalisation of what you were saying before

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.030
<v Speaker 0>right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 0>What I am looking at is the rate of change

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 0>of the water coming out of wherever the water was.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,90,100,100,100]}

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.870
<v Speaker 0>And I want to calculate this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 0>So the change of volume of the water is decreasing,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.310
<v Speaker 0>okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 0>Because the water is coming out of whatever, whatever it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 0>was.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 0>And so I can say that the water collected between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.310
<v Speaker 0>two times, which is called DBC.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52]}

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.790
<v Speaker 0>So the water collected between the times one and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.190
<v Speaker 0>time two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.590
<v Speaker 0>I don't know how you want to call them would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.150
<v Speaker 0>be given by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 0>And by the net change theorem we have that integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.470
<v Speaker 0>So this is pretty straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.950
<v Speaker 0>The only thing that we had to think about when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.540
<v Speaker 0>we have Problems of this sort.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.500
<v Speaker 0>We want to think about like the modelling, what is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100,100]}

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.340
<v Speaker 0>actually happening.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64]}

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.660
<v Speaker 0>They are not all the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 0>This is fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.540
<v Speaker 0>Let's do this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100]}

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,98,96]}

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Understand why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[4,4]}

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,75,43]}

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Year from.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[33,14]}

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[13]}

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41]}

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.310
<v Speaker 0>So we have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 0>So this exercise is once you understand how to apply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,80,80,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.190
<v Speaker 0>the formula, are all about understanding who are the main

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.830
<v Speaker 0>character in that formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100]}

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.590
<v Speaker 0>So are questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100]}

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.990
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.570
<v Speaker 0>So why is that the answer?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.370
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look at this worked out properly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 0>Oops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 0>So this is the formula that we use right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.690
<v Speaker 0>For the approximation of the area under the curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.370
<v Speaker 0>And we have seen this in the introduction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.810
<v Speaker 0>This is Riemann sums.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.330
<v Speaker 0>So in order to do exercises like this I just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.530
<v Speaker 0>need to really understand what is that x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 0>Who is f of x I, I would suggest when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 0>you do exercises involving the Riemann, the Riemann sums, that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.650
<v Speaker 0>you make yourself a kind of a table of who

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.290
<v Speaker 0>are all these, these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100]}

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.610
<v Speaker 0>So in my case f of x is my function,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.530
<v Speaker 0>is e to the x and the interval where I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.770
<v Speaker 0>want to calculate the approximation is zero three okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86]}

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 0>Delta x in this case is three to the n

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.090
<v Speaker 0>is three over n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.770
<v Speaker 0>Because on the top I would have to have b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 0>minus a by a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,100]}

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 0>In this case is equal to zero is the origin

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100,100]}

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.470
<v Speaker 0>and so is three over n and x I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,85]}

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 0>Where will be a plus delta x times y is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,66,100,100,100,100,100,100,78,100]}

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.510
<v Speaker 0>three over n delta x times I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 0>Once you have sorted this out then you know the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.270
<v Speaker 0>formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 0>And this is exactly the answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this exercise is once you kind of have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:55.270
<v Speaker 0>your understanding that I am doing an approximation of area,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.190
<v Speaker 0>and I calculate the approximation in this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.910
<v Speaker 0>There are really all about understanding who the delta x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 0>the xi the extremes are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,48,100,100,100]}

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.230
<v Speaker 0>So I want to do another one like this that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.430
<v Speaker 0>we are going to be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,71,100,100,100]}

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 0>It's going to be really fun.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.270
<v Speaker 0>So what about this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 6>Why is he doing that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,70,69]}

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.240
<v Speaker 1>How?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67]}

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 1>But.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49]}

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32]}

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 1>To take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,25]}

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.890
<v Speaker 0>I need a few more votes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:52.930
<v Speaker 0>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 0>Not a lot of people voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66]}

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 1>For you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,66]}

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a look because I've got other questions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.630
<v Speaker 0>I want to to see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,69,100,100]}

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.590
<v Speaker 0>So the answer is of course four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54]}

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.630
<v Speaker 0>So my first question is what are these expressions then.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 0>And what do they tell me the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.470
<v Speaker 0>Can anybody tell me what are these two expressions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 0>Somebody that bought it both needs to have an idea

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,81,77,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.510
<v Speaker 0>of what this expression represents.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.990
<v Speaker 0>What are they.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100]}

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Going to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,54]}

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.090
<v Speaker 0>What?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:25.690
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.690
<v Speaker 0>They're both.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.450
<v Speaker 0>They're both the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.330
<v Speaker 7>Well, the difference is that the second includes the zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 7>term and the first doesn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83]}

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.050
<v Speaker 7>And the zero term will equal to zero, so the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 7>sum doesn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:46.730
<v Speaker 0>So we call them the um limit using the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,100,99,87,100]}

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.730
<v Speaker 0>hand point and the limit using the left hand point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,99,69,100,100,100]}

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.130
<v Speaker 0>So if you have read your chapter about uh, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,85,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.330
<v Speaker 0>today, you will, you will have seen that I can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:59.690
<v Speaker 0>write the Riemann sum using the right hand point or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,79]}

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:00.650
<v Speaker 0>the left hand point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100]}

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.570
<v Speaker 0>So I start from different places a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.370
<v Speaker 0>So the picture you need to have in your head,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.090
<v Speaker 0>which is not the true representation of what is going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 0>on, it's just an image to to help you is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.490
<v Speaker 0>the same thing as if I wanted to calculate an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:14.090
<v Speaker 0>area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.650
<v Speaker 0>Of something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,100]}

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 0>And I couldn't do integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.310
<v Speaker 0>I could go from the bottom.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:28.310
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:29.710
<v Speaker 0>And then approximate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.790
<v Speaker 0>Or I could overshoot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:33.950
<v Speaker 0>That's the picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 0>So you go from both sides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 0>Now this is not quite what happened with the Riemann

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.590
<v Speaker 0>sums, but the idea is the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.750
<v Speaker 0>So this represents the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.470
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at what they represent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,55,88,99]}

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 0>The same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.310
<v Speaker 0>How do I calculate them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 0>And so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.990
<v Speaker 0>First of all one point about what the exercise is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 0>asking you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 0>So despite the fact that we have said that historically,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.950
<v Speaker 0>we think about Riemann sums to calculate areas under curves.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.870
<v Speaker 0>The exercise is not asking you for an area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.670
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.830
<v Speaker 0>Would you agree with me?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:11.310
<v Speaker 0>So in this case the outcome of this limit may

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.550
<v Speaker 0>be negative and that would be fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,61,100,100]}

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.830
<v Speaker 0>It's like when you have an integral which is negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.110
<v Speaker 0>We will see next week a little bit more in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.870
<v Speaker 0>details.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 0>Else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.060
<v Speaker 0>But we have also mentioned this is on Monday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,91,79,89]}

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 0>When you are requested to find an area, then you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.740
<v Speaker 0>need to think about the sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.300
<v Speaker 0>When you are requested to calculate some integral or some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100]}

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.020
<v Speaker 0>limit and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.900
<v Speaker 0>Then we take whatever sign that comes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.180
<v Speaker 0>But just to show you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 0>That curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.500
<v Speaker 0>Looks like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 0>So that's the function that we have in the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.220
<v Speaker 0>And that is the um what it looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.100
<v Speaker 0>And it has a minimum there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:52.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.020
<v Speaker 0>And you said no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,71,92,94]}

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.980
<v Speaker 0>If I had asked you for the area, then my

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.460
<v Speaker 0>thinking would be different because there is a part of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 0>the curve which is under the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.940
<v Speaker 0>So I would have to think about the sine of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100]}

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.180
<v Speaker 0>that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 0>But this exercise is only asking you for the limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 0>of the Riemann sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.660
<v Speaker 0>It's like if I was asking you for the integral

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.620
<v Speaker 0>between 0 and 4 of that curve.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,98,98,100,79,100]}

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.600
<v Speaker 0>But in any case, I think it is sure was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,58,58,58,87]}

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.480
<v Speaker 0>positive to try to make yourself a picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 0>Even if you want to go on Desmos and ask

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,99,74]}

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.040
<v Speaker 0>Desmos to make yourself a picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.880
<v Speaker 0>So don't want to work out maximum, minimum, and so

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 0>on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.200
<v Speaker 0>Which is useful because you will do this later on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.960
<v Speaker 0>in the course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.800
<v Speaker 0>But so this is my function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.600
<v Speaker 0>Now suppose that I want to calculate the using rate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,63]}

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 0>and points okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100]}

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.720
<v Speaker 0>When I use right hand points by convention I start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,55,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 0>my sums from one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100]}

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.400
<v Speaker 0>So I say that my integral is the limit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 0>I that goes from one to n of that expression.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.280
<v Speaker 0>If you go in with all the items that we

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.800
<v Speaker 0>have seen before, this is exactly what you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,98,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.600
<v Speaker 0>And the limit is calculated by finding what the by

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.720
<v Speaker 0>knowing what the sum for I to n of a

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.440
<v Speaker 0>I square m from I from one to n on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.400
<v Speaker 0>I is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.160
<v Speaker 0>You should know these things from school, but we will

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.340
<v Speaker 0>have also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.780
<v Speaker 0>There will be a unit later on which is about

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 0>things like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 0>So that is my calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.700
<v Speaker 0>So then I go and solve that limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.500
<v Speaker 0>And sorry, I'm not quite sure what's happened.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.900
<v Speaker 0>And that's what I find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.940
<v Speaker 0>We know about limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.300
<v Speaker 0>We've done it last week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.940
<v Speaker 0>So this is what they found.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,100]}

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.620
<v Speaker 0>Now suppose that I am not satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.700
<v Speaker 0>And I want you to calculate the Riemann sum from

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.380
<v Speaker 0>the left hand.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.220
<v Speaker 0>From the left hand point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.900
<v Speaker 0>If I wanted to do that, then that sum would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.340
<v Speaker 0>start from zero and would be the sum from I

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.500
<v Speaker 0>from zero to n minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 0>Now what is the thing I need to to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80,100,100]}

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.220
<v Speaker 0>one minute?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 0>Careful if I want to do this calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.580
<v Speaker 0>I mean I can plug in the formula like I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 0>did before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.780
<v Speaker 0>I've got the delta X and all this kind of

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.260
<v Speaker 0>stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 0>Well I don't know what that is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.050
<v Speaker 0>What do I need to be careful about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 0>What do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100]}

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:20.890
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Is it that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84]}

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.570
<v Speaker 2>The function needs to be continuous?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise the right and left endpoints won't approximate to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,85,82,100,98,100]}

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.570
<v Speaker 2>same thing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.810
<v Speaker 0>Yes, but we know that the function is continuous because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.330
<v Speaker 0>we actually have the the actual expression of the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.970
<v Speaker 0>In this not in this case, but there is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,81,81,100]}

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.090
<v Speaker 0>general consideration I need to think about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:41.970
<v Speaker 0>Well, no, but a little bit more general than that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,25,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.370
<v Speaker 0>but not completely general.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,98,100,100]}

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:44.850
<v Speaker 0>What could that be?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.170
<v Speaker 0>So but if you want to apply this formula and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.930
<v Speaker 0>you wanted to calculate the the other Riemann sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:08.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 0>This is the something that I said before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,74,62,96,100]}

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.810
<v Speaker 0>And obviously when we do this exercise, it's actually it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.410
<v Speaker 0>always a good idea to go and check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.110
<v Speaker 0>Take one minute to do this integral, okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.190
<v Speaker 0>And if your limit is different from this integral then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.150
<v Speaker 0>you need to worry about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.350
<v Speaker 0>But in this case it's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.230
<v Speaker 0>That's the limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100]}

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Now what I want to draw your attention on is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:30.910
<v Speaker 0>that in order to calculate this limit, I have put

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:36.230
<v Speaker 0>into my expression the value of the sum for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.830
<v Speaker 0>I then goes from to n I and I square.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,69,100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.310
<v Speaker 0>These sums are calculated in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.830
<v Speaker 0>In order to have that sum, the the index needs

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 0>to go from one to n.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.870
<v Speaker 0>So what happens if the index goes from zero to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:50.870
<v Speaker 0>n minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 0>So you cannot just plug this in when you calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.590
<v Speaker 0>the left hand side the left point right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.910
<v Speaker 0>You need to think about what happens to the sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.550
<v Speaker 0>And it's not too difficult actually to think about this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.510
<v Speaker 0>because what you do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.330
<v Speaker 0>Is this you take the formula that you know, when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.210
<v Speaker 0>you have the sum from from one to n and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.610
<v Speaker 0>you replace n minus one instead of n, because this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.930
<v Speaker 0>time your sum in between 0 and -1 and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.450
<v Speaker 0>formula slightly changes, as you can see there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 0>So in the in the first two formulas you replace

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100]}

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.930
<v Speaker 0>n minus n with n minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,66,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.850
<v Speaker 0>You obtain the formulas at the bottom, and then these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 0>are the formulas you use to put in the limits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,63,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.810
<v Speaker 0>to calculate the left hand points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.730
<v Speaker 0>So to recap, when we do exercises of this sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.890
<v Speaker 0>and you look at summations on the natural numbers, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.770
<v Speaker 0>point where you start and the point where you stop

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.810
<v Speaker 0>are important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.290
<v Speaker 0>So if you just replace in the left hand point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 0>calculation, the sum, the value of the sum from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 0>to n, you would have been a bit in trouble.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.970
<v Speaker 0>But if you do this, then you can do all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.770
<v Speaker 0>your calculations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.370
<v Speaker 0>I've done them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100]}

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.090
<v Speaker 0>It works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.090
<v Speaker 0>You take exactly the same value, which is what you

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:16.470
<v Speaker 0>wanted, because you are taking a limit from basically from

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.550
<v Speaker 0>an overshoot and an undershoot of some approximation.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 0>I think we have time for one more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 0>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 0>What time is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.430
<v Speaker 0>Gosh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 0>Quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.990
<v Speaker 0>Very quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:31.190
<v Speaker 0>Let's try to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:33.470
<v Speaker 0>We got four minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100]}

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:39.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.720
<v Speaker 0>So in the last minute and a half of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 0>lecture because then I need to let you go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 0>We have said in the course of commenting on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.720
<v Speaker 0>exercise before that that must be true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.120
<v Speaker 0>That two expressions limits to the same value, because the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.480
<v Speaker 0>two expressions, the limit of that expression under the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.040
<v Speaker 0>conditions, of course, the function is continuous and is defined

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.560
<v Speaker 0>in the integral in the interval and all that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,75,56,100]}

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 0>The limit is the integral and the integral is one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.040
<v Speaker 0>integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.780
<v Speaker 0>So these two limiting processes needs to to be going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,96,100,100,100]}

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.660
<v Speaker 0>to the same place.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't matter in the end.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.300
<v Speaker 0>If I go right and point to the left hand

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,56,89,100,82]}

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 0>point, if I then take the limit, because that is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.900
<v Speaker 0>going to give me the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.140
<v Speaker 0>So I'll see, you know, independent learning week next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:28.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.460
<v Speaker 0>So see you Monday Monday next week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:04.940
<v Speaker 1>All.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77]}

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh, wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 2>We can always, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,98,69]}

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Wait wait wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Wait wait wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100]}

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:21.990
<v Speaker 1>We can always, uh, uh, interview as, uh, for me

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,90,100,93,100,100]}

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 1>as a form of submission.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 1>So, uh, so you guys, the reason is, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,98,78,78,100,100,100,86]}

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.910
<v Speaker 8>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.910
<v Speaker 8>When we calculate the stream of funds, we find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,76,82,99,100,100,51]}

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.910
<v Speaker 8>songs that have known songs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,39]}

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.510
<v Speaker 8>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.990
<v Speaker 8>So then it's interesting to see how this changes people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,97,78,93]}

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 8>in the rest of the world, because the approximation is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,63,63,63,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.190
<v Speaker 8>quite different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,68]}

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 8>The price of this is not just to raise awareness,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,79,56,56,79,14,100,100,100,100]}

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.630
<v Speaker 8>they just use that term.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,99,97,97,84]}

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:07.570
<v Speaker 8>And if you have different information and I mean, in

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:10.530
<v Speaker 8>this particular exercise, because of the function that it will

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:13.570
<v Speaker 8>give the points and the intervals.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.730
<v Speaker 8>The theorem works out that we use these two sums,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,36,100,100,100,100,89,91,100,100]}

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:17.810
<v Speaker 8>but there may be others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,91]}

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.050
<v Speaker 8>They use other things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,88,100,100]}

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:19.530
<v Speaker 8>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 8>It is just something to show that there needs to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,73,100,100,100,100,100,86,86,98]}

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.530
<v Speaker 8>be room for all of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,89,100,100,100,80]}

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.170
<v Speaker 8>That's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100]}

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:24.970
<v Speaker 8>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 8>I think not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75]}

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.730
