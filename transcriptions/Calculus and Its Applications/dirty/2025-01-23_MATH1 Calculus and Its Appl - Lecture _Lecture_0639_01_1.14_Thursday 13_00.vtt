<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.040
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, whatever.

<v Speaker 0>Squeezed in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 0>And you see limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 0>You're like, squeeze theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,99,99]}

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Now, the thing is, you cannot immediately unless you remember

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.080
<v Speaker 0>the statement by heart of the squeeze theorem, you cannot

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.040
<v Speaker 0>immediately apply it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.200
<v Speaker 0>You have to be careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 0>But your first instinct is, oh, this looks like it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 0>could use the squeeze theorem, but your next step should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 0>be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.980
<v Speaker 0>Oh, let me go and check the statement and see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.420
<v Speaker 0>if it really applies here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 0>Because maybe I cannot apply that theorem because some of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.260
<v Speaker 0>the assumptions of the theorem are not satisfied.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 0>So I you have your squeeze theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.140
<v Speaker 0>And uh, let me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91,100,100]}

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,21]}

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Uh, that's that's not great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.860
<v Speaker 0>That's not great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.540
<v Speaker 0>Well, unfortunately, now I know how to fix this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.979
<v Speaker 0>I know how to fix this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.659
<v Speaker 0>I will switch one of them to cam, and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.659
<v Speaker 0>will write the question now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 0>So we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 0>So we have f of x is Minus one over

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:52.890
<v Speaker 0>three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.370
<v Speaker 0>X cubed plus x squared minus seven over three.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.170
<v Speaker 0>And we have h of x cosine phi over two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 0>x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.210
<v Speaker 0>We have this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 0>When x is close enough whatever that means to two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.090
<v Speaker 0>So those are the assumptions in our in the in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.930
<v Speaker 0>the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 0>Now let's go check your squeeze theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.330
<v Speaker 0>So your squeeze theorem is where I will find it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 0>now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 0>And together we'll check if it's good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.970
<v Speaker 0>It's right here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 0>So let's check that the assumptions of the theorem apply.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.710
<v Speaker 0>So we need f, g and h x to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 0>defined for all x not equal to A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 0>A in this case is two right on an open

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100]}

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.430
<v Speaker 0>interval containing a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 0>Well, we're lucky this one holds everywhere because what do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 0>we have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.150
<v Speaker 0>We have a nice polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.590
<v Speaker 0>Polynomials are defined everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 0>And we have cosine which is also defined everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.390
<v Speaker 0>So the first assumption of the theorem is satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.670
<v Speaker 0>This one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 0>Good check.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's move on to the next one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.350
<v Speaker 0>Now for this one we have to be slightly more

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 0>careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:47.750
<v Speaker 0>Right now this holds for x not equal to two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 0>in an open interval Containing a write all.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,57]}

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.650
<v Speaker 0>So our question tells us that this holds when x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,100]}

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 0>is close enough to two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 0>So let's make some sense of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.530
<v Speaker 0>And to make some sense of this I will have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 0>to show you some graphs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.770
<v Speaker 0>On GeoGebra.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:23.650
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I, I sketched the the functions that are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.850
<v Speaker 0>in the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.610
<v Speaker 0>So the green one is the polynomial and the blue

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 0>one is the cosine obviously.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,88]}

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.610
<v Speaker 0>Now let's look what happens right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 0>So this this makes sense when we're somewhere here right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 0>It doesn't make sense for example here because Because here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 0>the blue graph lies above the sorry, the green graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.510
<v Speaker 0>The polynomial lies above the blue one, but around two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 0>And that's where we're interested.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 0>That's the region we're interested in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.750
<v Speaker 0>This is fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:14.190
<v Speaker 0>So our question tells us that the this third, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 0>function, whose limit we want to compute it lies somewhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.430
<v Speaker 0>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.830
<v Speaker 0>It lies here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 0>And it doesn't matter that they intersect at two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100]}

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.430
<v Speaker 0>Because the point two we're not really interested in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 0>Because you see, it says x not equal to two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 0>But if we take an open interval around two, for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 0>example, I don't know the interval from 0 to 4

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.870
<v Speaker 0>or from 1 to 3 or like even a very

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100]}

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.900
<v Speaker 0>small one here, like from One and a half to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 0>two and a half.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.340
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 0>It just has to be open.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.660
<v Speaker 0>Then this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.980
<v Speaker 0>This is fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 0>We are okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 0>And our question tells us that this also this condition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.060
<v Speaker 0>is also satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.420
<v Speaker 0>So we have an interval which shows an interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.820
<v Speaker 0>Let's say from 1 to 3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:17.580
<v Speaker 0>And this this inequality is satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:24.700
<v Speaker 0>So both assumptions of the squeeze theorem are now satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.100
<v Speaker 0>So we're safe.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 0>And we can say that the function that's in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 0>middle, its limit at the point two at this point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.580
<v Speaker 0>will be the same as the limit of these two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 0>functions at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about what I have said until

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,87,100,100]}

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 0>this point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.040
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.880
<v Speaker 0>So I have to come closer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.280
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 0>Oh, excellent question, excellent question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>Very good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.760
<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,91]}

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 0>Excellent question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 0>Very important question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 0>What does what is an open interval?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.600
<v Speaker 0>Uh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,97]}

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.680
<v Speaker 0>So in, in this course.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.840
<v Speaker 0>So or for functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well no let us say on R right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,69,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 0>We're interested in the real rail line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.780
<v Speaker 0>Open intervals are intervals of the form.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.700
<v Speaker 0>A b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88]}

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.500
<v Speaker 0>So for example A, where a is less than b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:08.980
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 0>And the endpoints are not included.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:19.540
<v Speaker 0>So it's here this part where unfortunately I don't have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.220
<v Speaker 0>another colour of a pad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,39]}

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.060
<v Speaker 0>But these these points are not included.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.780
<v Speaker 0>So basically all the points between A and B not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.300

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.580
<v Speaker 0>So right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,72]}

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 0>That's a let me zoom out so that you can

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 0>see this better.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93]}

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.580
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 0>So all the points.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 0>Between A and B not.

<v Unknown>Including.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.730
<v Unknown>A and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 0>Does that answer the question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.330
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 0>But that's a very good question because it's, uh, this

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.330
<v Speaker 0>is one of the.

<v Speaker 0>Open sets or open intervals.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.650
<v Speaker 0>Uh, in this case, we're interested in an interval.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.090
<v Speaker 0>Uh, are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,99]}

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.890
<v Speaker 0>The they are the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 0>You will see it maybe next here or maybe later.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,58,100,100,100]}

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.510
<v Speaker 0>But they are the basis of something called topology on

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.230
<v Speaker 0>your space.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.670
<v Speaker 0>It's crucial that you understand what it is.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.310
<v Speaker 0>So now that we've taken care of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100,100,99]}

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's go back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 0>Maybe like this.

<v Speaker 0>Oh, actually sorry.

<v Speaker 0>Sorry about that.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:11.910
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:14.630
<v Speaker 0>So that was the open interval business.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:18.510
<v Speaker 0>Now we can apply the squeeze theorem because we checked

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 0>that everything's satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,47,99]}

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:34.350
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, uh, using the squeeze theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.330

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 0>We looked at the question and we thought, oh, that

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:30.090
<v Speaker 0>Now the thing is, Uh, in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.570
<v Speaker 0>So what's the problem in this case?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.610
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so those of you who voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.970
<v Speaker 0>No, it's the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.610
<v Speaker 0>But what was the problem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.410
<v Speaker 0>Why did you vote?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:42.770
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.930
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,97]}

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 0>Did you raise your hand?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Unknown>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.050
<v Unknown>It is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,79]}

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.490
<v Speaker 0>So the problem is at the point where x equals

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.450
<v Speaker 0>one, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:12.930
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.010
<v Speaker 0>Very good indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:20.730
<v Speaker 0>So the problem is that this function is not defined

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.130
<v Speaker 0>when x equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.910
<v Speaker 0>So and Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.910
<v Speaker 0>So the answer is no.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:46.470
<v Speaker 0>Because the function is not defined at x equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.670
<v Speaker 0>And if you're not defined at that point, you can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.790
<v Speaker 0>be continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.950
<v Speaker 0>And by the way x equals one belongs to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.670
<v Speaker 0>open interval zero three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:03.910
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.270
<v Speaker 0>It's uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 0>So the first assumption there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99]}

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.870
<v Speaker 0>So this one is violated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.750
<v Speaker 0>It's not continuous at every point because the point one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.510
<v Speaker 0>is here and the function is not continuous at that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 0>point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.700
<v Speaker 0>So this function is not continuous on the on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.620
<v Speaker 0>close interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 0>So remember the definition of continuity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.700
<v Speaker 0>We needed the the the limit at the point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,71,100,100]}

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 0>equal the value of the function at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 0>So we cannot it cannot be continuous at all because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,61,100]}

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 0>the function doesn't even have a value at one okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:57.700
<v Speaker 0>So this function is not continuous at the on this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.500
<v Speaker 0>interval because it is not even defined at one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.780
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.940
<v Speaker 0>Just a matter of checking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.100
<v Speaker 0>Going back to definitions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.860
<v Speaker 0>So looking at the definitions and see if they are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:20.780
<v Speaker 0>satisfied.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:24.020
<v Speaker 0>Okay next question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:25.060
<v Speaker 0>Why is that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 0>Why are they also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:26.919
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.399
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Speaker 0>So often we will see functions given in this form

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,100,100,74,100,100,100]}

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.720
<v Speaker 0>where it's given by one by some kind of formula

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 0>on one part of the real line and by another

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.639
<v Speaker 0>formula on the other part of the real line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.480
<v Speaker 0>And you have to check some statements about these functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:16.590
<v Speaker 0>Uh, all right, so we have some, uh, uh, we're

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,100,63,98,100]}

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.470
<v Speaker 0>voting a bit more reluctantly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 0>Um, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.540
<v Speaker 0>And we have, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,88]}

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 0>Well, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's, let's let's discuss this together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.220
<v Speaker 0>Um, when you have a function of this form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.260
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.020
<v Speaker 0>So you see that if x is less than one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 0>uh, your function is x squared, which is a nice,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.020
<v Speaker 0>uh, polynomial function, and it is continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.660
<v Speaker 0>Uh, everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100]}

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well, actually everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 0>And when x is greater than or equal to one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.500
<v Speaker 0>you have the square root which is also a nice

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.780
<v Speaker 0>continuous function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:06.500
<v Speaker 0>So your only problem could be where they meet because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.580
<v Speaker 0>you don't know how they meet and what happens there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.700
<v Speaker 0>So we need to investigate whether it's continuous at this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.780
<v Speaker 0>point where they meet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.640
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.280
<v Speaker 0>Well, let's do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.720
<v Speaker 0>So let's do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:25.960
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.520
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:30.920
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.120
<v Speaker 0>Let me just put that here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100]}

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:32.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.680
<v Speaker 0>We need to see what happens at.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.320
<v Speaker 0>At the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.120
<v Speaker 0>X equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:48.720
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.000
<v Speaker 0>So the value of the function f at one is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.440
<v Speaker 0>So we are in this situation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.680
<v Speaker 0>So it's one here is square root of one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 0>So one good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.000
<v Speaker 0>Uh so in order to check continuity we have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.240
<v Speaker 0>check if the limit at that point is also one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 0>So to check continuity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:23.140
<v Speaker 0>Uh, need to check if limit as x goes to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.340
<v Speaker 0>one of f.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Speaker 0>Uh, x is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:29.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.460
<v Speaker 0>So we need to evaluate the left limit and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 0>right limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:42.100
<v Speaker 0>So as x goes to one from the left of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.580
<v Speaker 0>f of x is what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.580
<v Speaker 0>So when x is less than one it's this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 0>Well this is just one right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:05.100
<v Speaker 0>So I chose I'm using this function because when we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.900
<v Speaker 0>go when we approach one from the left it's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,86]}

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.100
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:09.580
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 0>Our function is equal to x squared and the limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340
<v Speaker 0>is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 0>Now when we approach one from the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 0>Oh, sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 0>This is equal to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 0>Now the function becomes a square root of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.530
<v Speaker 0>Because when you're greater than one it's the square root

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.090
<v Speaker 0>of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 0>Well but the limit here is also one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:43.410
<v Speaker 0>So thus the we have limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,75]}

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.650
<v Speaker 0>Of f of x from the left equals limit of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:56.610
<v Speaker 0>f of x from the right and equals f at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:57.090
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 0>Hence f is continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.570
<v Speaker 0>At x equals one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.270
<v Speaker 0>So what did we what did we do to summarise?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.830
<v Speaker 0>Uh, we, uh the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.070
<v Speaker 0>We realised that the only problem this function could have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.190
<v Speaker 0>was that the place where these functions meet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:27.870
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.510
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so at one and then we investigated the behaviour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.110
<v Speaker 0>of that function, namely the continuity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.910
<v Speaker 0>And we realised that the left limit equals the right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.790
<v Speaker 0>limit and equals the value of the function at that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:43.190
<v Speaker 0>point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 0>Hence it is continuous at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.190
<v Speaker 0>And therefore this whole thing is continuous everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.590
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 0>Do you have a question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.430
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.230
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 0>So and let's let's maybe solve one more question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.630
<v Speaker 0>Uh here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.150
<v Speaker 0>This should be relatively simple because we have seen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.890
<v Speaker 0>something about this in the previous lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Thank.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.680
<v Speaker 0>Um, we have two minutes left, So let's discuss the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.200
<v Speaker 0>answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[28]}

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.480
<v Speaker 0>Well, the as overwhelming as the overwhelming majority chose false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.680
<v Speaker 0>And they are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 0>So what's the problem here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.080
<v Speaker 0>Well, we also need the function to be defined at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:30.800
<v Speaker 0>the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100]}

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.240
<v Speaker 0>And we need the value of the function to agree

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.400
<v Speaker 0>with those limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.600
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 0>So this statement is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.640
<v Speaker 0>It's false because yeah you can have the two limits

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 0>existing and agreeing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 0>But the function will not be defined at the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,37,100]}

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 0>And in fact I will remind you we had we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 0>had an example in the previous lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.200
<v Speaker 0>Remember here like both limits exist and equal but the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.460
<v Speaker 0>function is not defined here, hence it's not continuous at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100]}

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 0>that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is all for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.100
<v Speaker 0>Um, I will see you in week four and at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:22.940
<v Speaker 0>the workshops.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97]}

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:23.940
<v Speaker 0>Thank you very much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}
