00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 0>Hi.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 0>Hello everyone.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 0>So welcome to week four of calculus and its applications.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 0>So today we'll talk about the application of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 0>So last week you saw will you define derivatives and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,71,100,82,100,100]}

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 0>you studied some properties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 0>And today we will learn about the applications of derivatives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 0>And there are plenty because indeed it's you know it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,95,99,99,100]}

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 0>the one of the uh oh here it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,93,73,100,100,100]}

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 0>Uh, it's one of the fundamental, uh, um, definitions in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 0>calculus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 0>So here are all the, uh, um, all the applications

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,83,81,100,100,100]}

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 0>listed in your textbook.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 0>And today we will look, uh, we will solve problems,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 0>uh, related to some of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 0>And we will continue on with the others on Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 0>So let's jump right in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 0>So the, uh, the well, it depends on your point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 0>of view, but for me, uh, what a derivative is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 0>is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 0>First of all, first and foremost, a linear approximation of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Speaker 0>a function at a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 0>So in this question we ask you to find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 0>linear approximation to this function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.400
<v Speaker 0>Sorry cubic root of one plus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 0>And we wanted at point A equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 0>And now I will uh I will load that on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,60,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.510
<v Speaker 0>We'll clap for you so that you can vote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[57,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 0>Let's see if that's okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 0>That should work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.950
<v Speaker 0>And let me hide the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so a couple of minutes for this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[26]}

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37]}

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.130
<v Speaker 2>This is for the first time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,85,81,100,77]}

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98]}

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93]}

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Very much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38,38]}

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.050
<v Speaker 1>So check it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,75,75]}

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,65]}

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.450
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,86]}

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Should.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Not be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,98]}

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Surprised.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>That.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72]}

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.380
<v Speaker 2>They Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35,86]}

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[34]}

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.419
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.860
<v Speaker 0>I think we can, uh, we can look at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Speaker 0>results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 0>So what are the results?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.820
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 0>I tend to agree with the majority.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.800
<v Speaker 0>So let's see why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 0>Well, to be honest, this is not a very deep

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.720
<v Speaker 0>question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 0>You just have to remember the definition of a linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 0>approximation at a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.840
<v Speaker 0>So here's the definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100]}

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.480
<v Speaker 0>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.080
<v Speaker 0>You need to find your derivative at the at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 0>point of interest.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 0>And so this is just the formula that's in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 0>book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 0>Basically this is a very computational exercise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to think much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.480
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.920
<v Speaker 0>You don't have to think much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 0>Just know the formula and.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.480
<v Speaker 0>Plug in the numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.160
<v Speaker 0>So if you calculate the derivative of this function it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 0>this this is the expression you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.340
<v Speaker 0>You evaluate it at zero because that's the point you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,71,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 0>want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.980
<v Speaker 0>So you put a you need to put it there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 0>And so this the this is the expression you obtain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 0>And once you, um, you know, compute everything you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 0>one plus one over three x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 0>It's just as I said, there is not much, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.060
<v Speaker 0>nothing really deep going on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.700
<v Speaker 0>You just have to know the formula for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 0>I mean, if you if you think about it, of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 0>course, you can make everything deep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 0>You can think about why this is true and everything,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 0>but, uh, you don't need all that to answer the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.500
<v Speaker 0>question, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.570
<v Speaker 0>Okay, well let's move on to the to the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 0>question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 0>So determine the two positive numbers whose sum is 300

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.570
<v Speaker 0>and whose product is a maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.530
<v Speaker 0>So you need to find two positive numbers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.490
<v Speaker 0>So sum is 300.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.770
<v Speaker 0>And the product is the maximum value that you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.810
<v Speaker 0>obtain out of all the numbers who hold the positive

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,35,60,100,100]}

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.770
<v Speaker 0>numbers whose sum is 300?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.010
<v Speaker 0>Is the question clear?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,86]}

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 0>Here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 0>This is the question I am asking them in in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,80,100,100,90,100]}

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.570
<v Speaker 0>a different order today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, wait, let me hide the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[55]}

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.670
<v Speaker 0>We have, uh, most people voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 0>Let's see the results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 0>Nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 0>So the results are, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh, wait.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.630
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so I will display the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.510
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.770
<v Speaker 0>Um, so let's let's see why this is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so obviously another important application of, uh, derivative is,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 0>uh, finding maxima and minima of a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.010
<v Speaker 0>And there are, um, but you cannot just blindly, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.290
<v Speaker 0>know, uh, do things you have to think about which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.650
<v Speaker 0>results you're using.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,71,98]}

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.930
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:20.050
<v Speaker 0>Well, first, let's, uh, denote the numbers by x and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.170
<v Speaker 0>uh, 300 minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100]}

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 0>So we have to maximise the following function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 0>And um, uh, something that, you know, is very tempting

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,95,95,100,100,100]}

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.970
<v Speaker 0>to do and indeed will work in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.410
<v Speaker 0>Just find the derivative, set it equal to zero and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.570
<v Speaker 0>see, uh, what point you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 0>So let's see what kind of solution you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,42,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, so setting the derivative equal to zero in this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.000
<v Speaker 0>case will give you a 150.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,73,100]}

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.000
<v Speaker 0>So this is the only critical point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 0>So is this a maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.480
<v Speaker 0>And does the maximum occur at this point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 0>So to theoretically justify this result you have to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.640
<v Speaker 0>of uh you have to use a very important theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.720
<v Speaker 0>Uh it's the extreme value theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.360
<v Speaker 0>So if your function is continuous over the closed bounded

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.480
<v Speaker 0>interval AB, then there is a point at which f

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.840
<v Speaker 0>has an absolute maximum over AB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.360
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so I will not say anything about the minimum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.020
<v Speaker 0>We need the maximum here, and the location is either

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 0>at the critical point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 0>So where your derivative is zero or at the end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 0>point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49]}

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.100
<v Speaker 0>So we have to check the behaviour of the function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,84,100,100,100]}

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 0>at the end point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,77,73]}

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.459
<v Speaker 0>Lucky for us, at the end points we just get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,61,61,100,100,100]}

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So the values of this function at the end point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,55,40]}

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.020
<v Speaker 0>just give us zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 0>So obviously that can't be the maximum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.540
<v Speaker 0>So indeed the point that we we found was the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.620
<v Speaker 0>point of maximum and the value of the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.420
<v Speaker 0>22,500.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.660
<v Speaker 0>Um, so that's it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,100,100,98]}

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.180
<v Speaker 0>There's that's it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100]}

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.620
<v Speaker 0>So the point of this question was that, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.220
<v Speaker 0>you should find the critical points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 0>But also don't forget what happens at the at the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.440
<v Speaker 0>end of your interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100]}

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.720
<v Speaker 0>In this case, it wasn't relevant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.840
<v Speaker 0>It didn't give us the maximum, but sometimes it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.560
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.280
<v Speaker 0>This question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a second.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.200
<v Speaker 0>Because we have time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.960
<v Speaker 2>That's good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.840
<v Speaker 0>So we use the extreme value theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.120
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.440
<v Speaker 0>Let's move on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.720
<v Speaker 0>Oh this is my favourite question in today's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,89,100,100,92]}

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 0>Uh, well, yeah, in today's lecture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:39.320
<v Speaker 0>So Alex is driving from Edinburgh to Glasgow and the

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 0>and the radar measures Alex's speed at this time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.740
<v Speaker 0>Will Alex get a speeding ticket?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:18.860

<v Speaker 0>Here's Alex.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.820
<v Speaker 0>And of course, we have to be cautious of which

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.420

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.280
<v Speaker 0>The.

<v Speaker 0>Well, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.080

<v Speaker 0>Uh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.760
<v Speaker 0>So, uh, we think Alex will get a speeding ticket,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 0>and I agree with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.400
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but, uh, what was the result we used?

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 0>Basically.

<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.100
<v Speaker 1>The times of the speed cameras.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>The distance between them shows us that Alex went to

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.780

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You can get an average speed of 68mph, which is

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot higher than 60.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,82]}

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.900
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.340
<v Speaker 0>So the average speed was a lot higher than 60.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.300
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 0>So the speed limit is 60.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 0>And why does this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.140
<v Speaker 0>So what's the result that tells us that at some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 0>point the speed had to exceed 60.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 0>Very good value theorem indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.620
<v Speaker 0>So it's one of my favourite theorems.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:35.520
<v Speaker 0>So you know, it's it's a it's not a bike.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,99,22]}

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 0>It may not be very impressive, but it lurks in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.520
<v Speaker 0>a lot of results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.120
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.840
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 0>So by recall the mean value theorem that if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.240
<v Speaker 0>have a continuous function on a closed interval and it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92]}

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 0>differentiable on the open interval within that closed interval, then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.320
<v Speaker 0>there exists a point in the open interval such that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.960
<v Speaker 0>the average of the function is equals the the derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.040
<v Speaker 0>at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 0>As.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75]}

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.200
<v Speaker 0>And as we said we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 0>The first camera detects Alex at 14 miles sorry from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,100]}

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 0>Edinburgh at 1015.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100]}

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.830
<v Speaker 0>And then 15 minutes later He's at or they're at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.950
<v Speaker 0>31 miles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.470
<v Speaker 0>So Alex travelled 17 miles in 15 minutes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.910
<v Speaker 0>And that gives us the average speed of 68mph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 0>Therefore, by the mean value theorem, at some point the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,49]}

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 0>so the the the speed must have been 68mph, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,99,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 0>exceeds the speed limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 0>So once again this is the statement.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 0>And uh, here is another, uh, you know, if you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:21.110
<v Speaker 0>ask like several people what's what the derivative means to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:21.550
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 0>They will, uh, probably give you a different answers, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.710
<v Speaker 0>one of them will be the instantaneous speed at the,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.910
<v Speaker 0>at the, at a point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,90,100]}

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:36.290
<v Speaker 0>So we are exploiting that the definition of a derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 0>or that interpretation of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.770
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.410
<v Speaker 0>Well done.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:43.690
<v Speaker 0>Uh, next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.130
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100]}

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 0>So I like the mean value theorem so much that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 0>I don't want to leave it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.930
<v Speaker 0>So one of the corollaries of the mean value theorem

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:54.050 --> 00:29:00.370
<v Speaker 0>is that, uh, um, so, uh, if you have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,99,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 0>continuous function on a closed interval and differentiable on an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 0>open interval, and then the sign of its derivative tells

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 0>you whether your, uh, function is strictly increasing, decreasing, or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 0>constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.770
<v Speaker 0>So this is a consequence of the mean value theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.370
<v Speaker 0>And another very important application is the fundamental theorem of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.970
<v Speaker 0>calculus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:28.090
<v Speaker 0>So these are modest and humble looking results.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,46,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 0>They can Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:36.230
<v Speaker 0>They are the building blocks of something more, um, maybe

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.550
<v Speaker 0>more impressive and more celebrated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98]}

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 0>Okay, nice.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 0>The next question is very short.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.750
<v Speaker 0>Is the following statement true or false?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.830
<v Speaker 0>The origin.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:53.030
<v Speaker 0>So the point x equals zero is an inflection point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.910
<v Speaker 0>of the function f of x equals x to the

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:57.510
<v Speaker 0>power of four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,54,84]}

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:04.070
<v Speaker 0>Um, well obviously to answer this question you have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.430
<v Speaker 0>remember what's the definition of an inflection point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.350
<v Speaker 0>Uh, where is that question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 0>Oh, here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 0>It's the first question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 0>So let me hide the results and let's vote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,94,86,100,100]}

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.300
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.900
<v Speaker 0>So, I mean, I don't know if you pay attention,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 0>but, you know, each question is supposed to, uh, investigate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100,63,100]}

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.660
<v Speaker 0>or, you know, eliminate one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,38,90]}

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.560
<v Speaker 0>One, uh, or let's say some application of the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.880
<v Speaker 0>And one of them is, uh, um, studying the behaviour

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,97]}

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.680
<v Speaker 0>of a function or sketching a graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.800
<v Speaker 0>So this is what we're doing in this question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so the orange is the origin, an inflection point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,88,100,100]}

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.080
<v Speaker 0>of this function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 0>Let's see how we voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:49.640
<v Speaker 0>Uh oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100]}

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.680
<v Speaker 0>That's pretty close.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:53.920
<v Speaker 0>Interesting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,98]}

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.960
<v Speaker 0>So, well, let's let's discuss this together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 0>As I said, you just have to recall the definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.560
<v Speaker 0>of an inflection point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.480
<v Speaker 0>What is an inflection point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:17.560
<v Speaker 0>An inflection point is a point where your function changes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.440
<v Speaker 0>concavity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:19.920
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.120
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:32.150
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so if if your function was, like concave up

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 0>at, at, uh, before arriving at the, at the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,96,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.110
<v Speaker 0>and then it changed into concave down, that would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 0>an inflection point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:47.990
<v Speaker 0>And concavity is determined by the sine of the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 0>derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:55.550
<v Speaker 0>So if you're a second derivative at the point were

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 0>to change the sine, then that point would be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.750
<v Speaker 0>inflection point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:08.630
<v Speaker 0>However, for this function, taking the second derivative gives you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 0>It gives you 12 x squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 0>12 x squared is positive everywhere except zero, so it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.410
<v Speaker 0>not really changing Uh, the sign.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,63,100,100]}

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:24.170
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.090
<v Speaker 0>So it's not an inflection point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.410
<v Speaker 0>And to illustrate this, let's look at a graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:35.690
<v Speaker 0>So this is what the graph looks like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 0>And indeed you can see that it's not changing concavity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.410
<v Speaker 0>at this point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.170
<v Speaker 0>So so this is f of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 0>And it's the concavity stays the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.570
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry I didn't show you the correct answer.

<v Speaker 0>The correct answer is false.

<v Speaker 0>Any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:21.210

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

<v Speaker 0>What's the time?

<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 0>We have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>We have some time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the next question is about limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 0>We need to find the limit of this function.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 0>And let me find that question for you here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.070
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's, let's let's calculate and vote.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.120
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.750
<v Speaker 0>So, um, fewer people have voted.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 0>Then I was hoping.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.550
<v Speaker 0>But it's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:21.110
<v Speaker 0>Let's discuss this question together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:26.710
<v Speaker 0>So obviously another very important application of derivatives is in

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.430
<v Speaker 0>evaluating limits.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:33.110
<v Speaker 0>And what's the result that helps us do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.710
<v Speaker 0>What did you use to answer this question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 0>Just you can just yell.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.870
<v Speaker 0>At us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:44.950
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 0>The thing is, I want you to, you know, obviously

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.190
<v Speaker 0>use all of these rules there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 0>That's why they are there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,49,49,100]}

00:45:52.710 --> 00:46:00.710
<v Speaker 0>But always, always think whether you can because sometimes you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 0>cannot apply those rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99]}

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 0>For example, L'Hopital's rule is, uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,91,91]}

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.930
<v Speaker 0>I didn't, I thought I copied the statement for you.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 0>But L'Hopital's rule has some requirements, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:23.570
<v Speaker 0>So the functions need to be differentiable at an open

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.570

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.730
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the point you're interested in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:34.090
<v Speaker 0>And lucky for us both a natural logarithm of x

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.850
<v Speaker 0>and this one obviously e to the power of x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:38.570
<v Speaker 0>minus e.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:43.970
<v Speaker 0>Both these functions are differentiable at the at an open

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:46.370
<v Speaker 0>interval containing the point one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:54.850
<v Speaker 0>And uh, if you plug in one, you will get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.170

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.890

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:11.050

<v Speaker 0>conditions that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 0>Indeed, you can use L'Hopital's rule because sometimes you can't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.710

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 0>breaks down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.430
<v Speaker 0>But I think, you know, just to be sure.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:16.970

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.010

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.850
<v Speaker 0>It's the same by L'Hopital's rule which we check that

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:26.770

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:35.770
