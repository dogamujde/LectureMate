<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.010
<v Speaker 0>So once again, I'll show you the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.090

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 0>Oh, that is better, isn't it?

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 0>I think that's better.

<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 0>Why does it say you cannot vote anymore?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 0>I don't understand that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Can you click on the link?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 0>Oh, uh, sorry about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 0>I did something which prevents you from voting, which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 0>really annoying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 0>I'm sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 0>Um, how about if I reset the whole thing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 0>Maybe that will help.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, but the.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100]}

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Problem is, we also saw the right answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.630

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, sorry about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100]}

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.470
<v Speaker 0>I don't know what's going on today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.230
<v Speaker 0>Uh, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100]}

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 0>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.580
<v Speaker 0>I am.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Speaker 0>I am confused here, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87]}

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Speaker 0>Sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.580
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.700
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.380
<v Speaker 0>Um, again, I only have one screen, so I will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.180
<v Speaker 0>have to switch this one to the visualiser.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90]}

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.860
<v Speaker 0>And what did we have there?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 0>We had the limit of.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.020
<v Speaker 0>SD goes to zero of one over t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.260
<v Speaker 0>Minus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 0>S t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,84]}

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.500
<v Speaker 0>So the question is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.680
<v Speaker 0>Is this limit equal to one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.880
<v Speaker 0>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Speaker 0>Let me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 0>So what do we do with, uh, expressions like these?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,62,100,100,95]}

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 0>So first of all, let's, uh, notice that naively plugging

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.920
<v Speaker 0>in zero doesn't quite work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.480
<v Speaker 0>You know, you could be tempted to say that each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.200
<v Speaker 0>of these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.280
<v Speaker 0>You can, uh, if you if I only had limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 0>of one over t s t goes to zero here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,94,94,100,100,100,87]}

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.920
<v Speaker 0>Um, uh, then you have a result in your book

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,76,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.280
<v Speaker 0>which says that this should be infinity, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 0>However, doing the same thing with the other fraction will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 0>also give you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 0>Infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Speaker 0>And then you're stuck with something like infinity minus infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.980
<v Speaker 0>Um, and that is something that you will soon learn

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 0>is called is it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Oh, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,61]}

<v Speaker 0>Thank you so much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 0>It's called an indeterminate form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.540
<v Speaker 0>So whatever you wanted to do, maybe we're tempted to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,80,100,100,100,89,100,100]}

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 0>do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 0>Doesn't quite work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.020
<v Speaker 0>But luckily, there's always another way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 0>Is it working now?

<v Speaker 0>Thank you so much.

<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't come on at the start.

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 0>It didn't come off, but.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,40]}

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.979
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, it's just it was just cooling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,52,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.020
<v Speaker 0>I tried to switch everything off and on, but it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.740
<v Speaker 0>still didn't work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 0>I had to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100]}

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Just use a remote, and it's overridden the cooling.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,52,100,100,60,100,100,100]}

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 0>Thank you so much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.340
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 0>Okay, now we have two screens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.650
<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.890
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but still, let's, uh, let's finish this question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39,100,100,100,80,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.850
<v Speaker 0>Actually, you know what?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 0>If we have two screens, why not use it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 0>So now you can see the the question on one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 0>of the screens and the solution on the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.370
<v Speaker 0>So as I said, this naive approach does not work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.490
<v Speaker 0>But what what does work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 0>Uh, the following principle, like in your, uh, in your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:45.730
<v Speaker 0>book, you have this, uh, approach of, um, using a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.310
<v Speaker 0>function which is, uh, which agrees with your function everywhere

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:57.710
<v Speaker 0>except the problematic point, and they should have the same

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.110
<v Speaker 0>limits at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.390
<v Speaker 0>So what does that imply for us?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 0>What it implies for us is that we can, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83]}

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 0>We can, uh, algebraically manipulate this expression, which is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.910
<v Speaker 0>fancy way of saying.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 0>Compute the this difference.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.950
<v Speaker 0>So, so what we need is to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 0>You can see everything, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 0>So I just do my regular, um, my regular, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.610
<v Speaker 0>manipulations with fractions Actions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 0>And what does this tell me?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.170
<v Speaker 0>It tells me that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 0>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.970
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so this is what I'm doing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 0>And what I'm using here is this principle that if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.530
<v Speaker 0>you're if you have two functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.970
<v Speaker 0>So I'm talking about this function and this function which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 0>agree everywhere except this problematic point t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 0>Sorry zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.370
<v Speaker 0>So I could only cancel t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.970
<v Speaker 0>With, with the condition that t is not zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.610
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 0>So these two agree everywhere except t equals zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 0>And then they still they should have the same limit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.550
<v Speaker 0>at t equals zero, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,97]}

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.030
<v Speaker 0>Uh, this is actually enough if it's, if it holds

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 0>on an open interval around zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.790
<v Speaker 0>But here it actually holds everywhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 0>So we're fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.750
<v Speaker 0>Well but this one now you can actually compute by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 0>direct substitution right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.950
<v Speaker 0>You can just put plug zero in here and you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.670
<v Speaker 0>get one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 0>So we had this expression right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.670
<v Speaker 0>And we realised that we cannot just naively plug in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.350
<v Speaker 0>zero because we get infinity minus infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.070
<v Speaker 0>Not good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.350
<v Speaker 0>But what we could do instead is to by some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.110
<v Speaker 0>algebraic manipulation, we could reduce it to a function which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.190
<v Speaker 0>agrees with our, uh, with the function we started with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.740
<v Speaker 0>everywhere Except zero, and that we can use that to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 0>deduce that they should have the same limit at zero,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 0>which is one.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.460
<v Speaker 0>Uh, sorry about the, uh, the, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,99,100,95]}

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.580
<v Speaker 0>Something went wrong with a woo club in the beginning.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,80,54,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 0>Hopefully the next attempt will be more successful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 0>And so something I'll do is I'll reset everything again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 0>And hopefully this will not mess up anything.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.220
<v Speaker 0>I think now this works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a couple of minutes to think about

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.260
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:09.890
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.330
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:17.690
<v Speaker 0>We have an overwhelming support for, uh, for falls.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:18.730
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.610
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.250
<v Speaker 0>You're right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.170
<v Speaker 0>Uh, but let's let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:24.890
<v Speaker 0>Why is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.170
<v Speaker 0>Why is that the case?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 0>Well, again, we do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.250
<v Speaker 0>Uh, how do we approach a question like this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.810
<v Speaker 0>Well, it kind of similarly to the previous one, but,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 0>uh, you know, there will be slight differences.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 0>So we have limit as x goes to minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.550
<v Speaker 0>of the expression x squared plus two x plus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.390
<v Speaker 0>and divided by x to the fourth minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,83,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 0>Oh sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 0>You don't see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.390
<v Speaker 0>Well what do we do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.470
<v Speaker 0>We again manipulate this algebraically.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 0>Into the following.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.510
<v Speaker 0>So we recognise hopefully that this is x plus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 0>squared divided by x to the fourth minus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.630
<v Speaker 0>But we can factorise that right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,83,100,100]}

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.510
<v Speaker 0>We can factorise that into the following expression which we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 0>can factorise further.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 0>there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.700
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.020
<v Speaker 0>Now.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:53.740 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 0>Well, you see again, plugging a minus one n on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,88,100]}

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 0>top would give us zero, and on the bottom would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.300
<v Speaker 0>also give us zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.780
<v Speaker 0>So we would just plug it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.940
<v Speaker 0>Well what was that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,100,100,93]}

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.500
<v Speaker 0>I don't know either.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.340
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.420
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 0>So we would, uh, we would obtain an expression of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.100
<v Speaker 0>the form zero divided by zero, which is yet another

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.620
<v Speaker 0>indeterminate form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.120
<v Speaker 0>But we don't do that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 0>We use this principle of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:51.440
<v Speaker 0>We used in the previous example that if expressions agree

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.440
<v Speaker 0>except one point on some open interval, then they will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.680
<v Speaker 0>have the same limit at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.360
<v Speaker 0>And that's, that means we can just, uh, we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,91,100,100,100,100,100,64,100,100]}

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.720
<v Speaker 0>just divide by x plus one, I divide by x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.520
<v Speaker 0>plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.240
<v Speaker 0>And what I get here well is a nice expression

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100]}

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.960
<v Speaker 0>no longer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 0>So there is no longer any nothing gives you zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.480
<v Speaker 0>in the denominator anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.360
<v Speaker 0>And we can just plug minus one in and compute

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 0>that will give us that will give us zero divided

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.340
<v Speaker 0>by something doesn't matter which is not infinity or zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 0>Well, that gives you zero, so it is indeed not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.740
<v Speaker 0>infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.620
<v Speaker 0>So you were correct about this question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100]}

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 0>So now we will switch to a slightly different kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 0>of question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 0>So I have to ask you, do you have any

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.700
<v Speaker 0>questions about this or the previous question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.900
<v Speaker 0>Because they used kind of a similar principle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.020
<v Speaker 0>And in the next question we will move on to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 0>something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.580
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this one or the previous

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.980
<v Speaker 0>one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.690
<v Speaker 0>Um, no, there are no questions and most of you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 0>chose the correct answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 0>So I will just, uh, I will move on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,45,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.090
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99]}

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 0>The we have a slight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.410
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.610
<v Speaker 0>No, it's all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100]}

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.970
<v Speaker 0>I can manage that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.570
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.810
<v Speaker 0>So, um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99]}

<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:23.010
<v Speaker 0>On the on one screen, you have a picture, right?

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 0>a little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.470
<v Speaker 0>There are some, uh, coloured circles and some not coloured

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.110

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 0>answer that question.

<v Speaker 0>I'll give you a couple of minutes here.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Take.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.360
<v Speaker 0>Um, okay, so, uh, not everyone has voted, but I

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 0>think voting has more or less stopped.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.120
<v Speaker 0>So I think it makes sense to discuss this question

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.800
<v Speaker 0>together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:07.840
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.160
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.880
<v Speaker 0>What is happening?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.120
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so first of all, let's look at the, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72]}

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.040
<v Speaker 0>the picture.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.600
<v Speaker 0>What is happening on the picture?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 0>Uh, you have some sort of function which kind of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,44,44]}

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 0>has a little jump or two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,51,99]}

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.100
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 0>And it's not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 0>It's not defined at point four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.700
<v Speaker 0>So just be be aware of the fact that when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.620
<v Speaker 0>you have that little circle which is not coloured in,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:01.260
<v Speaker 0>that means that you can stop the discussion for a

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.940
<v Speaker 0>moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 0>The discussion is for when we are answering the question.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 0>So those circles that are not coloured in, they.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 0>Are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.300
<v Speaker 0>Can you please be quiet?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79]}

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 0>That means that, uh, the the the the the function's

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.090
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 0>So what is this first thing here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:36.930
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:42.930
<v Speaker 0>Can you see this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is the limit of the function as x

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 0>Does everyone agree with that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:56.690
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 0>So?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.090
<v Speaker 0>So two is here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.810
<v Speaker 0>I approach two from the left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.130
<v Speaker 0>This limit exists, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.730
<v Speaker 0>This limit exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.450
<v Speaker 0>So everything's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100]}

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 0>What is this expression?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 0>Just somebody you can just shout.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.690
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 0>So it's the limit of this function as x approaches

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.550
<v Speaker 0>two from the right and it does exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.990
<v Speaker 0>Two right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,95]}

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.150
<v Speaker 0>Are those two limits equal?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 0>Indeed, they are not equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 0>And why was the so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96]}

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 0>I think that has something to do with uh with,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,39,100]}

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 0>with this uh, the third option.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41,77,100,100]}

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.270
<v Speaker 0>So the limit of the function as x approaches two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:09.110
<v Speaker 0>does not exist, as most of you correctly answered, because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 0>these two limits, as x approaches, two from the left

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.630
<v Speaker 0>and from the right are not equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 0>And finally, the, uh, the value of f at two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 0>Exists because, you know, despite the fact that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 0>an uncoloured circle here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,100,100,85]}

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 0>Kind of like an empty circle here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 0>We have a nice full circle up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.450
<v Speaker 0>And in fact, we would be in trouble if they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 0>were both coloured.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 0>And why would we be in trouble in that case?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.730
<v Speaker 0>So you see, what I'm referring to is that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:04.410
<v Speaker 0>have an empty circle here and a full, nicely filled

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.290
<v Speaker 0>in circle here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:12.650
<v Speaker 0>So why couldn't we have two fully coloured circles?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.450
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,97]}

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.570
<v Speaker 0>It would not be a function because it would have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 0>two values at two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 0>So then f at the point two would be one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.190
<v Speaker 0>and three at the same time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 0>We're not allowed to have this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.110
<v Speaker 0>If we are considering a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.870
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.550
<v Speaker 0>Are there any questions about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.150
<v Speaker 0>This assignment?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 0>No questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.870
<v Speaker 0>Let's move on to the next.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.990
<v Speaker 0>I think you will need a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:07.230
<v Speaker 0>So again we have a picture on this screen and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65,100,100]}

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.590
<v Speaker 0>the option and the question on the screen and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89,100,100,100,100,97,100,99,100]}

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 0>options on the screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.310
<v Speaker 0>I'll give you some time to think about it and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.830
<v Speaker 0>then we'll discuss it together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65]}

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:44.750
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so the voting is still kind of going on,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:49.830
<v Speaker 0>but it has slowed down, uh, slowed down, uh, sufficiently

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 0>so because we have, uh, we need to move on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.030
<v Speaker 0>to the other question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.190
<v Speaker 0>I will start discussing the answers with you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.590
<v Speaker 0>Uh, so these are the, uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 0>We had to select all the statements that are correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.910
<v Speaker 0>So let's analyse this together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.990
<v Speaker 0>Is this function continuous from the left at x equals

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.310
<v Speaker 0>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.170
<v Speaker 0>Most of you said yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.050
<v Speaker 0>Uh, why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,89]}

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.250
<v Speaker 0>Why is that true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,100,100,100]}

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 0>So in the previous question, we, uh, we, uh, discovered

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.890
<v Speaker 0>that the limit of this function as X approaches two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.770
<v Speaker 0>from the left existed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:43.730
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.930
<v Speaker 0>That's all we were interested in in that previous question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 0>We only wanted to know if the limit as X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 0>goes to sorry approaches two on the left exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.490
<v Speaker 0>Is that enough for continuity on the left at that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.010
<v Speaker 0>point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:08.730
<v Speaker 0>Is the existence of the limit from the left?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:12.210
<v Speaker 0>So as x approaches to on the left is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,75,100,100,71,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 0>existence of the limit at that point enough to claim

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 0>that the function is continuous at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.430
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.550
<v Speaker 0>You can just nod or shake your head.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 0>Do something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:29.550
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.910
<v Speaker 0>So we have a reluctant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:33.390
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 0>And indeed that's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.270
<v Speaker 0>What else do we need for continuity?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.950
<v Speaker 0>What else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.950
<v Speaker 0>What is missing?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.510
<v Speaker 0>Don't look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.870
<v Speaker 0>Not that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,79]}

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.550
<v Speaker 0>It's not missing in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:54.830
<v Speaker 0>But the question I asked was, is existence of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.830
<v Speaker 0>limit enough?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.910
<v Speaker 0>And we said no, because we need something else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 0>And what is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.550
<v Speaker 0>Something else?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 0>So it's not just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 0>It's not just enough that the limit exists at the

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.950

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.270

<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.580

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.940
<v Speaker 0>So the value of the function at that point is,

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.460

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.540
<v Speaker 0>It's three and the limit is three as well.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.660
<v Speaker 0>So we're good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.340
<v Speaker 0>So when we when we approach X from the left,

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.260

<v Speaker 0>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh, what about the second option when we approach two

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.180
<v Speaker 0>Does the limit exist there?

<v Speaker 0>The limit of the function as x approaches two from

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.820
<v Speaker 0>So the limit, not the value, but the limit of

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.500

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:23.400

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.000
<v Speaker 0>at that point, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91]}

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.000
<v Speaker 0>Because the value of the function at this point is

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.800

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:55.320
<v Speaker 0>Well, why is this function not continuous at the point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:55.640
<v Speaker 0>two?

<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92]}

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a gap.

<v Speaker 0>Yes, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.640
<v Speaker 0>So that's very good indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95]}

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:15.880
<v Speaker 0>Because or in other words, because the limits don't match

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.820

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.100
<v Speaker 0>So and for continuity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.660
<v Speaker 0>At that point, we would need those limits to match

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.820

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.820
<v Speaker 0>at that point.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.100
<v Speaker 0>Very good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.820
<v Speaker 0>So I can show you the, the the correct answer.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:56.420
<v Speaker 0>And we will have another question similar to these.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 0>Well you have to think about the continuity and let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.780
<v Speaker 0>start thinking about it and voting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.740
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll discuss it together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, so the voting has slowed down.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:49.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, it's still going on, but it's very slow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,78,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Speaker 0>So let's, uh, maybe let's let's start discussing this, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,88,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.450
<v Speaker 0>this question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 0>So most of you, uh, said false, uh, meaning the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:07.450

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.410
<v Speaker 0>Um, why why is that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,49]}

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 0>Why did you choose that answer anyone?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,88]}

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:16.190
<v Speaker 0>Just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.750
<v Speaker 0>You can just.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:17.510
<v Speaker 0>Yes, please.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:22.750
<v Speaker 0>Very good indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 0>Indeed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.670
<v Speaker 0>So the the the answer is because the function is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:31.910

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:32.830
<v Speaker 0>x equals four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,86]}

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:39.310
<v Speaker 0>So let's recall again for continuity we need two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.190
<v Speaker 0>Well two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 0>And one of those two things contains like a little

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.830
<v Speaker 0>sub thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,46]}

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:50.830
<v Speaker 0>So we need the limit at this point to exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 0>And moreover we need the limit at that point to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.790

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:07.110
<v Speaker 0>So the second condition requires the value of the function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 0>at that point to exist as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.510
<v Speaker 0>So we need two things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.420
<v Speaker 0>We need the limit to exist, and we need that

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 0>limit to match the value of the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.340
<v Speaker 0>But what if the function is not even defined at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 0>that point?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.780
<v Speaker 0>Which which is the case in this on this picture?

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 0>We don't know what this function is.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 0>And we don't care, because the graph tells us that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.980
<v Speaker 0>the function for some reason is not defined at that

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.380
<v Speaker 0>point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:44.580
<v Speaker 0>So we cannot even talk about continuity because, well, it's
