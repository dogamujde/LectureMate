00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 0>The practical calculator was based on logarithms, which we will

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.840
<v Speaker 0>People had these, which are tables of logarithms.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.920

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.000
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.680

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.120

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.280
<v Speaker 0>That's because this book was actually used.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.000

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,89]}

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.920
<v Speaker 0>So what is the calculator that they're arguing about?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 0>Um.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.040
<v Speaker 0>It's this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 0>This is the calculator they're arguing about.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.420

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.420
<v Speaker 0>It's called a slide rule, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.820
<v Speaker 0>And it's based on logarithms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.780
<v Speaker 0>So this is a C last, last century when I

<v Speaker 0>started teaching.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 0>Um, we did have computers, but we didn't have beam

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 0>projectors like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 0>So we had to have things you could see at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 0>the back of the lecture theatre.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 0>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.660
<v Speaker 0>So how does this work?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.540
<v Speaker 0>So, you know, when you add logarithms, you multiply numbers,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 0>So this distance along.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 0>This is why I need you to hold it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.500
<v Speaker 0>This distance along here is the logarithm of two.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 0>And this distance along here is the logarithm of three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.220
<v Speaker 0>And when you multiply two by three you get six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 0>And when you multiply four by two, you get eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 0>And when you multiply five by two, you get ten.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 0>And when you multiply six by two, you can't do

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.530
<v Speaker 0>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.090
<v Speaker 0>So we have to come back this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:07.610
<v Speaker 0>And six by two is 12 two 7 to 14

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.570
<v Speaker 0>1618.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.010
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 0>Let's do three times table shall we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100]}

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.330
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 0>So that's the logarithm of three, three, three and nine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.010
<v Speaker 0>Blah blah blah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 0>That's how you know, when you add logarithms you multiply

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 0>the number, don't you?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 0>So this calculator and I've got my father.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,65]}

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.250
<v Speaker 0>He used this as an engineer last century.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,95]}

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.210

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.850
<v Speaker 0>I could rattle on about this for a whole hour,

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.690

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 0>Agreed.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.600
<v Speaker 0>So how are we going to differentiate that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.840
<v Speaker 0>Well we're going to have to do a chain rule

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 0>thing aren't we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.240
<v Speaker 0>So the derivative of arctan of q of x would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 0>be the derivative of q of x divided by q

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.440
<v Speaker 0>squared plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.240
<v Speaker 0>That's that's the that's the chain rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.800
<v Speaker 0>And now we want to differentiate this quotient.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 0>So when we differentiate those things and put them together

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.120
<v Speaker 0>we get this expression here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 0>And we've got horrible fractions within fractions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.020
<v Speaker 0>So I'm just going to rationally simplify all that away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.460
<v Speaker 0>And what do I get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.180
<v Speaker 0>Oh I get back to one over one plus x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 0>squared.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.140
<v Speaker 0>So what's going on with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.500
<v Speaker 0>The derivative of this is the same as the derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.860
<v Speaker 0>of the arctan function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 0>Now Descartes's principal contribution to all of mathematics was to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,58,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.060
<v Speaker 0>link algebra and geometry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.819
<v Speaker 0>And in the 20th century we mostly concentrate on algebra

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.300
<v Speaker 0>which then becomes calculus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.060
<v Speaker 0>So we do a lot of stuff symbolically, but it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.220
<v Speaker 0>really important not to lose track of those, um, geometric

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,52,100]}

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 0>roots.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.940
<v Speaker 0>So let's sketch the arctan function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.780
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.060
<v Speaker 0>And then let's sketch that function that I just had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 0>arctan of three x plus one over three minus x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.880
<v Speaker 0>You know we've got this division by zero here, haven't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 0>we?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 0>Which is always bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.160
<v Speaker 0>So it's not surprising that at x equals three something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100,100]}

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 0>happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.240
<v Speaker 0>And if we then just look at the tangents by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 0>putting points on the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.400
<v Speaker 0>We can see that those tangents are always parallel even

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.160
<v Speaker 0>if the functions are not exactly one constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.600
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 0>Because of this discontinuity, school mathematics by and large doesn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 0>put in all the technical detail.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,85]}

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.520
<v Speaker 0>We're going to look at calculus again because sometimes this

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.800
<v Speaker 0>technical detail really matters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 0>A function is more than just the rule.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.560
<v Speaker 0>It's the range and domain, which is exactly the subject

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92]}

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 0>And examples like this can be generalised, right?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.220
<v Speaker 0>We can move that discontinuity elsewhere and still have the

<v Speaker 1>It's just to point your attention on the things that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>are important in the chapter that you should have read

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.350
<v Speaker 1>for the week.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you just bear it with me for one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:13.350
<v Speaker 1>second, I will bring up the questions and well, okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91,100]}

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So why is my question slowed?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I seem to not be able to talk to Chrome

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Today we are going to look at functions and graphs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.610
<v Speaker 1>So as Chris said, these are all things you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.810
<v Speaker 1>been looking at since you were probably 16.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>But there are so many more things that we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.010
<v Speaker 1>to be careful about when we do this at a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 1>more advanced level.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 1>So today is just really a refreshing, refreshing lecture to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>see what we mean by a function and how.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,93]}

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.210
<v Speaker 1>What is the relationship between the algebraic version and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.210
<v Speaker 1>graph version?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.130
<v Speaker 1>What is the domain and the codomain?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So um, so let me see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh, maybe that works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh, I'm not sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,93]}

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry, guys.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I just need to convince my Chrom that I'm not

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.190
<v Speaker 1>a robot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking for bicycles in my, uh, in my

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.110
<v Speaker 1>screen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh, man.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,95]}

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so what do we want to say about functions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and graphs today?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Speaker 1>The only two things really, that I think are really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.700
<v Speaker 1>important in, in this kind of distribution about functional graphs

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,77,77,100,100,39,100]}

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.020
<v Speaker 1>is to think about what is the definition of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.500
<v Speaker 1>function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Not everything is a function word.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,28]}

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.460
<v Speaker 1>See, something is to talk about the domain and a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Speaker 1>range of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,96]}

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.060
<v Speaker 1>So being able to calculate domain and range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 1>The reason why it is important to be able to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.580
<v Speaker 1>do that is that there are things that we will

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.100
<v Speaker 1>be able to do only if the two functions that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.080
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about share, for example, at least in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>part, they range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100]}

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And then we want to talk very quickly about y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,89]}

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 1>intercept.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80]}

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,97]}

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll see whether we have time for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>The thing I want to draw your attention to is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that all these things you see on the board, they

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58]}

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 1>are all the same mathematical objects, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,99]}

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.720
<v Speaker 1>There are all different ways of thinking about functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.960
<v Speaker 1>We have the algebraic representation which is x plus one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040
<v Speaker 1>We have the graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 1>We have the set of ordered pairs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That is a way of thinking about function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,96]}

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.760
<v Speaker 1>That tells me that this is the set of elements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And in this set that is the point minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.920
<v Speaker 1>zero, the .01.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100]}

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>And we talk about ordered pairs, because of course it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>is important to know which one is the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Speaker 1>The first one represent the x coordinate and the second

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,62,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.280
<v Speaker 1>one represents the y coordinate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,52]}

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>It is very important that you learn how to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.740
<v Speaker 1>from one representation to the other, not just for the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 1>idea of functions, but a lot of the mathematical objects

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 1>that we will see in carp are represented by different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.220
<v Speaker 1>weights.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's then important to be able to go from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.180
<v Speaker 1>one to the other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:55.420
<v Speaker 1>So because I know that this system doesn't this wow,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,21,100]}

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.140
<v Speaker 1>look at that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that this system doesn't display picture particularly

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the text of the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 1>And I know that a lot of you are already

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.500
<v Speaker 1>responding.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Can you please carry on responding?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I have only 69.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a really good exercise to go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.620
<v Speaker 1>through these questions in class.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that there are more than 144

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.000
<v Speaker 1>people in this room.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so what do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So I think we can kind of look at this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.040
<v Speaker 1>question quite quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 1>The great majority of people have voted for Falz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,22]}

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.240
<v Speaker 1>This is not a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.720
<v Speaker 1>So we know that not everything is a function, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.150
<v Speaker 1>So in this case, for each of the x on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the x axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I have the correspondence of two wise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:41.030
<v Speaker 1>We call this the vertical texts test sometimes, and it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,57,93,100,100,100]}

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.430
<v Speaker 1>something that is useful to have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So in my solution for this question I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.030

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Speaker 1>So who is that object.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the circle right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,68,100,100]}

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the equation of the circle in that shape.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The the equation of the circle is not a function.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So if I want to write it in an explicit

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.830
<v Speaker 1>way for the y, I would write it that way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And I can observe that each one of that two

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.070
<v Speaker 1>functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 1>So these were equal to objects in plus or minus

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.270
<v Speaker 1>something.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So each one of that is a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But together they are not because each one of that

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.590

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.890
<v Speaker 1>So this is quite important we need to think about

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.610
<v Speaker 1>when we look at objects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>But that these functions are not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,67,100,100,56,96]}

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.890
<v Speaker 1>In this case, it was very easy.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.690

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.530
<v Speaker 1>will maybe be more complicated cases.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.290

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.090

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.010

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.370

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:23.290

<v Speaker 1>Somebody can.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.750

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.870

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.830

<v Speaker 1>Exactly, exactly.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.470

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.270
<v Speaker 1>In this case, the square root can give us some

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.430

<v Speaker 1>or in calculus, we don't really talk to complex numbers.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.070

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.150

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good number to be a subject of a square

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>root.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So in my in the solution of my, um, on

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.340
<v Speaker 1>my question, I want to say yes.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to make sure?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I need to make sure that the item x plus

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.340
<v Speaker 1>two under the square root is positive or zero, right?

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And this means that this is what I'm looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Be careful because this can vary.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>So for example you need to you need to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.780
<v Speaker 1>about that when you have a denominator.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So if I had one over x plus two then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 1>obviously minus two would not be in the domain of

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.260
<v Speaker 1>that function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Because for a fraction that's not acceptable to have zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So once when you have you are required to look

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.420
<v Speaker 1>at the At domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,71,90,100]}

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.940
<v Speaker 1>You really need to think about what are the elements

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in expressing that function and think where

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.180
<v Speaker 1>these elements may not be defined.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.940
<v Speaker 1>In this case, square root is not defined in negative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,71,100]}

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.700
<v Speaker 1>numbers, but it's perfectly okay on zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,66,100,100,51,100]}

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we are all kind of happy

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.780
<v Speaker 1>with the domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It's something quite that we can we can think about.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 1>But I want to bring your attention now on the

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:32.920

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.440
<v Speaker 1>What is the range of function?

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,81,100]}

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.680

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And then I will be asking, um, what do we

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.160

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.640
<v Speaker 1>How do how do we find it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Is this the range?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>This is the main.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,71]}

<v Unknown>Yeah.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.159
<v Speaker 4>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Y y is just f equal to f of x

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,91,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 4>by convention.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh, gosh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Lots of words.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,90,83]}

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.419
<v Unknown>I think one of the definitions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,99,52,52]}

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:49.899
<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.659
<v Unknown>I think there is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,36,30,82]}

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.820
<v Unknown>I think it's eight I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,77,92,92]}

00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Unknown>Oh, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100]}

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.260
<v Unknown>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.000
<v Unknown>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Still a few boats coming in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,37,100,100]}

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.920
<v Speaker 1>This is very exciting.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100]}

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So before we, um, we reveal the answer, there seems

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,97,71,71,81,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 1>to be quite a lot of consensus about it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100,100]}

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody that wants to volunteer a definition of

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 1>range?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.400
<v Speaker 1>So for the domain, we say that the domain is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.320
<v Speaker 1>basically the subset where the function exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 1>So we see in the four square roots we don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,93,90,100,65,99,98,100,100]}

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.560
<v Speaker 1>want it negative and all this kind of stuff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But what is the range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.360
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.120
<v Speaker 1>The set of all possible outputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.840
<v Speaker 1>So think about domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about x axis Success and range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.150
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,90]}

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about y axis.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay, so you need to have, um, rules.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87,100]}

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Not rules, but restriction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm looking for on both axes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 1>So why do we think that's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And how do we calculate the range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:47.510
<v Speaker 1>So when we think about calculating the range of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 1>function, we need to ask ourselves the question for what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:56.630
<v Speaker 1>value of x I can find that y such that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,63,100,100,100]}

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is the set of all the outputs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So in my case I say okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:09.230
<v Speaker 1>The range of this function is contained between minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Why is that the case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Because the domain we have seen what it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100]}

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 1>The square root can be the smallest number of that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 1>square root is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.330
<v Speaker 1>So the range will have to be Between minus one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 1>But we cannot just stop at that point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.850
<v Speaker 1>We need to check that for each y in that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:31.290
<v Speaker 1>set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.570
<v Speaker 1>There exists an X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,100,100]}

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.610
<v Speaker 1>So we need to check basically that if I take

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.250
<v Speaker 1>y greater or equal than minus one, there is an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.490
<v Speaker 1>x such that f of x is equal to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And we do this in this case by squaring both

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.730
<v Speaker 1>sides because we have a square root.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 1>So obviously it's not pleasant to do calculation with square

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100,100]}

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 1>roots.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So the yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,51,70]}

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.930
<v Speaker 3>What is the purpose behind using a square bracket on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.170
<v Speaker 3>the left and a regular bracket on the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.690
<v Speaker 1>In minus one zero where.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97]}

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So that is notation minus the square bracket means that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the point minus one is part of that set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Obviously infinity is not a number so it cannot be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.930
<v Speaker 1>part of the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So remember this notation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for the question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh, talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,41]}

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.510
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>This notation means that both the real numbers A and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.150
<v Speaker 1>B are inside the set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So if I were two to write this, this would

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>be the number a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.070
<v Speaker 1>This would be the number B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,99,100,93]}

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 1>My set is all the numbers between A and b

<v Speaker 1>included a and b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 1>We have seen in the.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.870
<v Speaker 1>When we calculated the domain or the function that we

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.550

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 1>to the round bracket means that these points are not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.350
<v Speaker 1>included.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.070
<v Speaker 1>So if I had, say the function one x plus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 1>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, the number minus two is not part of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.310
<v Speaker 1>range of this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So what is the range of this function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 5>From minus minus infinity to plus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Not including two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99]}

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 1>So I would write the range of this function in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,88,97,100,100,100]}

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:28.810
<v Speaker 1>this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Apology for my.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100]}

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.370
<v Speaker 1>So this is the union of the sets minus infinity

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.330
<v Speaker 1>two I throw away the number two because that's not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,91]}

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 1>good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That makes my denominator of zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,83,100]}

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And then two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is a standard notation we use when we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.970
<v Speaker 1>when we write sets okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100]}

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So the range of this function is the first one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.570
<v Speaker 1>is a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.130
<v Speaker 1>At the next quiz.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:07.410
<v Speaker 1>This.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay one one minute to do this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.690
<v Speaker 1>What is the y intercept.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh, why is that still displaying that weight?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,76]}

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh, no, it's the red one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,61,100]}

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.600
<v Speaker 1>It's the y intercept.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100]}

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Got confused.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86]}

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So how do I calculate y intercept?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,87]}

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.960
<v Speaker 1>What is the y intercept?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Somebody can volunteer me an answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 1>No volunteers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,100]}

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So what is the y intercept?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.700
<v Speaker 1>In general is the value of y when x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.500
<v Speaker 1>equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And we'll call it a y intercept because it's a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,74,100,100,90,100,100,100,60,76]}

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 1>value that the function takes when x is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 1>zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.860
<v Speaker 1>So I think that at that point is quite easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.620
<v Speaker 1>One more notation confusion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>In this case this notation represents what.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 1>In that case up on the board.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Sorry it's a point right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94]}

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I can I can Indicate points on the Cartesian plane

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.800
<v Speaker 1>by ordered pairs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.840
<v Speaker 1>So this is the point a.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Whilst this notation here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,100,100,100]}

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Refers to a segment on the on the real line.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And this is why we really need to be precise

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.960
<v Speaker 1>when we write mathematics, because occasionally we may get confused.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.520
<v Speaker 1>When we have points, we usually call them a capital

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,73,100]}

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 1>letters a equal minus one zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>And what we have segments usually we call them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 1>We give them small letters names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And this is why it's important to be precise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.920
<v Speaker 1>So when you do your homework or you write your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.080
<v Speaker 1>mathematics or you write your assignment, don't forget to name

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.240
<v Speaker 1>your mathematical objects, okay?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,62]}

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So you give them names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,40,100,100,100]}

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Letters?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily names.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95,100]}

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.540
<v Speaker 1>But in this case, this is how.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.020
<v Speaker 1>This is the y intercept.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I think we have just time to do one more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Now this is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 1>This is when things come together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,75,100,100,100]}

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Now let's give it three minutes, because then we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 1>to go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:20.400
<v Speaker 2>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[30]}

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Know?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[30]}

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,91]}

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.030
<v Unknown>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:30.470
<v Unknown>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:35.950
<v Unknown>My God.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,71]}

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay, again, a lot of agreement on this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Why did I say that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 1>These exercises of this type is where everything comes together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Can I do the composition of any two functions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So can I just take two random functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And I will be able to write the composite function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that true or false?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So what about if I'm trying to compose two functions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.790
<v Speaker 1>where one exists only where the other one doesn't?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,75,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't have an output.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So we can't just go in and do the composition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 1>of function by kind of doing the mechanical thing, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>we will see in a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.570
<v Speaker 1>We really need to think about where this function exists.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.370
<v Speaker 1>How do they behave to the shared range domain and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,43,54,52,100,100,100]}

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:26.250
<v Speaker 1>all this kind of stuff?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Hence the picture on the board.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So how do we go around doing exercises of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:33.130
<v Speaker 1>sort.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And this is also a little bit of a difference

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60,48,100]}

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.290
<v Speaker 1>that Chris was talking about before right I guess.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Well, I guess when I was in school, in school

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle Ages, we would just go in and

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.850
<v Speaker 1>put the, you know, the number in and calculate.

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And then we were all happy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,76,60,54,100]}

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.650
<v Speaker 1>This is not what we're doing here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.690
<v Speaker 1>We need to think a little bit more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.290
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that the domain of both functions

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 1>is minus infinity to plus infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Do we agree with that?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.970
<v Speaker 1>What are my function?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,98,98]}

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I can see them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,90]}

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, sure, I think so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,70,100,100,100]}

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:09.530
<v Speaker 1>No one is a polynomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.150
<v Speaker 1>The other one is a Standard mod function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,65,84]}

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,89,98]}

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.870
<v Speaker 1>So that is not troublesome.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,87,100]}

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I need to check what happened with range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:27.110
<v Speaker 1>So if the domain name is infinity plus infinity the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100,73,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.350
<v Speaker 1>range will be a subset of that domain.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 1>And then we do the calculation from before we need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.270
<v Speaker 1>to find a g of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 1>That gives me the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So we need to make sure what is that y

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100,67,100,51,92]}

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.430
<v Speaker 1>exists from that function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So what is the range of the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And do the calculation I did before I need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 1>find an x such that y g of x is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:55.710
<v Speaker 1>equal to that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And in this case I get that the range of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.470
<v Speaker 1>g is -17 over four infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Can you see it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.830
<v Speaker 1>In that case again -17 over four is taken.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously infinity is not because it's not the number once

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,97,100,56,100,100]}

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I've gone in and I checked the domain in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,63,63]}

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 1>range.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.330
<v Speaker 1>So the shared subset which is the range and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,69,100,100,100,52,100,100,100]}

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>shared subset which is the domain, then I can go

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.610
<v Speaker 1>on into the calculation, which is the calculation we know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,41,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 1>from school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And in order to do this calculation we know this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.210
<v Speaker 1>is all pretty straightforward.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.130
<v Speaker 1>We just compose it to function and we find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,84,50,70,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.010
<v Speaker 1>function in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.810
<v Speaker 1>In the last in the last item.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:44.530
<v Speaker 1>So this is just this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90]}

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.770
<v Speaker 1>This is just like an encouragement for you to think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.570
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more about the mathematics that you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.330
<v Speaker 1>seen in school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have seen all these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.330
<v Speaker 1>This is the calculation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So when we when we will be asking you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:03.570
<v Speaker 1>do exercises of the type, for example, of, of calculating

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.650
<v Speaker 1>the composition of a function, it will not be enough

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that you tell me or you put this instead of

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the x and that's the results you get out.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 1>So you really need to be precise and you really

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.080
<v Speaker 1>need to be careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.360
<v Speaker 1>You know who are dysfunction?

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.800
<v Speaker 1>the composite function?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.640
<v Speaker 1>In our case, that's what we got okay.

<v Speaker 5>Sure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71]}

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.100

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.060
