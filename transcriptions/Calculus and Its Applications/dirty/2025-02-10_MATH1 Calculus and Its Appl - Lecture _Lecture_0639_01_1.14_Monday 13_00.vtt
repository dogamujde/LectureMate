WEBVTT

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 0>Good afternoon and welcome to week five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 0>Can't believe it's already nearly halfway through the semester.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 0>Are you all right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,83,100]}

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so today we are going to talk about integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 0>Um, just for a very quick show of hands.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 0>Oh my God.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 0>How many people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,91]}

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 0>How many of you know what is an integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 0>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73]}

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 0>So nobody else.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100]}

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 0>So today we just give a quick introduction to what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 0>are integrals and what are properties of integrals?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 0>We as usual, we will have a couple of slides

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 0>with things which are important in the chapter that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 0>have read.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 0>But please remember that this is not going to cover

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 0>the material of the chapter, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 0>These are just 3 or 4 points which I think

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 0>that are important to remember.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 0>And I know the students sometimes, sometimes don't think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 0>when they do exercises with integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 0>And then we will do our quizzes as usual.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 0>The first thing that was so the integrals came about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 0>because in some sense mathematicians want wanted to calculate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,70,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 0>area between a curve and the x axis limited by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 0>two points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69]}

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 0>So this was an approximation idea that there were no

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,54,100,100,100]}

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 0>kind of ways of thinking about this before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 0>And some mathematicians talk.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,76,100,74]}

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 0>Okay, what about if I use an approximation method?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 0>You will have seen in your book that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 0>approximate some area from the bottom and from the top,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,55,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 0>so overshooting and undershooting and then the limit is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 0>integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 0>In the next lecture on Thursday we will see one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 0>of these approximation methods that were used, which is the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 0>Riemann sums, which is exactly what it does.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100]}

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 0>But this is how integrals came about.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 0>Um, integrals are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100]}

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 0>A linear operator just as much as the derivative is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 0>What does it mean that they are linear operator work

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,35]}

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 0>that these two properties hold so that the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 0>integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 0>So the integral of a sum is the sum of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.680
<v Speaker 0>the integrals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 0>And if I have a constant time, the integral of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 0>a constant time function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100]}

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 0>The integral of these functions is the constant time the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,72,76,100,100,100,94,100]}

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 0>integral of the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 0>So this is what it means to be a linear

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 0>operator, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94]}

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 0>So in mathematics we think about this saying that it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 0>behave nicely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[36,100]}

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.460
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't do anything strange that we would not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 0>want it to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.860
<v Speaker 0>So when we talk about integral we distinguish between definite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,67,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 0>integral and indefinite integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 0>So definite integral is the integral of a function between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.820
<v Speaker 0>two given points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 0>I've called them a and b here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,47,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 0>So an indefinite integral is an integral of a function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.460
<v Speaker 0>but not really defined in in which point.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 0>The thing that sometimes students don't think about is that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 0>when I calculate an indefinite integral, the outcome of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 0>calculation of the actual integral of the function is not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 0>complete if I don't add the constant of integration.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100]}

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.420
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 0>I'm asking this question just in case somebody wanted to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,86,100]}

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Speaker 0>answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45]}

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, you're.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100]}

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Essentially, you're solving for a certain function, but there's whole

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.320
<v Speaker 1>family functions that would, uh, make this relationship we're given.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,82,100]}

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>True.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And so the unspecified constant is a way of, uh,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.760
<v Speaker 1>notating this entire family of functions, whereas missing off one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,100]}

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 1>only gives a single function when there's more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.440
<v Speaker 0>So what is the idea?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 0>Think about the definite integral for a minute.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 0>The definite integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,84,100]}

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.560
<v Speaker 0>You solve the integral, and then you actually go and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.680
<v Speaker 0>calculate the area under the curve between the two points

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 0>which are given, which are RMB.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,52]}

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 0>If you calculate the indefinite integral that still is trying

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 0>to give you the area between two points, but the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.280
<v Speaker 0>points are not specified.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 0>So as your colleague was saying, there is whole family

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,73,77]}

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 0>of functions that could give you the area under the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 0>curve given two points where the curve is defined.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.140
<v Speaker 0>And this is why we put a concept of integration

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 0>T to indicate that that is a family of functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[41,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 0>What is the outcome of a definite integral?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 0>What kind of mathematical object is the outcome of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100
<v Speaker 0>definite integral?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.380
<v Speaker 0>No takers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

<v Speaker 2>Bye bye.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.500
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.380
<v Speaker 0>Why do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 0>Actually, let me grab the other mic.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.540
<v Speaker 0>Why do we think that that is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>That.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.260
<v Speaker 0>Somebody could have voted for true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 0>Tell me what they think is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Because it's just the sum of all of the different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Uh, it's a sum of in pieces, and the strings

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,63]}

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 3>been chopped into pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.040
<v Speaker 3>So the whole sum is the whole string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.640
<v Speaker 0>So the mike wasn't great, but this is exactly the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 0>right answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 0>So I've chopped my string in n pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 0>So obviously the sum of these pieces will be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,52,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.880
<v Speaker 0>length of the string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.160
<v Speaker 0>So if I want to formalise this a little bit

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 0>by trying to use some of the appropriate mathematical language,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.680
<v Speaker 0>I would, I would say it it this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,50,100,100,100]}

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.960
<v Speaker 0>So that is my very poor representation of a piece

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.000
<v Speaker 0>of string, I'm afraid, on the left hand side.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 0>But on the right hand side, what do I say?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.800
<v Speaker 0>Well, this is an interval that goes from x0 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.520
<v Speaker 0>x n and that length which is x n minus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,60,100,100,100,100,100,91,84,100]}

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.120
<v Speaker 0>x0.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.120
<v Speaker 0>Because we know how to calculate the length of segment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 0>is exactly the sum of all the n pieces of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.080
<v Speaker 0>string I've chopped my string in.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 0>So if you look, if you think for a moment

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 0>about what that sum looks like, if you had to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,89,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.180
<v Speaker 0>unpack all this delta x one, delta x two and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.420
<v Speaker 0>so on, you will find that at the end you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,46,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 0>are left with the way that we know.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,88,100,100,100,100]}

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.380
<v Speaker 0>We calculate the length of a string which is x

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 0>n by minus x zero okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,54,54,89]}

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.580
<v Speaker 0>So this is like a first if you like thinking

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.260

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 0>into intervals and then seeing how we how we can

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 0>do the sum.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98]}

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.940
<v Speaker 0>Of course, in the case of a string.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 0>I don't need to do any approximation.

<v Speaker 2>You.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84,84]}

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,51]}

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's have a think about our options here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.280
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 0>So why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85]}

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 0>Um, so somebody that voted for the first option.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.960
<v Speaker 0>So the first option, say it doesn't really matter how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.960
<v Speaker 0>many sectors are the circle into somebody that said that

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 0>that question is right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 0>Can they tell me why they thought it was right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,82,52,100,100]}

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,77,75,62]}

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.620
<v Speaker 0>There is a lot more people in this room than

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 0>the 8% who voted that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87]}

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 0>That is right, because there is a lot of people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Speaker 0>that voted for all the possibilities to be correct.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.780
<v Speaker 0>So why is that right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 2>There are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,77]}

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.339
<v Speaker 0>No takers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.579
<v Speaker 4>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Um, it's kind of the same thing as before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.339
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.900
<v Speaker 3>The equation that's given just does give the area off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,51]}

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.020
<v Speaker 3>So if you add all of the sectors together, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.260
<v Speaker 3>get the area of the circle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not really like an approximation thing where you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.460
<v Speaker 3>to say that, um, it's the limit of an infinity,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,58,81]}

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 3>but also b and C mean the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,89,94,93,100,100,100]}

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.160
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so what did we say here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 0>Obviously the first question is correct because it's exactly the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 0>same exercise that we did before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.640
<v Speaker 0>But this time I'm looking at cutting into bits an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.920
<v Speaker 0>angle rather than a piece of string.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.520
<v Speaker 0>So it doesn't really matter how many pieces I cut

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.960
<v Speaker 0>this angle into the An will be.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,100]}

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.840
<v Speaker 0>Will be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.760
<v Speaker 0>So basically that question is telling me that the the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,58,100]}

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.200
<v Speaker 0>measure of that angle doesn't change.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.680
<v Speaker 0>If I cut it in 10 in 10 angles or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,83,83,83,100,100]}

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.520
<v Speaker 0>20 angles or 30 angles, it's the same, exactly the

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.880
<v Speaker 0>same thing that we said before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 0>What about the second one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.800
<v Speaker 0>What do we think about the second one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 0>Why is the second one correct?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.160
<v Speaker 0>Anybody wants to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.660
<v Speaker 4>Sure what to say.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,100,100]}

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 0>So what do we need?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 0>What do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.140
<v Speaker 0>That's correct.

<v Speaker 0>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.260
<v Speaker 4>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.380
<v Speaker 5>Um, if we know that, um, that that's true for

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.980
<v Speaker 5>all n, then it's the limit will also still be

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 5>equal.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:14.900
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.460
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 0>So if I think in terms of, um, I don't

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.580
<v Speaker 0>know how to say it of iteration of the technique

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 0>I had before.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 0>I have ten, um, ten sectors, 26 or 30 sectors.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 0>Whatever I go, I can go as far as I

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:30.980
<v Speaker 0>want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.140
<v Speaker 0>That will be the limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 0>And what is three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.280
<v Speaker 0>What is the third bit?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86]}

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.360
<v Speaker 0>The third answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97]}

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.840
<v Speaker 0>Well, you have it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.440
<v Speaker 0>You have it there, right?

<v Speaker 0>Who is that thumb?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,51]}

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.750
<v Speaker 0>I can write it as the integral between 0 and

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.640
<v Speaker 0>So the third one is also correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.800
<v Speaker 0>So the correct answer was that these are all different

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.800

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.480
<v Speaker 0>approximation, apart from the fact that, as your colleague said

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.640

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 0>this case, we have a formula to calculate these measures

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.960

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 0>In sum of sectors, I can express them as a

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 0>limit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.340
<v Speaker 0>I can express them as an integral.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.180
<v Speaker 0>This is all the same measure.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.220
<v Speaker 0>It is measuring always the same object and so all

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.420
<v Speaker 0>the outcomes are the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

<v Speaker 0>It would be sad if I was measuring the same

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.960
<v Speaker 0>So what do we think about this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.960
<v Speaker 0>So you got it right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.840
<v Speaker 0>Why did you think that this is sometimes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:57.960
<v Speaker 0>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.760
<v Speaker 3>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 6>Come on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 6>Um, so when you when you integrate a differentiable function,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 6>it becomes the function before it got differentiated or integrated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,96]}

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.000
<v Speaker 6>Um, so it would be f of t.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,89,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.920
<v Speaker 6>And I thought if it's saying it's equal to f

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 6>of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 6>And that would only be true if the x was

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.760
<v Speaker 6>the same as the T, or if both of them

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.440
<v Speaker 6>were zero or f or zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 6>Um, which would be sometimes, uh, yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.200
<v Speaker 0>That's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.760
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 0>So what's happening here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.970
<v Speaker 0>This is definitely not always true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.490
<v Speaker 0>But I can show you at least one case in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.290
<v Speaker 0>which it is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,66,100,100]}

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 0>So it's not always wrong either.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.850
<v Speaker 0>What is that happens here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.610
<v Speaker 0>So I'm trying to integrate this function missing in zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100,100,100,100,100,89,82,100]}

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.090
<v Speaker 0>and x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:50.290
<v Speaker 0>So what mathematical objects do I expect to have from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 0>an integration between zero and x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 0>So you've calculated this integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,52,100,100,100]}

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.050
<v Speaker 0>What do you get.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100]}

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 0>Well you can see that right as a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,87,100,68,100,100]}

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.010
<v Speaker 0>So even if we say that when I calculate the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 0>integral, the definite integral that the outcome is usually a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,69,100,100,100,100,40]}

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.730
<v Speaker 0>number, it was a number in the example I showed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,58,100,100,100,92,100,100]}

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 0>you before.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.970
<v Speaker 0>But I could replace one of the extremes of integration

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,81,97,100]}

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.250
<v Speaker 0>with the variable, and in that case I would obtain

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.290
<v Speaker 0>a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.350
<v Speaker 0>In this particular case, I just want to understand when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100]}

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 0>this function is equal of f of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100]}

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.950
<v Speaker 0>And of course this is only true if f of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.110
<v Speaker 0>zero is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 0>So be careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.150
<v Speaker 0>This is like a little bit of a logic point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,86,100,100,100,100,100,61,100,100]}

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 0>here sometimes for the right question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,73,100,100,100]}

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 0>Because this is not always true, because f of zero

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 0>could be any other number, in which case it wouldn't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.190
<v Speaker 0>be f of x and is true sometimes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 0>So it's not never true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,72,100,100,100]}

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.670
<v Speaker 0>Be careful when you do quizzes and think about, well,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,79]}

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.190
<v Speaker 0>actually the things that you are that you are asked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,92,68,98,94,94,100]}

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.790
<v Speaker 0>to do mean so never would mean never, so that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,50]}

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.430
<v Speaker 0>you cannot produce a case for which this is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.350
<v Speaker 0>Once I've shown you a case for which this is

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.430
<v Speaker 0>true, okay, let's do one more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:33.730
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.250
<v Speaker 2>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:52.930
<v Speaker 2>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52]}

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.170
<v Speaker 2>The reason.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,91]}

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Why I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,28]}

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

<v Speaker 2>My God.

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58]}

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Forgot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51]}

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.490
<v Speaker 0>Okay, this is a nice question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:28.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.970
<v Speaker 0>Requires two minutes of thinking.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.110

<v Speaker 2>Thank you.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:43.650
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.450
<v Speaker 0>How many people have voted?

<v Speaker 0>Not a lot of people have voted yet.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:04.130
<v Speaker 0>So when you need to do multiple choice questions of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.770
<v Speaker 0>this type.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.730
<v Speaker 0>So you have either this happens or that happens.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 0>Try to think carefully about what the question is asking

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 0>because this is really important as we will see in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.090
<v Speaker 0>the answer of these questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,81,94]}

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay, let's do it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.870
<v Speaker 0>So what do we think about these results?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 0>So who agrees with the most voted item which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:41.790
<v Speaker 0>to.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 0>You agree?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100]}

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.630
<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 6>So first the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.350
<v Speaker 6>Uh, so the first one, by the definition of an

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 6>integral, it has to be the area that is enclosed

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.990
<v Speaker 6>by the graph of f and the both and the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 6>two bounded lines.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 6>X equals a and x equals b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.270
<v Speaker 6>And that also means that number two needs to be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 6>correct because as it is an area it has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 6>be a number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.990
<v Speaker 0>So I want to do a thought experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.790
<v Speaker 0>Now we said that the integral between A and b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.150
<v Speaker 0>of f of x dx is the area bounded by

<v Speaker 0>that two points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,100,100]}

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.290
<v Speaker 0>What if the area is under the x axis?

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 0>Think about this for a moment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.090
<v Speaker 0>What happens if I have a function that looks like

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:33.410
<v Speaker 0>this?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.730
<v Speaker 0>And I'm calculating the area between A and B.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,95,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.530
<v Speaker 0>What is the sine of that integral?

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.810
<v Speaker 0>Negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 0>Can we have an area which is negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.250
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.810
<v Speaker 0>So what is the problem with the first question?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.410
<v Speaker 0>With the first answer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 0>That that is true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 0>That the integral is the area bounded by the graph

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.510
<v Speaker 0>Be careful because this catches out all students.

<v Speaker 0>Every time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.390
<v Speaker 0>When you are asked about an area, you are asked

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 0>about the measure of something that cannot be negative, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 0>The area cannot be negative like the measure of a

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.350

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.190
<v Speaker 0>In the worst cases it's zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100]}

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 0>So for example, if I look at my function here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.110
<v Speaker 0>up on the board and I did the calculations, the

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.230
<v Speaker 0>area I think would come up to zero, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95]}

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 0>Because this at the bottom and at the top, I

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.590
<v Speaker 0>think if I remember correctly, my example, they are the

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.990
<v Speaker 0>same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.070
<v Speaker 0>Is it possible that the area under the curve, this

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 0>curve is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.510
<v Speaker 0>But our eyes tell you that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Speaker 0>Tell us that this is not possible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.550
<v Speaker 0>So what is the issue here?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.790
<v Speaker 0>That when I ask about the area, I ask about

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.629
<v Speaker 0>a measure of something that has to be positive.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 0>So to say that the integral is the area is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 0>not correct is the mod of the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,40,100,88,100]}

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.470
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.270
<v Speaker 0>So it's the absolute value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100]}

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 0>Why do I eat?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96]}

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.450
<v Speaker 0>So let's have a look at Finnish to have a

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:23.530
<v Speaker 0>look at this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.010
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89]}

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.450
<v Speaker 0>If I wanted to calculate the integral between that two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.490
<v Speaker 0>points of my function, the way in which I should

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.169
<v Speaker 0>do is this way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 0>The area is the mod of that integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,46,100]}

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:42.169
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.850
<v Speaker 0>Because this tells me that the area is these two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,95,100]}

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.970
<v Speaker 0>So when you are required to say whether something is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:54.290
<v Speaker 0>something like in this case, is this integral the area

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.929
<v Speaker 0>of something?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100]}

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 0>Try to think about what you're being asked.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,41,77,99]}

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.970
<v Speaker 0>The area by definition cannot be negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:06.130
<v Speaker 0>So obviously the first question was not correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.530
<v Speaker 0>And the correct version of the first of the first

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.290
<v Speaker 0>point there would have been.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:20.750
<v Speaker 0>Is it true that the the mode of the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,85,100,82,100,100,100]}

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:26.190
<v Speaker 0>Between a and b of f of x dx is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.270
<v Speaker 0>equal to the area.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:28.350
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 0>So be careful with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 0>This catches up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.470
<v Speaker 0>Also, I don't really know why students find this quite

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:36.310
<v Speaker 0>difficult, but they do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100]}

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 0>So think about what you have been asked to find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.150
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.830
<v Speaker 0>And this is the calculation for that particular for that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,96,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.110
<v Speaker 0>particular function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.390
<v Speaker 0>The second one of course is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.990
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.510
<v Speaker 0>So the second one is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.350
<v Speaker 0>And that is indeed the definition of integral okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.070
<v Speaker 0>So we are happy I said that the integral is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,97,100,100,100,74]}

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.310
<v Speaker 0>is its definition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,100]}

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.190
<v Speaker 0>So that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.190
<v Speaker 0>What about the third one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:07.030
<v Speaker 0>Well the third one cannot be first of all because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.230
<v Speaker 0>we have seen that the first one is not correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 0>But also because the antiderivative is a function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,96,100,100,100]}

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.870
<v Speaker 0>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:20.930
<v Speaker 0>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93]}

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.010
<v Speaker 7>Shouldn't be inside the interval.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,66,100,100,96]}

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64]}

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 0>You want to put the mod on the value that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,58,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.490
<v Speaker 0>you find, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100]}

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.290
<v Speaker 7>Six minus four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,99,99]}

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:36.410
<v Speaker 7>That's two over one six plus modulus minus four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:38.690
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.210
<v Speaker 0>Depends on the shape of the function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.770
<v Speaker 0>But you want the mod or the pieces.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,52,100,100]}

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.530
<v Speaker 0>So this is a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 0>So the situation is a little bit more complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:47.930
<v Speaker 0>It's a really good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.770
<v Speaker 0>Thank you for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:56.690
<v Speaker 0>So if my function was to find this area okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.970
<v Speaker 0>Then I have the mod of that function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.330
<v Speaker 0>But in the case I want to find this area

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,92,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.090
<v Speaker 0>as I had in the slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,74]}

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:09.850
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.730
<v Speaker 0>So say that I wanted to find the integral between

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:14.410
<v Speaker 0>C and b.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 0>I would have to split the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.670
<v Speaker 0>The first integral is positive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.710
<v Speaker 0>The second integral is negative and I take the mod

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,93,35,94,100,76]}

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.230
<v Speaker 0>of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:22.790
<v Speaker 0>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.070
<v Speaker 0>That was really a good question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,57,99,100,100]}

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 0>So what were we.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,49,91,100]}

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:31.270
<v Speaker 0>So the fourth my fourth option.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 0>Is always not correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,100,100,100]}

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.910
<v Speaker 0>So the fourth option we remember is that the function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,93,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.590
<v Speaker 0>is continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.070
<v Speaker 0>Then the integral doesn't always exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.830
<v Speaker 0>And again this is not correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,41,47,100,100]}

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.510
<v Speaker 0>I'm told the function is continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.750
<v Speaker 0>Obviously I'm really only interested in the integral of if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,57,100]}

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.710
<v Speaker 0>I have a definite integral only interest in the interval

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,89,66,100,100,100]}

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.550
<v Speaker 0>in which I'm.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.630
<v Speaker 0>I'm calculating the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.390
<v Speaker 0>If I want to calculate the indefinite integral, then I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 0>need it to be continuous everywhere, because otherwise there would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,92,65]}

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.150
<v Speaker 0>be possible where it doesn't exist.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,98,100,100,100]}

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.390
<v Speaker 0>But I am told that this is continuous in A

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,65,65,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.870
<v Speaker 0>and B, and therefore only the second option is correct.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:15.730
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.330
<v Speaker 0>So let's see one more question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96,54]}

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Much.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94]}

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,34,77]}

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68]}

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60]}

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:02.150
<v Speaker 2>That's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[27]}

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.370
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.890
<v Speaker 0>So this is quite quick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.090
<v Speaker 0>And the issue here is um naming issue.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,66,100,100]}

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:32.530
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 0>So it's our call things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,72,100]}

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.210
<v Speaker 0>I have here the same function under the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 0>And as an outcome of the integral.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.330
<v Speaker 0>And this is of course not what I want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:44.610
<v Speaker 0>have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.210
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.450
<v Speaker 0>Because as the way in which this, this equation is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.810
<v Speaker 0>written at the moment is telling me that the derivative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,95,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.810
<v Speaker 0>of the integral between f of x a and b

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.930
<v Speaker 0>of f of x dx is f of x, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.170
<v Speaker 0>is obviously not true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.570
<v Speaker 0>So the way in which I want to write this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:06.810
<v Speaker 0>equality is by using another symbol.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:07.130
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.610
<v Speaker 0>In this case I've used capital F for the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:10.970
<v Speaker 0>function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.870
<v Speaker 0>The idea here is that you need to check and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,97,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.830
<v Speaker 0>be careful with the notation, right in that in that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,76,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Speaker 0>formula, the notation was wrong in the sense that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.070
<v Speaker 0>notation, if you write it correctly, would give you a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:22.950
<v Speaker 0>false result.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.350
<v Speaker 0>And we call f capital f of x the integral

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.790
<v Speaker 0>between a or x of f of t and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,58,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 0>f of x is f of x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.270
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.950
<v Speaker 0>So be careful how you write mathematics.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:39.870
<v Speaker 0>Writing mathematics is not easy sometimes, but it's often precise.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.310
<v Speaker 0>So.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:49.470
<v Speaker 0>Question six and as always I'm going to put the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,100,86]}

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.630
<v Speaker 0>slides online I apologise I put the slides for week

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.350
<v Speaker 0>one online and I didn't realise that I couldn't see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,88,100,100,100,100,100,90,100,100]}

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:55.630
<v Speaker 0>them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.790
<v Speaker 6>Why wasn't.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64]}

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:01.230
<v Speaker 2>It true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100]}

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.990
<v Speaker 0>Because let me just switch this off.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:21.210
<v Speaker 0>So that the main reason is that I used the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,56,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.050
<v Speaker 0>same symbol for the integral between a and b of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.330
<v Speaker 0>a for x and the outcome, and so I need

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,73,99,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.530
<v Speaker 0>to use a different symbol for the antiderivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 0>And this explanation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,62,96]}

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.650
<v Speaker 0>Yeah there is an explanation in the slides.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:36.690
<v Speaker 0>But I want to go I've got I think two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 0>more questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.850
<v Speaker 0>So I want to finish before we finish.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.570
<v Speaker 0>But there is a calculation in the slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,94,91]}

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Why does he.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,46,46]}

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.170
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so that's excellent.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.650
<v Speaker 0>Somebody that tells me why that is false.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.370
<v Speaker 0>What do we think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99,86,100]}

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90]}

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78]}

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91]}

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.490
<v Speaker 8>Um, f of x and g of x could be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.490
<v Speaker 8>different by some constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.850
<v Speaker 0>So this is exactly the point, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 0>F of x and g of x could be different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 0>functions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.690
<v Speaker 0>And that differ by a constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,77,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 0>One could be three x plus three and the other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.370
<v Speaker 0>one could be three x.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.610
<v Speaker 0>These are not the same function but the derivatives are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:52.090
<v Speaker 0>the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:52.810
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.970
<v Speaker 0>So be careful again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:56.210
<v Speaker 0>Just think about what you're looking for.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 0>So shall we do the last one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.790
<v Speaker 2>How do you think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,100,100,99]}

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.650
<v Speaker 2>The white.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[37,39]}

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 2>House.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 0>Okay, so we have three minutes left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:11.830
<v Speaker 0>So let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:14.630
<v Speaker 0>What happened?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,95]}

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 0>Why is this true?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.950
<v Speaker 0>So think about the process of integration.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 0>And what is the difference with the process of calculating

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.110
<v Speaker 0>the derivative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 0>Why do we think that that's true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.670
<v Speaker 0>Which it is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:37.110
<v Speaker 0>Oh thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 6>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95]}

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.910
<v Speaker 6>Um, so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 9>I did like integration of f of x is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.310
<v Speaker 9>to a big f of x plus let's say c

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,97,98,60]}

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.230
<v Speaker 9>a constant one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100]}

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.630
<v Speaker 9>And then integration of g of x is equal to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:52.590
<v Speaker 9>a big g of x plus constant two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.510
<v Speaker 9>And then f of x plus constant one has to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 9>be equal to g of x plus constant two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,80]}

00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.790
<v Speaker 0>Exactly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 0>So this is the the nice way of doing it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 0>So you calculate the integral, the g of x and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 0>f of x by having some different concepts.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,94]}

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.170
<v Speaker 0>If the integrals of this function need to be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.610
<v Speaker 0>same, then the constant need to be the same, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.770
<v Speaker 0>The quick way of of saying it is that these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 0>functions have the same antiderivative, and therefore they need to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,94,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 0>be the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.890
<v Speaker 0>And this should be in your book.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:31.050
<v Speaker 0>So just to kind of plug up this idea that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93]}

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:35.250
<v Speaker 0>for two functions, if they have the same derivative, there

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.730
<v Speaker 0>is no saying whether they are the same function or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.130
<v Speaker 0>not.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 0>But if they have the same integral then they are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.210
<v Speaker 0>the same function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 0>And we can show this quite quickly.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.090
<v Speaker 0>Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 0>So I shall see you Thursday.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 0>And don't forget about the workshops tomorrow.
