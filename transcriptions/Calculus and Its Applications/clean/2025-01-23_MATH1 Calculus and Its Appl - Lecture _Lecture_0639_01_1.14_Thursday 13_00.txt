However.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to, , , calculus and its applications.
, this is our second lecture of the week, and
we continue to explore limits and continuity of functions.
, so let's just jump right in.
, sorry, I have to, , there is a whole
club question for you here.
, yes, you can see it.
, please vote on it in the next.
Can you actually see it, though?
.
Yeah, maybe this is better.
Yeah.
In the next couple of minutes, you can discuss with
your peers.
Okay, I think.
Oh, okay.
, well, I think it has been five minutes.
And the voting, almost everyone voted, although there are
still some votes, I think, coming in.
, okay.
Well, interesting.
Interesting.
We have, , we have two popular answers.
One of them has the majority.
, the other one is also pretty, , I'd say
pretty popular.
All right, let's let's think about this together.
.
Oh.
Okay.
Good.
, right.
First of all.
First of all, whenever you see something this.
Some kind of inequality.
inequality.
Including, sorry, not including involving three, , functions.
And you're asked about the limit.
I hope your intuition immediately starts screaming two words.
What are those words?
Yes.
Squeeze theorem.
Exactly.
So, you know, whatever.
You see this and you're .
, it looks something's being squeezed.
Squeezed in.
And you see limit.
You're , squeeze theorem.
Now, the thing is, you cannot immediately unless you remember
the statement by heart of the squeeze theorem, you cannot
immediately apply it.
You have to be careful.
Right.
But your first instinct is, oh, this looks it
could use the squeeze theorem, but your next step should
be.
Oh, let me go and check the statement and see
if it really applies here.
Because maybe I cannot apply that theorem because some of
the assumptions of the theorem are not satisfied.
So I you have your squeeze theorem.
And , let me.
.
Oh, sorry.
, that's that's not great.
That's not great.
Okay.
Well, unfortunately, now I know how to fix this.
I know how to fix this.
I will switch one of them to cam, and I
will write the question now.
So we have.
So we have f of x is Minus one over
three.
X cubed plus x squared minus seven over three.
And we have h of x cosine phi over two
x.
We have this.
When x is close enough whatever that means to two.
Okay.
So those are the assumptions in our in the in
the question.
Okay.
Now let's go check your squeeze theorem.
So your squeeze theorem is where I will find it
now.
And together we'll check if it's good.
It's right here.
Right.
So let's check that the assumptions of the theorem apply.
So we need f, g and h x to be
defined for all x not equal to A.
A in this case is two right on an open
interval containing a.
Well, we're lucky this one holds everywhere because what do
we have.
We have a nice polynomial.
Polynomials are defined everywhere.
And we have cosine which is also defined everywhere.
So the first assumption of the theorem is satisfied.
This one.
Good check.
Let's move on to the next one.
Now for this one we have to be slightly more
careful.
Right now this holds for x not equal to two
in an open interval Containing a write all.
So our question tells us that this holds when x
is close enough to two.
So let's make some sense of this.
And to make some sense of this I will have
to show you some graphs.
On GeoGebra.
Okay, so I, I sketched the the functions that are
in the question.
So the green one is the polynomial and the blue
one is the cosine obviously.
Now let's look what happens right.
So this this makes sense when we're somewhere here right.
It doesn't make sense for example here because Because here
the blue graph lies above the sorry, the green graph.
The polynomial lies above the blue one, but around two.
And that's where we're interested.
That's the region we're interested in.
This is fine.
So our question tells us that the this third, ,
function, whose limit we want to compute it lies somewhere
here.
It lies here.
And it doesn't matter that they intersect at two.
Because the point two we're not really interested in.
Because you see, it says x not equal to two.
But if we take an open interval around two, for
example, I don't know the interval from 0 to 4
or from 1 to 3 or even a very
small one here, from One and a half to
two and a half.
Doesn't matter.
It just has to be open.
Then this.
This is fine.
We are okay.
And our question tells us that this also this condition
is also satisfied.
So we have an interval which shows an interval.
Let's say from 1 to 3.
And this this inequality is satisfied.
So both assumptions of the squeeze theorem are now satisfied.
So we're safe.
And we can say that the function that's in the
middle, its limit at the point two at this point
will be the same as the limit of these two
functions at that point.
Right.
Are there any questions about what I have said until
this point.
Yes, please.
So I have to come closer.
Yeah.
Oh, excellent question, excellent question.
Very good question.
, right.
Excellent question.
, let me switch to the projector.
Very important question.
What does what is an open interval?
, right.
So in, in this course.
So or for functions.
, well no let us say on R right.
We're interested in the real rail line.
Open intervals are intervals of the form.
A b.
So for example A, where a is less than b.
Right.
And the endpoints are not included.
So it's here this part where unfortunately I don't have
another colour of a pad.
But these these points are not included.
So basically all the points between A and B not
including A and B.
So right.
That's a let me zoom out so that you can
see this better.
Right.
So all the points.
Between A and B not.
Including.
A and B.
Does that answer the question?
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
But that's a very good question because it's, , this
is one of the.
Main, , extremely important objects in calculus and analysis.
Open sets or open intervals.
, in this case, we're interested in an interval.
, are.
The they are the.
You will see it maybe next here or maybe later.
But they are the basis of something called topology on
your space.
So this is a very fundamental and very important object.
It's crucial that you understand what it is.
Okay.
So now that we've taken care of that.
Let's go back.
Maybe this.
Oh, actually sorry.
Sorry about that.
Okay.
Right.
So that was the open interval business.
Now we can apply the squeeze theorem because we checked
that everything's satisfied.
So, , , using the squeeze theorem.
Limit as x goes to two of g of x
has to be equal to the limit as x goes
to two of f of x, and the limit as
x goes to two of h of x.
And they better be the same.
But.
They will be.
So f of x is the polynomial.
It's continuous.
I can just plug in two times a plus four
minus seven over three minus five plus four is minus
one.
And the limit of cosine pi over two times x.
That's just.
Of cosine by that's also minus one.
Very good.
Hence Limit of x.
Sorry of G.
, minus one.
Okay.
So.
, so this was the correct answer.
Okay.
, right.
Are there any questions about this question?
I think this is the longest question on today's, ,
from today's list.
So make sure if you have any questions, please ask.
So what did we do?
We looked at the question and we thought, oh, that
reminds me of the squeeze theorem.
But then the next step is can I actually apply
the squeeze theorem?
Let me check all the assumptions.
We checked all the assumptions.
We figured out we could indeed apply the squeeze theorem.
And we did.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
I will move to the next question then.
Oh, why are they also okay?
Is this true or is this false?
The function x squared minus four x plus three divided
by x squared minus one is continuous over the interval
closed interval from 0 to 3.
That gives me another opportunity to remind you of some
topology which I will use.
So yeah please vote and you can discuss with each
other.
Okay, so the voting seems to have slowed down by
a lot, although not everyone has voted.
Well, let's just discuss the question in that case.
Well, so the question is, , is the following statement
true or false?
, do we have the dog camp still?
Yes we do.
Sorry about that.
, okay, so first of all, let me get something
out of the way.
We talked about open intervals in the previous question and
here we have the interval.
Well, right.
This , so this is referred to as a closed
interval.
Right.
So it is, it is all the points from 0
to 3, including this time including zero and three.
So all the points.
Between 0 and 3 including.
Zero and three.
Right.
So all everything here.
Yeah.
, so if we had if by contrast, we had.
We had the interval.
this, then these parts will not be would not
be included.
So the difference between.
Between.
Closed.
Open is the inclusion.
Or exclusion.
Of the endpoints.
Okay.
So that's that's what we have here now.
Okay.
now the question is is the following function.
Is continuous.
On.
Okay.
What does that mean?
So if you.
, if you go to.
, where that must be 186 the, .
So here on page 186, you have the definition of,
, continuity over interval.
So a function is continuous over a closed interval of
this form.
If it's continuous at every point.
Yeah.
So a function is continuous over an open interval.
Okay.
Well no.
Over.
So it's continuous over a closed interval of this form.
F is continuous at every point in the open interval,
and it's continuous from the right at the at a
and from the left at b.
Okay.
So need to check.
That.
Let me check a x squared minus four x
plus three and so on is continuous at every point.
And here and continuous from the right.
At zero and from the left at three.
Now the thing is, , in this case.
So what's the problem in this case?
, so those of you who voted.
No, it's the correct answer.
But what was the problem?
Why did you vote?
No.
Yes, please.
I'm sorry.
Did you raise your hand?
Yes.
It is.
That's correct.
So the problem is at the point where x equals
one, right?
Yes.
Very good indeed.
So the problem is that this function is not defined
when x equals one.
So and .
So the answer is no.
Because the function is not defined at x equals one.
And if you're not defined at that point, you can't
be continuous.
Yes.
And by the way x equals one belongs to the
open interval zero three.
So.
It's .
So the first assumption there.
So this one is violated.
It's not continuous at every point because the point one
is here and the function is not continuous at that
point.
So this function is not continuous on the on the
close interval.
Right.
So remember the definition of continuity.
We needed the the the limit at the point to
equal the value of the function at that point.
So we cannot it cannot be continuous at all because
the function doesn't even have a value at one okay.
So this function is not continuous at the on this
interval because it is not even defined at one.
Are there any questions about this.
Just a matter of checking.
Going back to definitions.
So looking at the definitions and see if they are
satisfied.
Okay next question.
Why is that.
Why are they also.
Okay.
Excellent.
So often we will see functions given in this form
where it's given by one by some kind of formula
on one part of the real line and by another
formula on the other part of the real line.
And you have to check some statements about these functions.
, all right, so we have some, , , we're
voting a bit more reluctantly.
, but.
And we have, .
Well, so.
Okay, let's, let's let's discuss this together.
So.
, when you have a function of this form.
Right.
So you see that if x is less than one,
, your function is x squared, which is a nice,
, polynomial function, and it is continuous.
, everywhere.
, well, actually everywhere.
And when x is greater than or equal to one,
you have the square root which is also a nice
continuous function.
So your only problem could be where they meet because
you don't know how they meet and what happens there.
So we need to investigate whether it's continuous at this
point where they meet.
Right.
Well, let's do that.
So let's do that.
So.
Okay.
.
Let me just put that here.
Okay.
We need to see what happens at.
At the point.
X equals one.
Right.
So the value of the function f at one is.
So we are in this situation.
So it's one here is square root of one.
So one good.
so in order to check continuity we have to
check if the limit at that point is also one.
So to check continuity.
, need to check if limit as x goes to
one of f.
, x is one.
Yeah.
So we need to evaluate the left limit and the
right limit.
So as x goes to one from the left of
f of x is what.
So when x is less than one it's this.
Well this is just one right.
So I chose I'm using this function because when we
go when we approach one from the left it's right.
Right.
Yes.
Our function is equal to x squared and the limit
is one.
Now when we approach one from the right.
Oh, sorry.
This is equal to.
Now the function becomes a square root of x.
Because when you're greater than one it's the square root
of x.
Well but the limit here is also one.
Okay.
So thus the we have limit.
Of f of x from the left equals limit of
f of x from the right and equals f at
one.
Hence f is continuous.
At x equals one.
Okay.
So what did we what did we do to summarise?
, we, the function.
We realised that the only problem this function could have
was that the place where these functions meet.
Right.
, so at one and then we investigated the behaviour
of that function, namely the continuity.
And we realised that the left limit equals the right
limit and equals the value of the function at that
point.
Hence it is continuous at that point.
And therefore this whole thing is continuous everywhere.
Are there any questions?
Do you have a question.
No.
Okay.
So and let's let's maybe solve one more question.
here.
Okay.
This should be relatively simple because we have seen.
something about this in the previous lecture.
It's.
Okay.
Thank.
You.
Thank you.
Okay.
, we have two minutes left, So let's discuss the
answer.
Why?
Well, the as overwhelming as the overwhelming majority chose false.
And they are correct.
So what's the problem here?
Well, we also need the function to be defined at
the point.
And we need the value of the function to agree
with those limits.
Right.
So this statement is false.
It's false because yeah you can have the two limits
existing and agreeing.
But the function will not be defined at the point.
And in fact I will remind you we had we
had an example in the previous lecture.
Remember here both limits exist and equal but the
function is not defined here, hence it's not continuous at
that point.
Okay, so this is all for today.
, I will see you in week four and at
the workshops.
Thank you very much.
