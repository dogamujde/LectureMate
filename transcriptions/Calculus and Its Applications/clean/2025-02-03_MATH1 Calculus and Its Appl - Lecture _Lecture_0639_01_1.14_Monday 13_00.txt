Hi.
Hello everyone.
So welcome to week four of calculus and its applications.
So today we'll talk about the application of.
So last week you saw will you define derivatives and
you studied some properties.
And today we will learn about the applications of derivatives.
And there are plenty because indeed it's you know it's
the one of the oh here it is.
, it's one of the fundamental, , , definitions in
calculus.
So here are all the, , , all the applications
listed in your textbook.
And today we will look, , we will solve problems,
, related to some of these.
And we will continue on with the others on Thursday.
So let's jump right in.
So the, , the well, it depends on your point
of view, but for me, , what a derivative is,
is.
First of all, first and foremost, a linear approximation of
a function at a point.
So in this question we ask you to find the
linear approximation to this function.
Sorry cubic root of one plus x.
And we wanted at point A equals zero.
And now I will I will load that on.
We'll clap for you so that you can vote.
Let's see if that's okay.
That should work.
And let me hide the results.
Okay, so a couple of minutes for this.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Okay.
So.
This is for the first time.
It's not.
Yes.
Thank you.
Very much.
I don't remember.
Exactly.
So check it.
Out.
I think.
So.
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
You.
Should.
Not be.
Surprised.
That.
They Oh.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
.
Okay.
I think we can, , we can look at the
results.
So what are the results?
Good.
Yeah.
I tend to agree with the majority.
So let's see why.
Well, to be honest, this is not a very deep
question.
You just have to remember the definition of a linear
approximation at a point.
So here's the definition.
You.
You need to find your derivative at the at the
point of interest.
And so this is just the formula that's in your
book.
Basically this is a very computational exercise.
You don't have to think much.
Okay.
You don't have to think much.
Just know the formula and.
Plug in the numbers.
So if you calculate the derivative of this function it's
this this is the expression you get.
You evaluate it at zero because that's the point you
want.
So you put a you need to put it there.
And so this the this is the expression you obtain.
And once you, , you know, compute everything you get
one plus one over three x.
Are there any questions about this?
It's just as I said, there is not much, ,
nothing really deep going on.
You just have to know the formula for.
I mean, if you if you think about it, of
course, you can make everything deep.
You can think about why this is true and everything,
but, , you don't need all that to answer the
question, right?
Okay, well let's move on to the to the next
question.
So determine the two positive numbers whose sum is 300
and whose product is a maximum.
So you need to find two positive numbers.
So sum is 300.
And the product is the maximum value that you can
obtain out of all the numbers who hold the positive
numbers whose sum is 300?
Is the question clear?
oh.
Here.
This is the question I am asking them in in
a different order today.
So, , wait, let me hide the results.
Yes.
Okay.
We have, , most people voted.
Let's see the results.
Nice.
So the results are, .
Oh, wait.
Yeah.
Okay, so I will display the correct answer.
Very good.
Well done.
, so let's let's see why this is true.
, so obviously another important application of, , derivative is,
, finding maxima and minima of a function.
And there are, , but you cannot just blindly, you
know, , do things you have to think about which
results you're using.
So.
Well, first, let's, , denote the numbers by x and
, 300 minus x.
So we have to maximise the following function.
And , , something that, you know, is very tempting
to do and indeed will work in this case.
Just find the derivative, set it equal to zero and
see, , what point you get.
So let's see what kind of solution you get.
, so setting the derivative equal to zero in this
case will give you a 150.
So this is the only critical point.
So is this a maximum.
And does the maximum occur at this point.
So to theoretically justify this result you have to think
of you have to use a very important theorem.
it's the extreme value theorem.
Right.
So if your function is continuous over the closed bounded
interval AB, then there is a point at which f
has an absolute maximum over AB.
, so I will not say anything about the minimum.
We need the maximum here, and the location is either
at the critical point.
So where your derivative is zero or at the end
point.
So we have to check the behaviour of the function
at the end point.
Lucky for us, at the end points we just get.
So the values of this function at the end point
just give us zero.
So obviously that can't be the maximum.
So indeed the point that we we found was the
point of maximum and the value of the function is
22,500.
, so that's it.
There's that's it.
So the point of this question was that, you know,
you should find the critical points.
But also don't forget what happens at the at the
end of your interval.
In this case, it wasn't relevant.
It didn't give us the maximum, but sometimes it does.
Are there any questions about this?
This question.
I'll give you a second.
Because we have time.
That's good.
Okay.
So we use the extreme value theorem.
Good.
Let's move on.
Oh this is my favourite question in today's.
, well, yeah, in today's lecture.
So Alex is driving from Edinburgh to Glasgow and the
first police radar And camera control is at 14 miles
and the radar measures Alex's speed at this time.
10:15 a.m..
As 59mph.
The second control is at 3531 miles and measures Alex's
speed at 1030 as 58mph.
The speed limit is 60mph.
Will Alex get a speeding ticket?
So.
Here's Alex.
I will hide the results, and we will together find
out if Alex will get a speeding ticket or not.
And of course, we have to be cautious of which
results are we using?
Okay.
The.
Oh, the voting is still going on.
Well, okay.
, let's let's look at the results.
, yes.
So, , we think Alex will get a speeding ticket,
and I agree with that.
, but, , what was the result we used?
What's the, , what's why?
Basically.
Yes, please.
The times of the speed cameras.
The distance between them shows us that Alex went to
17 miles in 15 minutes.
And turning that into miles per hour.
You can get an average speed of 68mph, which is
a lot higher than 60.
That's correct.
So the average speed was a lot higher than 60.
That's correct.
So the speed limit is 60.
And why does this.
So what's the result that tells us that at some
point the speed had to exceed 60.
Yeah.
Very good value theorem indeed.
So it's one of my favourite theorems.
So you know, it's it's a it's not a bike.
It may not be very impressive, but it lurks in
a lot of results.
Right.
So.
Right.
So by recall the mean value theorem that if you
have a continuous function on a closed interval and it's
differentiable on the open interval within that closed interval, then
there exists a point in the open interval such that
the average of the function is equals the the derivative
at that point.
As.
And as we said we.
The first camera detects Alex at 14 miles sorry from
Edinburgh at 1015.
And then 15 minutes later He's at or they're at
31 miles.
So.
So Alex travelled 17 miles in 15 minutes.
And that gives us the average speed of 68mph.
Therefore, by the mean value theorem, at some point the
so the the the speed must have been 68mph, which
exceeds the speed limit.
So once again this is the statement.
And , here is another, , you know, if you
ask several people what's what the derivative means to
them.
They will, , probably give you a different answers, and
one of them will be the instantaneous speed at the,
at the, at a point.
So we are exploiting that the definition of a derivative
or that interpretation of the derivative.
Okay.
Very good.
Well done.
, next.
oh.
So I the mean value theorem so much that
I don't want to leave it.
So one of the corollaries of the mean value theorem
is that, , , so, , if you have a
continuous function on a closed interval and differentiable on an
open interval, and then the sign of its derivative tells
you whether your, , function is strictly increasing, decreasing, or
constant.
So this is a consequence of the mean value theorem.
And another very important application is the fundamental theorem of
calculus.
So these are modest and humble looking results.
They can .
They are the building blocks of something more, , maybe
more impressive and more celebrated.
Okay, nice.
The next question is very short.
Is the following statement true or false?
The origin.
So the point x equals zero is an inflection point
of the function f of x equals x to the
power of four.
, well obviously to answer this question you have to
remember what's the definition of an inflection point.
, where is that question?
Oh, here.
It's the first question.
So let me hide the results and let's vote.
Right.
Okay.
So, I mean, I don't know if you pay attention,
but, you know, each question is supposed to, , investigate
or, you know, eliminate one.
One, , or let's say some application of the derivative.
And one of them is, , , studying the behaviour
of a function or sketching a graph.
So this is what we're doing in this question.
, so the orange is the origin, an inflection point
of this function.
Let's see how we voted.
oh.
That's pretty close.
Okay.
Interesting.
, right.
So, well, let's let's discuss this together.
As I said, you just have to recall the definition
of an inflection point.
What is an inflection point?
An inflection point is a point where your function changes
concavity.
Right.
So.
, so if if your function was, concave up
at, at, , before arriving at the, at the point
and then it changed into concave down, that would be
an inflection point.
And concavity is determined by the sine of the second
derivative.
So if you're a second derivative at the point were
to change the sine, then that point would be the
inflection point.
However, for this function, taking the second derivative gives you.
It gives you 12 x squared.
12 x squared is positive everywhere except zero, so it's
not really changing , the sign.
Right?
So it's not an inflection point.
And to illustrate this, let's look at a graph.
So this is what the graph looks .
And indeed you can see that it's not changing concavity
at this point.
So so this is f of x.
And it's the concavity stays the same.
Are there any questions about this one.
Oh sorry I didn't show you the correct answer.
The correct answer is false.
Any questions.
So as some of these questions are just about remembering
definitions of things and applying them.
What is happening there?
Okay.
Okay.
What's the time?
Good.
We have.
We have some time.
, the next question is about limits.
We need to find the limit of this function.
And let me find that question for you here.
Okay.
Let's, let's let's calculate and vote.
Oh.
Okay.
, let's, .
So, , fewer people have voted.
Then I was hoping.
But it's fine.
Let's discuss this question together.
So obviously another very important application of derivatives is in
evaluating limits.
And what's the result that helps us do that.
What did you use to answer this question?
Just you can just yell.
At us.
That's correct.
The thing is, I want you to, you know, obviously
use all of these rules there.
That's why they are there.
But always, always think whether you can because sometimes you
cannot apply those rules.
For example, L'Hopital's rule is, , okay.
I didn't, I thought I copied the statement for you.
But L'Hopital's rule has some requirements, right?
So the functions need to be differentiable at an open
interval containing the point.
, the point you're interested in.
And lucky for us both a natural logarithm of x
and this one obviously e to the power of x
minus e.
Both these functions are differentiable at the at an open
interval containing the point one.
And , if you plug in one, you will get
zero divided by zero.
So you can indeed apply the rule here.
And, , I've written this here, but I didn't I
didn't copy the statement of L'Hopital's rule.
But.
But please be aware that you need to check the
conditions that.
Indeed, you can use L'Hopital's rule because sometimes you can't.
Even if you do get a nice fraction of the
form zero zero.
But let's say that one of the conditions of l'Hopital
breaks down.
For example, these functions are not differentiable at an open
interval containing the point.
Okay.
So , right.
Well, just applying it gives us.
So the derivative of maybe.
Do I have time?
Yeah I do have time.
, let me first show you the correct answer.
It's one over E.
Well done.
And then I'll show you.
How to compute things.
But I think, you know, just to be sure.
Ah, so we have limit as x goes to one
l and x divided by e to the x minus
e.
It's the same by L'Hopital's rule which we check that
we can apply.
And this gives us one over x divided by e
to the x.
Now that gives me.
Oh sorry.
Always forget this one okay.
One over one divided by E to the power one.
And that just gives me one over E.
Okay.
So all right so for today these are the questions
we covered today.
And on Thursday we will continue exploring other applications of
the derivative.
We will also do some more of these limit type
questions Shows more involved ones, more difficult ones.
So I'll see you on Thursday.
