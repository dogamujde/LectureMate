Hello, everyone.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
There is a slight technical difficulty with one of the
projectors.
I've asked for help.
So could you just maybe wait one minute or, .
And then I'll, , we'll see what's happening.
Sorry.
Thank you for your patience.
Okay, so while we're waiting, let's just introduce ourselves.
So my name is Lily, and I'll be your lecturer
for this week, which is week two of calculus and
its applications, where we will, , explore limits and continuity.
, so I have a list of questions for you.
So by now you know how this class works.
We ask you questions and you think about them, you
discuss with your peers, and then we figure out an
answer together.
, so.
Well, , as I already told you, one of the,
, projectors is not working.
So I will have to alternate between, , Wook lab
and slides on just one, , one projector.
, so sorry about that.
, let me just, , reset everything.
And I can, .
All right.
But you don't see the statement, do you?
Or.
.
Nope.
You don't see the statement.
Okay.
So I'm sorry about that.
, we have the following statement.
So is it true or false?
And now I have to put back the the the
the the the, , , options for you.
.
Okay.
So once again, I'll show you the question.
Or maybe this.
Oh, that is better, isn't it?
I think that's better.
Right?
, okay.
Cool.
Yes.
Why does it say you cannot vote anymore?
I don't understand that.
Can you click on the link?
Oh, , sorry about that.
I did something which prevents you from voting, which is
really annoying.
I'm sorry.
, how about if I reset the whole thing?
Maybe that will help.
Yeah, but the.
Problem is, we also saw the right answer.
You did?
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, sorry about that.
I don't know what's going on today.
, okay.
Well.
I am.
I am confused here, but.
Sure.
Okay.
Right.
, again, I only have one screen, so I will
have to switch this one to the visualiser.
All right.
And what did we have there?
We had the limit of.
SD goes to zero of one over t.
Minus.
S t.
Right.
So the question is.
Is this limit equal to one?
Right.
.
Let me.
Yeah.
Okay.
So what do we do with, , expressions these?
So first of all, let's, , notice that naively plugging
in zero doesn't quite work.
You know, you could be tempted to say that each
of these.
You can, , if you if I only had limit
of one over t s t goes to zero here.
, , then you have a result in your book
which says that this should be infinity, right?
However, doing the same thing with the other fraction will
also give you.
Infinity.
And then you're stuck with something infinity minus infinity.
, and that is something that you will soon learn
is called is it?
Oh, yes.
Thank you so much.
It's called an indeterminate form.
So whatever you wanted to do, maybe we're tempted to
do.
Doesn't quite work.
Okay.
But luckily, there's always another way.
Is it working now?
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
I just didn't come on at the start.
It didn't come off, but.
Yeah, it's just it was just cooling.
I tried to switch everything off and on, but it
still didn't work.
I had to.
Just use a remote, and it's overridden the cooling.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, now we have two screens.
Excellent.
, but still, let's, , let's finish this question.
Actually, you know what?
If we have two screens, why not use it?
So now you can see the the question on one
of the screens and the solution on the other.
Right.
So as I said, this naive approach does not work.
But what what does work?
Right.
, the following principle, in your, , in your
book, you have this, , approach of, , using a
function which is, , which agrees with your function everywhere
except the problematic point, and they should have the same
limits at that point.
So what does that imply for us?
What it implies for us is that we can, .
We can, , algebraically manipulate this expression, which is a
fancy way of saying.
Compute the this difference.
So, so what we need is to.
Right.
You can see everything, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I just do my regular, , my regular, ,
manipulations with fractions Actions.
And what does this tell me?
It tells me that.
Okay.
Well.
Okay, so this is what I'm doing.
And what I'm using here is this principle that if
you're if you have two functions.
So I'm talking about this function and this function which
agree everywhere except this problematic point t.
Sorry zero.
Right.
So I could only cancel t.
With, with the condition that t is not zero.
Right.
So these two agree everywhere except t equals zero.
And then they still they should have the same limit
at t equals zero, right?
, this is actually enough if it's, if it holds
on an open interval around zero.
But here it actually holds everywhere.
So we're fine.
Okay.
Well but this one now you can actually compute by
direct substitution right.
You can just put plug zero in here and you
get one.
Yeah.
So we had this expression right.
And we realised that we cannot just naively plug in
zero because we get infinity minus infinity.
Not good.
But what we could do instead is to by some
algebraic manipulation, we could reduce it to a function which
agrees with our, , with the function we started with
everywhere Except zero, and that we can use that to
deduce that they should have the same limit at zero,
which is one.
, sorry about the, , the, .
Something went wrong with a woo club in the beginning.
Hopefully the next attempt will be more successful.
And so something I'll do is I'll reset everything again.
And hopefully this will not mess up anything.
Okay.
, okay.
I think now this works.
I'll give you a couple of minutes to think about
it.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
We have an overwhelming support for, , for falls.
So.
Indeed.
You're right.
, but let's let's see.
Why is that?
Why is that the case?
So.
Well, again, we do this.
, how do we approach a question this?
Well, it kind of similarly to the previous one, but,
, you know, there will be slight differences.
So we have limit as x goes to minus one
of the expression x squared plus two x plus one
and divided by x to the fourth minus one.
Oh sorry.
You don't see that.
Okay.
Well what do we do.
We again manipulate this algebraically.
Into the following.
So we recognise hopefully that this is x plus one
squared divided by x to the fourth minus one.
But we can factorise that right.
We can factorise that into the following expression which we
can factorise further.
there.
Okay.
Now.
Well, you see again, plugging a minus one n on
top would give us zero, and on the bottom would
also give us zero.
So we would just plug it.
Well what was that.
I don't know either.
Okay.
Right.
So we would, , we would obtain an expression of
the form zero divided by zero, which is yet another
indeterminate form.
But we don't do that.
We use this principle of that.
We used in the previous example that if expressions agree
except one point on some open interval, then they will
have the same limit at that point.
And that's, that means we can just, , we can
just divide by x plus one, I divide by x
plus one.
And what I get here well is a nice expression
no longer.
So there is no longer any nothing gives you zero
in the denominator anymore.
And we can just plug minus one in and compute
that will give us that will give us zero divided
by something doesn't matter which is not infinity or zero.
Well, that gives you zero, so it is indeed not
infinity.
So you were correct about this question.
, okay.
So now we will switch to a slightly different kind
of question.
So I have to ask you, do you have any
questions about this or the previous question.
Because they used kind of a similar principle.
And in the next question we will move on to
something else.
Are there any questions about this one or the previous
one?
, no, there are no questions and most of you
chose the correct answer.
So I will just, , I will move on.
, okay.
The we have a slight.
Okay.
No, it's all right.
I can manage that.
So.
Okay.
Right.
So, .
Okay.
So.
.
On the on one screen, you have a picture, right?
And it has.
It's, , it depicts a function.
Please be careful about what all these things mean.
Right.
You can see that it's.
You know, it's not a it's kind of broken down
a little bit.
There are some, , coloured circles and some not coloured
circles.
, be conscious of what those things mean when you
answer that question.
I'll give you a couple of minutes here.
Let's.
Take.
, okay, so, , not everyone has voted, but I
think voting has more or less stopped.
So I think it makes sense to discuss this question
together.
So.
Right.
Okay.
, you most of you are correct.
So let's go through these, , options together.
What is happening?
, so first of all, let's look at the, ,
the picture.
What is happening on the picture?
, you have some sort of function which kind of
has a little jump or two.
Right?
And it's not.
It's not defined at point four.
So just be be aware of the fact that when
you have that little circle which is not coloured in,
that means that you can stop the discussion for a
moment.
The discussion is for when we are answering the question.
So those circles that are not coloured in, they.
Are.
Can you please be quiet?
Okay.
That means that, , the the the the the function's
value is not given at those points.
Right.
So what is this first thing here?
Sorry.
What is this first expression here?
Can you see this?
Well, this is the limit of the function as x
approaches two on the left.
Right.
Does everyone agree with that?
Yeah.
So?
So two is here.
I approach two from the left.
This limit exists, right?
This limit exists.
So everything's fine.
What is this expression?
Just somebody you can just shout.
Yes, please.
Exactly.
So it's the limit of this function as x approaches
two from the right and it does exist.
Two right.
Are those two limits equal?
Indeed, they are not equal.
And why was the so.
I think that has something to do with with,
with this , the third option.
So the limit of the function as x approaches two
does not exist, as most of you correctly answered, because
these two limits, as x approaches, two from the left
and from the right are not equal.
Okay.
And finally, the, , the value of f at two
Exists because, you know, despite the fact that we have
an uncoloured circle here.
Kind of an empty circle here.
We have a nice full circle up there.
And in fact, we would be in trouble if they
were both coloured.
And why would we be in trouble in that case?
So you see, what I'm referring to is that we
have an empty circle here and a full, nicely filled
in circle here.
So why couldn't we have two fully coloured circles?
Yes, please.
Exactly.
It would not be a function because it would have
two values at two.
So then f at the point two would be one
and three at the same time.
We're not allowed to have this.
If we are considering a function.
Very good.
Okay.
Are there any questions about this?
This assignment?
No questions.
Okay.
Let's move on to the next.
I think you will need a.
Yeah.
So again we have a picture on this screen and
the option and the question on the screen and the
options on the screen.
I'll give you some time to think about it and
then we'll discuss it together.
.
Okay, so the voting is still kind of going on,
but it has slowed down, , slowed down, , sufficiently
so because we have, , we need to move on
to the other question.
I will start discussing the answers with you.
, so these are the, .
So.
Okay.
We had to select all the statements that are correct.
So let's analyse this together.
Is this function continuous from the left at x equals
two.
Most of you said yes.
, why?
Why is that true?
So in the previous question, we, , we, , discovered
that the limit of this function as X approaches two
from the left existed.
Right?
That's all we were interested in in that previous question.
We only wanted to know if the limit as X
goes to sorry approaches two on the left exists.
Is that enough for continuity on the left at that
point?
Is the existence of the limit from the left?
So as x approaches to on the left is the
existence of the limit at that point enough to claim
that the function is continuous at that point.
Yeah.
You can just nod or shake your head.
Do something.
Okay.
So.
So we have a reluctant.
No.
And indeed that's true.
What else do we need for continuity?
What else?
What is missing?
No.
Don't look.
Not that.
It's not missing in this case.
But the question I asked was, is existence of the
limit enough?
And we said no, because we need something else.
And what is that?
Something else?
Right.
So it's not just.
It's not just enough that the limit exists at the
point, but it also has to equal to the to
the value of the function at that point.
Very good.
Which is actually satisfied here.
So the value of the function at that point is,
, what is it?
It's three and the limit is three as well.
So we're good.
So when we when we approach X from the left,
sorry.
When we approach two from the left we get a
limit equals three.
And the value of the function at that point is
also three.
Excellent.
, what about the second option when we approach two
from the right?
Does the limit exist there?
The limit of the function as x approaches two from
the right.
, the limit of the function.
So the limit, not the value, but the limit of
the function as x approaches two from the right does
exist.
However, it does not equal the value of the function
at that point, right?
Because the value of the function at this point is
three, but this limit is one.
Is this clear?
So that's why the answer to the.
That's why this option is wrong.
As most of you correctly, , correctly indicated.
Well, why is this function not continuous at the point
two?
Yes, please.
There's a gap.
In.
The.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
So that's very good indeed.
Because or in other words, because the limits don't match
exactly the limit of the function as x approaches two
from the left is not equal to the limit of
the function as x approaches two from the right.
So and for continuity.
At that point, we would need those limits to match
and to be equal to the value of the function
at that point.
Okay.
Very good.
So I can show you the, the the correct answer.
And we will have another question similar to these.
Well you have to think about the continuity and let's
start thinking about it and voting.
And then we'll discuss it together.
, so the voting has slowed down.
, it's still going on, but it's very slow.
So let's, , maybe let's let's start discussing this, ,
this question.
Okay.
So most of you, , said false, , meaning the
function is not continuous at the point x equals four.
, why why is that?
Why did you choose that answer anyone?
Just.
You can just.
Yes, please.
Very good indeed.
Indeed.
So the the the answer is because the function is
not defined at the point for sorry at the point
x equals four.
So let's recall again for continuity we need two things.
Well two things.
And one of those two things contains a little
sub thing.
So we need the limit at this point to exist.
And moreover we need the limit at that point to
equal the value of the function at that point which.
So the second condition requires the value of the function
at that point to exist as well.
Right.
So we need two things.
We need the limit to exist, and we need that
limit to match the value of the function.
But what if the function is not even defined at
that point?
Which which is the case in this on this picture?
We don't know what this function is.
We don't know what the algebraic expression looks .
And we don't care, because the graph tells us that
the function for some reason is not defined at that
point.
So we cannot even talk about continuity because, well, it's
just not defined at that point.
So which means that you choose the correct answer.
Very well done.
I'm afraid that's all the time we have for today.
Do you have if you have any questions about anything.
Come and ask otherwise.
See you next week.
Next.
Well, see you on Thursday.
