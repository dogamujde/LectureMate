Hello.
I think it's time to start.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for coming to the second lecture for cap.
So just before I start, just one admin thing.
If you need to have a change of group for
your workshops on the Tuesday, don't email myself, Chris or
Lily because this is not something we do and we
don't have the list.
Please email the course secretary whose name you will find
on the login page, and she will and she will
help you out.
Okay.
So do it quite quickly because if your clashes then
you can't come to the workshops.
And actually I think it's really beneficial that you do.
So as I said in the lecture on Monday.
Yeah Monday we carry on talking a little bit about
function and graphs today or actually not talking so much,
but more kind of looking at exercises.
Hopefully you have read the chapter of the book.
The parts of the first chapter of the book that
you had to read for today.
But we will also see something about Trig expressions and
we'll see something about logarithms.
So it's a little bit a mixed bag today.
Before we start, I just wanted to talk about domain
and range for one more minute, because I noticed in
the workshop when I was tutoring on on Tuesday, that
there was a little bit of confusion regarding this.
So the first thing I want to say is that
we don't really have a standard way to calculate the
domain of a function.
So there is no a procedure that you can apply,
right?
When we want to calculate the domain of the function,
the only thing that we can do is to look
at the function and try to understand when this is
not defined.
And that's really the only thing that we can do
that is not I do this and then I
do that and then I apply that.
There are very straightforward cases that we know when it
is square root.
We need to worry about whether what's under the square
root is positive.
When you have a denominator, you need to worry about
the denominator.
If you have a step function, then you need to
worry a little bit about how the step function defined.
In the example that I have up on the board.
Obviously this thing is only defined between minus infinity and
seven and ten and plus infinity.
So that would be the range.
But I could have had a more complicated function in
the definition of each one of the steps.
And if that had been the case then you would
have to worry also.
When is that defined?
Okay, so for a ray, this is why I think
it's really a good idea to try to acquire some
familiarity and understanding what the functions I'm dealing with look
.
So what type of function this is?
How do these families of function behave for the range?
We have a little bit more of a procedure.
So the range we calculate by looking at where.
In a way where in the domain of the function
I can find a y, right?
The way in which we think about is, at least
the way I think about it, is that if my
function is given by y equal f of x, which
is usually what we have, then I want to find
where there exists an x from which a y comes.
So I want to revert if you my process.
Instead of having something y equals f of x, I
want to have something x equal g of y.
And we know how to do this.
A kind of fairly simple algebraic manipulation which consists in
taking out the term x, and the place where that
g of is defined would be the range.
Now think about it.
If you think about the most simple quadratic function that
we know, which is the parabola.
, talk.
So if you think about this function, this is.
Y equals x squared okay.
What is the domain of this function.
I've given all the real numbers.
Do we agree that the domain of this function is
all the real numbers?
Yeah.
There's no reason why I could not stick any real
number in that function and get something out.
Great.
What is the range?
And.
Yep.
Aha.
Why?
X squared.
Negative.
Exactly.
So when I apply that way of thinking, I want
to reverse this in something that looks x equal.
Right.
And so this will be plus or minus square root
of y.
And this is obviously undefined when y is positive.
So you can see that the range is not the
domain.
And this process is quite easy with an easy function
this is a marginally more laborious for a, not
for a more laborious function.
But it is possible.
And this is the way we do it.
So it's a little bit of a more kind of
organised approach to this.
Okay.
So before too long let's start.
With our first question.
So we have seen in the worksheet on Tuesday that
we are starting playing with trigonometric trigonometric relationships.
So this is my question today.
For now I will give you three minutes.
Maybe if I find my watch.
Have a look.
If you can't quite see on the green of the
blue club.
This is reproduced in the slide, is the question.
So.
Oh my God.
Oh, no!
Oh!
No!
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
So we take a look at this.
So I think again we have quite a clear winner,
which is indeed the correct solution.
Does anybody know that?
So is there anybody that wants to tell me what
they used to find?
The second solution.
What?
Equality.
What trigonometric relationship did you use?
Anybody wants to volunteer?
Yep.
Cos that is equal to one.
Minus sine squared.
Absolutely.
That's.
So my rule of thumb with trigonometric expressions is that
when I need to change something, if in doubt try
to use sine squared x plus cos square x is
equal to one.
Because that usually takes us a long way.
It doesn't take us all the way in a lot
of the cases, but it takes us a long way.
So how do I go around thinking about the, ,
how to solve this problem?
Because to try to do the manipulations is not quite
enough, because you have you are giving me the, ,
the relationship in terms to cos.
And of course, because it's a square, there is a
plus or minus before it.
And so we need to know which, which part we
need to use.
And in order to do this we need to see
where sine and cosine when the sine minus one is
defined and what is positive and what is negative.
So these are the two things we need to use.
Obviously tan x is sine x over cos x.
And that's the other relationship that you mentioned.
This was the very straightforward thing.
I have an expression in tan.
So I try to take it in sine and cosine.
So then I need to think a little bit about
okay, I want to use that course.
Do I need to take the positive part or do
I need to take the negative part?
In order to do this, I need to think about
sign minus one.
Can you see that picture?
Maybe so.
Sign minus one is defined in minus pi over two.
Pi over two.
Forex between -1 and 1.
Right.
And the is positive for x in minus pi two
over two.
So we need to take the positive part right.
So we can't just decide that we need to kind
of have a little bit of a think about where
this sign minus x, that sign minus one x that
I want to to talk about.
And then.
We can write that expression for cosine minus x.
And we then put it in my original expression and
we obtain the solution.
So my the thing that you want to think
about when you do exercises of this type is that
the moment you use the sine squared x plus cos
square x is equal to one.
Unless you use it using the square, the square of
the Trig function, which is fine.
Sometimes we will use it that way.
You need to think about sine okay.
And you need to reason about the function that you're
looking at.
So in this case this is what the solution
that we obtain.
So B is correct.
So excellent.
Are there any questions.
I'm not going to ask all the time.
So if you have a question just ask.
Just take your hands up and ask okay.
What do we want to do next.
Let's have a look.
Oops.
So this is a okay.
That was quick.
Come.
Oh.
Okay.
I think we can stop here.
I think that there is an overwhelming answer.
So anybody that wants to tell me how they found
out.
Yep.
Yes.
, which is also to say that if you compose
the two functions from the right and then from the
left, you need to obtain the same function.
Okay.
Generally, when we have inverse of a function type exercises
of this sort, we do the composition on one way,
the composition on the other way.
If I get, because we have seen last week that
the composition of function is not commutative the product
of real numbers, for example.
So if I get the same results, then they are
one, the inverse of the other and the working out
is here.
In fact, again, if you just wanted to sketch the
two functions, you could have seen this from the graph
as well.
This is why I said it's really important to try
to have an idea of how functions work, and how
I can sketch them on the real numbers.
There were quite a bit of exercises on the worksheet
for the week about sketching graphs.
At the moment we are doing it with a little
bit of intuition.
Later on in the course we will talk about limits.
We will talk about asymptotes.
We will talk about derivatives which allow us to to
find maximum, minimum and so on.
But for now we just use a little bit of
intuition in our work.
In this case it was very easy because I have
two straight lines so I can plot those.
And if you do the composition you get.
You get that?
The other thing that you should have checked, and I
just assume that you know this because, you know, this
stuff is that the functions have inverse.
We have also seen, I think, last week, the not
all functions of an inverse.
In this case they do write linear functions.
They do so before we just this is just to
say that before we go into the straightforward algebraic
manipulation, we really need to think a little bit about
what you are doing, the functions you are dealing with,
and whether certain things exist and whether I can do
certain things.
Okay, so this was easy.
Let's see another one.
Oh, my.
God.
Wow.
Okay.
That's excellent.
100% response.
Can somebody who bought it.
Tell me what they did?
How did you find the solution?
Yep.
Come on.
By the inverse function of log base two log logarithmic
functions.
1 to 1.
And then apply the inverse constant.
Yeah.
Wait.
Wait.
This is complicated.
Can you say it in here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So because.
Because log base two is a 1 to 1 function,
, you can apply the inverse, , raise two to
the power of both sides.
, and then similarly you can apply the inverse to
the function x plus four because that's 1 to 1
by subtracting four from both sides.
And that gives you x equals four.
Yeah.
So this is one way of doing another way of
doing it.
Yes.
Good.
By the way one more way of doing this.
What could we have done.
I think I can think at least one more way.
Later.
Who wants to tell me another way of doing of
doing this?
No, because it's the two functions, right.
So we could sketch the log function.
The function.
The constant function equal to three.
Where these two functions intersect is the answer to our
questions.
So if I wanted to recap what am I doing?
So we can do exactly what your colleague said.
So we can use logarithm properties and just unpack this
function in this way.
Or we can draw the graph.
I mean we can draw the log graph.
I think it's fairly easy to do.
X equal three is a straight line parallel to the
x axis that cuts the y axis at the point
three.
And where this intersect is the solution.
This is something which is important to remember, right?
When we talk about solution of equation we have this
equation equal to this other equation.
We have a lot of algebraic ways of of dealing
with this by taking stuff from one side or applying
logarithm or whatever.
But what that means is that you are looking for
the points of intersections of these two curves.
And this is something which is useful to remember because
when you don't really quite know what to do, then
maybe you can sketch a graph, and then you can
get an idea of how to go around with things.
In this case, it was really pretty, pretty easy.
As I said, the log function is really not very
difficult to to sketch, and that's just a constant function.
Okay.
Let's see whether I can give you a more difficult
one.
For you to.
Oh.
Hi.
I'm.
That's.
Okay.
So what do I need to know in order to
be able to solve questions of this type?
So what do I what are the things I use?
What do we think?
Come on.
I need to remember the log rules.
This is really the only thing I need to know.
So I need to remember the sum, the products, the
quotient of logarithms, and what else in this?
In this case, what is the other slightly tricky issue
here?
Yep.
Yeah.
There's a change of base because the two logarithm on
the right hand side are natural logarithm.
This means a logarithm to the base e, whilst the
other logarithm is in base seven.
How many of you remembered all the log rules before
they read the book for today?
Show of hands.
Well that's interesting.
I'm not going to put my hand up because I
did not remember them, but it's something that actually is
really kind of very useful to have when we do
exercise of this sort.
So I know that it's a bit boring to try
to remember this formula, but we need them.
So go in the book and look at the map.
Or we can look at them here as well.
So how do I solve that problem?
I need to remember how to do the change of
base.
So the first thing that I need to think about
is that before I can calculate anything this, everything
needs to be in the same base.
So what I'm trying to do there, I'm trying to
bring anything to the base E and then I can,
, I can solve my, my problem.
What are the formula for the logarithm that we really
want to remember?
I have put them up here.
They are all in your book.
So generally, , what we, what we want to know
is the logarithm of the product or the quotient or
the power, and also of the change of base.
So make sure that you remember this formula that you
know how to use them.
Make sure that when you solve problems involving logarithms Rhythms.
All your kind of things are in order.
The bases are all the same.
And you're not doing, , not allowed.
, operations.
Also, remember the, , the, , sketch of the logarithm
function?
That could be very, very useful.
You mentioned the logarithm function is 1 to 1, which
is true.
So that's also something which is useful to remember okay.
This means that the logarithm function is both injective and
subjective.
Okay.
Let's see next one.
Oh!
My.
God!
Oh!
My.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Thank you.
It's not the same for GPS.
, they are not saying because she is only x.
Here is x minus one.
Oh, gosh.
Yes.
Sorry, guys.
There is a typo in my slides.
Thank you.
All of them.
Before.
Before I post them online of course the g should
be g x equal to one.
Thanks.
Right.
Sorry I can't even copy the text of a question.
So how many of you have.
.
Well, okay.
What do we think is false?
Yep.
F of x x can be equal to one.
I know, but I can unpack the product and then
I can simplify.
To one.
Right.
Yeah exactly.
So if you say well this question these functions are
the same because I can unpack that product that that
numerator that is x x minus one.
And I said then I can divide by x minus
one.
And then they are the same.
And then you can say to this person well actually
you can only do that when x is not one
right.
So you can do it but you can't do it.
You cannot do it always.
So if I really, really want it to be picky,
I would say that these are always the same.
But in that one point, well, one is not defined.
So be very careful when you do all these algebraic
manipulations.
Right.
Because behind a lot of the algebraic manipulation there are
things that we need to find out.
In this case the idea is that this function cannot
be the same because they don't have the same domain,
right?
They have nearly the same domain, but for one point,
and therefore they're not the same.
So think about the fact that the function is not
just the algebraic expression, but the function is the algebraic
expression, the domain and the range.
And so if I wanted to.
To look at this I will say it's this way.
So the the operation I can I can divide cannot
happen always.
So watch out for this right.
Also watch out for this when you simplify algebraic expression
which are functions.
Okay let's do let's do next one.
What.
Do you remember about even an odd functions.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
I'm sorry to answer your.
Question.
What's.
The first thing.
You.
Okay, so all the information, who can give me a
definition of a nod function?
When do I say that the function is odd?
Do you remember?
When is the function odd?
No volunteers.
If there is no volunteers, I'm going to have to
ask you again.
What is functional for all?
I guess for all x on the domain f of
minus x equals minus f of x.
Exactly.
So we talk about all the given functions.
This is the definition of odd functions in a minute
in.
On the slides we will also see the definition of
an even function.
And the definition of an odd function is that a
function of at or default is if for every x
in the domain, the function is not defined outside the
domain, so I don't really care.
Well, nothing happens outside the domain because the function is
not there.
So when you write these things, you need to write
them properly.
So don't just write for me for every x.
This happens because it's only for every x in the
domain.
Because if the domain doesn't happen to be the order
of the real numbers, the function doesn't exist.
And so I cannot say what happens.
So when you write this stuff, write it properly.
So we say that for every x in the domain
I need to find that f of minus x is
equal to minus f of x.
Does it happen here?
Yeah it does.
And we can say.
Right.
So this function is odd.
Who can give me a definition of an even function.
Well when a function is even.
Yep.
Even function.
Is when f of negative x is equal to
f of.
X.
Excellent.
So an even function is when f of minus x
is equal to f of x.
Can anybody give me an example of an even function
from the top of the head x squared?
Exactly.
So because for an even function I want to see
that f of x is equal to f of minus
x.
Let me just bring up my slides.
Then the obvious thing to think about is a function
that has got only even exponents for the for the
unknown.
Okay, in this case I've got a cubic, I've got
the sorry parabola, but I could have had x to
the four plus x squared -72 and that would have
been the same.
And in this case this is my graph of an
even function.
So I think we've got one more question to go
for today which is quite different in type.
So no more functions on graphs.
This course is called calculus and its applications.
So there you.
Are.
So.
1.5.
So I'm going to give you five minutes to do
this.
Okay.
So.
One.
How?
Do we assume.
That leap years aren't a thing?
Yeah.
Forget the boatlift years.
Okay.
This is an interesting question.
I've just been asked.
I would just say forget about leap years.
Okay.
So let's do a bit of mathematical modelling, and let's
assume that all years have the same number of days.
After five years.
After five years.
After five years.
Which one?
Yeah.
So when I log into, can I take a look
at that?
Okay.
Come on.
We have a few more boats in, and then we'll
talk about this.
There is still.
66 people that are logged in but haven't bought it.
So come on, a few more boats and then we
have a little bit of a of a conversation about
what is that we are doing with this question.
Getting worse.
Okay.
So I think.
I think that that is as much as I can
get people to vote.
So somebody that voted.
So okay, first of all, I can see that there
are two solutions which have been voted.
Don't get influenced by everybody else, both.
If you think it's something else, just vote for something
else.
Okay.
This is also a kind of a learning curve.
But having said that, obviously the most voted solution is
the right one.
And then we are also going to go and see
why the the other one is not right.
So who wants to tell me how they found the
solution.
What kind of stuff they used.
I'm looking at the back.
No.
No.
I mean.
I don't know.
It's just the power is the number of.
You you have to say to you.
Okay.
Sorry.
Because there are loads of us in here.
Yeah.
Hello?
Okay.
The power is the number of days that the
interest is applied for.
And then in the bracket is , , so you've
got the 3000, and then you times that by the
amount of interest, I don't know.
I'm not sure how to , describe it, but it's
, that's the money gained and then you
times it by the amount of days.
Kinda.
I'm not sure how to explain that.
No.
That's cool.
No, that's a good explanation.
I have one more question for somebody else.
So why do I have an exponent with the number
of days?
Yep.
Yeah, I can organise.
I can say.
It's compound interest.
So it's exponential.
Yeah it's discrete.
Right.
Because the interest is calculated at one point each day.
And this is why you have the number of days.
So let's have a a written down solution of
this problem.
Thank you.
That was great.
Yeah.
So there we are.
This is the formula that I need to use to
calculate compound interest.
And in this formula which is the same one which
is in your book somewhere, which I don't remember in
the, in the chapter I have this value.
So a is the value of the Of the investment
after the time.
So this is what I want to calculate, right?
To have a sum of money I invested under certain
condition.
I want to find out how much capital do I
have after a certain period of time.
P is the initial capital that is invested.
In our case it was £3,000 and then I have
one.
Plus R is the interest rate and is the time
unit.
In our case we want to calculate over a year.
So I have 365 days in the year.
Forget about leap year.
We have done just some mathematical modelling here okay.
And then t is the time after which I want
to know the value of the investment.
So in this case I have £3,000.
I invest in them with the interest of 5%.
I get this every year.
I want to know how much.
So it's a question of calculating this formula for the
data that we are that we have the thing which
was interesting and we had to think about, or at
least what I did this exercise I had to think
about for a moment is why I'm not using the
last formula.
So the the A and the C are kind of
red herrings.
So they're just there.
But the last one is a proper formula.
The last one is the formula to give compound interest
to.
Yeah.
To calculate this.
A equal p e to the RT.
And this is only given if the interesting compound it
continuously.
So this is the difference between calculating the interest at
each day and calculating the interest continuously.
And the trick of if you of the of
the question.
Not the trick, but the thing that maybe we had
to think about for one moment was to try and
understand whether this was an interest calculated continuously, or were
interest calculating discreetly.
So every every week, every year.
Every day.
Okay.
So I think that this is all what I have
for you today.
I can only encourage you.
Please come to the workshops on Tuesday.
