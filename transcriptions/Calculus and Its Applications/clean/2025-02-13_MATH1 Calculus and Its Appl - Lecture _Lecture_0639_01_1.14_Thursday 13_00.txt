Okay.
Good afternoon.
So today we carry on thinking about integrals and we
will see some other applications of integrals.
Not next week is an independent learning week, but the
week after we will see even more applications of integrals.
But today I think that the main point that we
want to talk about is this idea of the Riemann
sums.
So let's have a look what we can say.
So we have had conversations about how historically the integral
came about, because we wanted to calculate the area between
a curve and the x axis.
And we also said that we did this by approximation.
Originally we wanted to approximate, if you , the area
one is a little bit less and one is a
little bit more, and then we do a limiting process
to see what happens.
So this idea is what is behind this idea of
the Riemann sums.
The in your textbook on page five and 19 the
Riemann sums are defined on a.
So if I have a closed interval a and b
and p is a regular partition of MP, f is
defined on this closed interval, then the delta x is
the width of each subinterval.
And I define the Riemann sum as that as the
sum for I that goes one to an f of
x I star delta x I.
The thing.
The only thing that we need to take care when
we do exercises involving the Riemann sums, is to really
understand who all these symbols are.
So in the case of the formula, The xy star
is a point in the interval x I minus 1XI.
A is a regular partition, and we said last time
that the regular partition means that A is partitioned in
segments which are all the same length, right?
So for each segment the length x I minus 1XI
minus x I minus one is the same for each
I.
That's what it means to be a regular partition.
And then we define delta x to be one over
n b minus a.
And we can do that because this is a regular
partition okay.
So all the n segments have the same length.
This is the the definition which is in your book.
Now if and and we can talk about Riemann sums
for functions in general.
What we want to say is that if x is
continuous and non-negative in a b, then and that is
the Riemann sum for for f, then the area under
the curve is the limit of that sum that defines
the limit sum.
So basically I am saying that if f of x
is positive, you remember why I say it is positive.
Because last time we saw what happens if x if
the function is under the x axis, we need to
do something about it.
We'll see more about this next week.
But so if f is positive, then I say that
the area is the limit for the goes to infinity
of that sum.
So this is all more or less what there is
to know about Riemann sums.
And let us see whether we can do some questions.
Let me just.
There you are.
Oh come on.
Ah, excellent.
So let's see whether we can do some questions.
Some of them will concern Riemann sums.
The first ones will concern some applications of integrals.
And so let's do this one.
Please log in and then let me switch it off.
Well that's interesting.
17.
Oh!
Oh!
So you are right.
Why not?
Okay, a few more people want to vote.
For me.
Okay.
Let's see.
We are nearly there.
There are in my car.
In the calculation of Woohoo club, there are 113 33
people logged in.
I've got 115 replies.
I think I can be happy with that.
There are hundred and 34 now.
Okay, so somebody that speaks to me in favour of
the fact that.
That somebody that goes with the general consensus that that
is false.
Somebody that can tell me why this is the case
or what they think is the case.
So.
I'm not looking at you, but you can say if
you want.
No.
So what do we think?
Why is that the case?
That's on top of the business problem.
Yep.
Excellent.
Can I it's false.
You can.
Yep.
Basically because you have to integrate twice, you have a
constant that you can't find.
Exactly.
So what is happening here?
I have something which so in a kind of this
is not in a formal way.
We would see the formal, the, the formal solution of
the exercise in a minute.
But the way in which we think about this exercise
is, is the following.
I have yes, I am given the acceleration a of
t, and I am given one condition.
I'm given the velocity at the origin to be zero.
Now, the way I think about the acceleration is this.
Variation, the change of space with respect to time
is the velocity and the change of velocity with respect
to time is acceleration.
So I am doing two derivatives here right?
If you start from your space, this means that I
need to have two conditions in order to be able
to find out exactly what is the point that I'm
looking for.
In this case, I've got only one.
I only know what happens in v equal zero.
So ideally I would to know what happens in
the s of zero.
So in the initial moment where is in the space
the point and so on.
This is a way an intuitive way of thinking
about this, which is exactly what you were saying.
Now if I wanted to write this down properly and
don't forget intuition is very important.
But ultimately we need to be able to write down
things in mathematical language.
How would I write this down?
I would say, okay.
I know that a of t is dv dt, and
so v of t is the integral of t.
And this is an indefinite Integral and the solution contains
an arbitrary constant.
We have seen this last time, right?
Now I cannot find this contrast, this constant.
And in fact, suppose that I take these two, these
80 equal equal t square plus one.
So I choose an 80.
And for an for v of zero we have c
one equal to one.
But I could just choose another function.
Which has the same properties with a different constant.
And I would find that the point is in a
different place.
So this is the idea right?
The data in my in my exercise are not enough
to be able to tell me exactly what is the
point at the time.
T.
And and you can show if you had the question
this, you could argue first intuitively to say that
I am doing two derivatives now, but you could also
show it in this way by showing a control example
and say, well, I have this function that satisfies the
properties, and I have this function and the points end
up in different places.
So what you need to do, you need to take
functions with different constants.
Okay.
So this is the this is often a good way
to think about questions this.
So if you want to show that something is false
produced an example where that is false okay.
And that will be enough.
Or of course you can reason cannot deductively from what
we know from mathematics, but sometimes showing an example.
So if I ask you, is this true?
You can tell me, no, it is not true because
there is two functions that have the same behave
the exercise wants them to behave, and yet the
position of points end up being different.
Let's do one more.
Okay, but I am going to switch this off because
it's more fun when we don't see the results.
Is this the right one?
Yeah.
Yep.
So this.
Is.
Oh.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Let's have one more minute.
Just a few more people to vote.
And then we have a look.
Back.
Okay.
Wait.
There we are.
So I am somewhat delighted that nobody picked two.
Why?
Two is wrong.
Who can tell me why?
Two is totally wrong and we are not even thinking
about it.
So why is not the average velocity in one minute?
Yep.
Sorry I was looking past you.
Because by integrating velocity, we're going to get distance or
displacement.
If you wanted the average, you would have to divide
Bye bye.
Yeah.
Bye.
Yeah.
So that's definitely not.
I also don't want to say the four is correct
because there is four is not correct because there is
a right answer there.
So why do we think the majority of the people
that have voted between 3 and 1 think that that
is the total distance in one minute?
Why do we think that?
And why is not this distance from the starting point?
.
Because of the because of the modulus.
There's no, , so because of the modulus, there's no,
, direction.
So it's just, , it'd be measuring speed, which
is.
Exactly.
Just got magnitude.
Exactly.
So this is exactly a point.
And this is something that is important to keep in
mind when you read questions.
Just try to think about things out there.
In this case, why do I get a module right.
Why do I want the model of V of T.
Because that is, the total distance of the sprinter is
not the distance from the starting point.
So if I wanted to formalise this, what would I
say?
So C.
Would be the distance the displacement in one minute and
therefore would have no module.
you were saying just now.
Right.
Whilst B for the average velocity I would have to
divide by 16 number of seconds in a minute or
some unit, but the average implies some sort of account
of average.
So you need to know what you have divided the
length of the in this.
In this case I think the time division of your
time unit okay.
Therefore what we need is the total distance of the
sprinter in one minute.
So next one.
Wait.
A.
Minute.
, there's no unit.
That's all right this minute.
That's fine.
Just a minute.
Yeah.
Why not?
Why not?
So when you have questions this, just think about.
So this is obviously a question about the rate of
change of something.
Okay.
So think about what is changing and in which direction
is the change.
Is there any more clear.
All.
Right.
Are.
There any.
Other questions?
that.
Thank you for that.
Okay, let's have a look.
Okay, so that's pretty.
Pretty much a big vote of confidence for the first
question.
So what?
The reason why I say some I said what I
said before is because in this case, we need to
think about that.
Is the volume of water inside the tank, which is
whatever this water is, which is changing.
Right.
And the amount of water in the tank is negative.
So the change will be negative.
It's not the case of a velocity that's increasing.
In this case the change is decreasing.
So why.
That is the answer.
Who can tell me why that's the answer.
And then we will see why the other ones cannot
cannot be the answer.
What do we think.
Why the change is given by the integral.
Right Thank you.
Yeah.
What?
Oh.
Yes.
Sorry.
It's a big room.
Not very quick.
Okay.
So why is that integral?
The function that we're given measures the rate of, ,
water falling out, or the rate at which water falls
out of the, , pipe.
And to measure the actual amount of, , the amount
of water that has fallen out of the pipe.
, we'll need to integrate it because, , integrating it
will give us the function of just how much water
has been or all has come out of the pipe.
So would you be able to say why?
For example, the second one is not right.
If you don't want to say it, just say no.
But because that just gives you.
.
Actually, what does that give you?
That's all right.
I can show.
You.
Okay, so this is of course, correct what you said.
So let's have a look why that is true and
why the rest is not.
Ah.
So.
First of all, thank you to the comments that one
of your colleagues gave.
I have ignored units or measures here, which is very
sloppy of me.
The time should have some unit of measure.
Okay.
In the context of this exercise, it doesn't really matter,
but just for good mathematical writing.
That should be the case.
Okay, so let's have a look at what happens.
So.
Sorry.
This is the formalisation of what you were saying before
right.
What I am looking at is the rate of change
of the water coming out of wherever the water was.
And I want to calculate this.
So the change of volume of the water is decreasing,
okay.
Because the water is coming out of whatever, whatever it
was.
And so I can say that the water collected between
two times, which is called DBC.
So the water collected between the times one and the
time two.
I don't know how you want to call them would
be given by that.
And by the net change theorem we have that integral.
Okay.
So this is pretty straightforward.
The only thing that we had to think about when
we have Problems of this sort.
We want to think about the modelling, what is
actually happening.
They are not all the same.
This is fun.
Let's do this one.
I just don't.
Understand why.
Not exactly a.
Year from.
Now.
Yeah.
Okay.
So we have a look.
So this exercise is once you understand how to apply
the formula, are all about understanding who are the main
character in that formula.
So are questions.
Okay.
So why is that the answer?
Let's have a look at this worked out properly.
Oops.
So this is the formula that we use right.
For the approximation of the area under the curve.
And we have seen this in the introduction.
This is Riemann sums.
So in order to do exercises this I just
need to really understand what is that x.
Who is f of x I, I would suggest when
you do exercises involving the Riemann, the Riemann sums, that
you make yourself a kind of a table of who
are all these, these things.
So in my case f of x is my function,
is e to the x and the interval where I
want to calculate the approximation is zero three okay.
Delta x in this case is three to the n
is three over n.
Because on the top I would have to have b
minus a by a.
In this case is equal to zero is the origin
and so is three over n and x I.
Where will be a plus delta x times y is
three over n delta x times I.
Once you have sorted this out then you know the
formula.
And this is exactly the answer.
Okay, so this exercise is once you kind of have
your understanding that I am doing an approximation of area,
and I calculate the approximation in this way.
There are really all about understanding who the delta x
the xi the extremes are.
So I want to do another one this that
we are going to be.
It's going to be really fun.
So what about this one?
Why is he doing that?
I don't know.
How?
But.
I.
Just.
Want.
To take.
Yes.
Okay.
I need a few more votes.
Come on.
Not a lot of people voted.
For you.
Okay, let's have a look because I've got other questions
I want to to see.
So the answer is of course four.
So my first question is what are these expressions then.
And what do they tell me the same thing.
Can anybody tell me what are these two expressions.
Somebody that bought it both needs to have an idea
of what this expression represents.
What are they.
Going to.
What?
Why?
They're both.
They're both the same thing.
Well, the difference is that the second includes the zero
term and the first doesn't.
And the zero term will equal to zero, so the
sum doesn't.
So we call them the limit using the right
hand point and the limit using the left hand point.
So if you have read your chapter about , for
today, you will, you will have seen that I can
write the Riemann sum using the right hand point or
the left hand point.
So I start from different places a little bit.
So the picture you need to have in your head,
which is not the true representation of what is going
on, it's just an image to to help you is
the same thing as if I wanted to calculate an
area.
Of something this.
And I couldn't do integrals.
I could go from the bottom.
Yeah.
And then approximate.
Or I could overshoot.
That's the picture.
So you go from both sides.
Now this is not quite what happened with the Riemann
sums, but the idea is the same.
So this represents the same thing.
So let's have a look at what they represent.
The same thing.
How do I calculate them.
And so on.
First of all one point about what the exercise is
asking you.
So despite the fact that we have said that historically,
we think about Riemann sums to calculate areas under curves.
The exercise is not asking you for an area.
Right.
Would you agree with me?
So in this case the outcome of this limit may
be negative and that would be fine.
It's when you have an integral which is negative.
We will see next week a little bit more in
details.
Else.
But we have also mentioned this is on Monday.
When you are requested to find an area, then you
need to think about the sign.
When you are requested to calculate some integral or some
limit and so on.
Then we take whatever sign that comes.
But just to show you.
That curve.
Looks this.
So that's the function that we have in the integral.
And that is the what it looks .
And it has a minimum there.
Yeah.
And you said no.
If I had asked you for the area, then my
thinking would be different because there is a part of
the curve which is under the x axis.
So I would have to think about the sine of
that.
But this exercise is only asking you for the limit
of the Riemann sum.
It's if I was asking you for the integral
between 0 and 4 of that curve.
But in any case, I think it is sure was
positive to try to make yourself a picture.
Even if you want to go on Desmos and ask
Desmos to make yourself a picture.
So don't want to work out maximum, minimum, and so
on.
Which is useful because you will do this later on
in the course.
But so this is my function.
Now suppose that I want to calculate the using rate
and points okay.
When I use right hand points by convention I start
my sums from one.
So I say that my integral is the limit of
I that goes from one to n of that expression.
If you go in with all the items that we
have seen before, this is exactly what you get.
And the limit is calculated by finding what the by
knowing what the sum for I to n of a
I square m from I from one to n on
I is.
You should know these things from school, but we will
have also.
There will be a unit later on which is about
things this.
So that is my calculation.
So then I go and solve that limit.
And sorry, I'm not quite sure what's happened.
And that's what I find.
Okay fine.
We know about limits.
We've done it last week.
So this is what they found.
Now suppose that I am not satisfied.
And I want you to calculate the Riemann sum from
the left hand.
From the left hand point.
Okay.
If I wanted to do that, then that sum would
start from zero and would be the sum from I
from zero to n minus one.
Now what is the thing I need to to be
one minute?
Careful if I want to do this calculation.
I mean I can plug in the formula I
did before.
I've got the delta X and all this kind of
stuff.
Well I don't know what that is.
What do I need to be careful about.
What do you think?
Yep.
Is it that.
The function needs to be continuous?
Otherwise the right and left endpoints won't approximate to the
same thing?
Yes, but we know that the function is continuous because
we actually have the the actual expression of the function.
Right.
Yeah.
In this not in this case, but there is a
general consideration I need to think about.
Well, no, but a little bit more general than that,
but not completely general.
What could that be?
Okay.
So but if you want to apply this formula and
you wanted to calculate the the other Riemann sum.
Okay.
This is the something that I said before.
And obviously when we do this exercise, it's actually it's
always a good idea to go and check.
Take one minute to do this integral, okay?
And if your limit is different from this integral then
you need to worry about.
But in this case it's fine.
That's the limit.
Now what I want to draw your attention on is
that in order to calculate this limit, I have put
into my expression the value of the sum for.
I then goes from to n I and I square.
These sums are calculated in.
In order to have that sum, the the index needs
to go from one to n.
So what happens if the index goes from zero to
n minus one.
So you cannot just plug this in when you calculate
the left hand side the left point right.
You need to think about what happens to the sum.
And it's not too difficult actually to think about this
because what you do.
Is this you take the formula that you know, when
you have the sum from from one to n and
you replace n minus one instead of n, because this
time your sum in between 0 and -1 and the
formula slightly changes, as you can see there.
So in the in the first two formulas you replace
n minus n with n minus one.
You obtain the formulas at the bottom, and then these
are the formulas you use to put in the limits
to calculate the left hand points.
So to recap, when we do exercises of this sort
and you look at summations on the natural numbers, the
point where you start and the point where you stop
are important.
So if you just replace in the left hand point
calculation, the sum, the value of the sum from one
to n, you would have been a bit in trouble.
But if you do this, then you can do all
your calculations.
I've done them.
It works.
You take exactly the same value, which is what you
wanted, because you are taking a limit from basically from
an overshoot and an undershoot of some approximation.
Okay.
I think we have time for one more.
Let's have a look.
What time is it?
Oh.
Gosh.
Yes.
Quickly.
Very quickly.
Let's try to do this.
We got four minutes.
Okay.
So in the last minute and a half of the
lecture because then I need to let you go.
We have said in the course of commenting on the
exercise before that that must be true.
Right.
That two expressions limits to the same value, because the
two expressions, the limit of that expression under the right
conditions, of course, the function is continuous and is defined
in the integral in the interval and all that.
The limit is the integral and the integral is one
integral.
So these two limiting processes needs to to be going
to the same place.
So it doesn't matter in the end.
If I go right and point to the left hand
point, if I then take the limit, because that is
going to give me the integral.
Okay.
So I'll see, you know, independent learning week next week.
Right.
So see you Monday Monday next week.
All.
Oh.
Okay.
So.
Oh, wait.
We can always, .
Wait wait wait.
Wait wait wait.
We can always, , , interview as, , for me
as a form of submission.
So, , so you guys, the reason is, .
So.
When we calculate the stream of funds, we find the
songs that have known songs.
Right?
So then it's interesting to see how this changes people
in the rest of the world, because the approximation is
quite different.
The price of this is not just to raise awareness,
they just use that term.
And if you have different information and I mean, in
this particular exercise, because of the function that it will
give the points and the intervals.
The theorem works out that we use these two sums,
but there may be others.
They use other things.
Okay.
It is just something to show that there needs to
be room for all of it.
That's okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh.
Hello there.
, so this one was very nice for everybody, but.
I think not.
The whole, of course, is the result.
Okay.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Okay.
