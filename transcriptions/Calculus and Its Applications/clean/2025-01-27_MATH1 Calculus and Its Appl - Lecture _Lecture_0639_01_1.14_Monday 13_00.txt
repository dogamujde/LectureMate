Good morning and welcome to week three.
Hi.
So before we start today, I want to give a
shout out.
I want to give a shout out to Matt's pulse.
So much.
Pulse is a support for students, especially for Cap and
for PPS.
And these are your fellow students in further years down
the line.
That will help you with any questions that you may
have.
They are the details.
That's the QR code.
I will put this PDF on the learn page so
you can kind of access it and have a look
at the QR code in later on.
I would strongly recommend you take support when you need
it.
So don't wait for two weeks before the exam to
think, oh my god, I never understood derivatives, But take
all the supports that you can get.
We have workshops.
You have math pals that you can access at these
dates and and hours in the at the.
At the King building house.
So do don't just sit there and think I cannot
do this.
I mean, if I think back when I was a
first year student, which isn't quite yesterday, I think I
could have done with all the supports that I could
have got.
And so you have a lot of things that you
can access.
So please do if you need them.
Okay.
So this is week three.
Is there anybody that can volunteer me a quick recap
of what you did last week.
Given that I wasn't here.
Anybody that wants to tell me what you did last
week.
Not much.
Oh, limits.
So do you want to say three words about limits?
Wait wait wait.
Hey, I'm in the mic.
Oh I know.
Come on.
Limits from both sides.
From the right and left.
, we checked if they exist and.
Stuff.
Okay, let.
Me see about that.
Can anybody else add to this?
A show of hand if you think you have seen
continuity of functions.
Excellent.
So today we are going to get on a little
bit on this idea of limits and continuity.
And we are going to talk about derivatives.
As I often as I always do when I teach,
I just want to have a couple of slides, five
minutes to recap on the things which are really important
on the chapter that you should have read for today,
not that the rest is not important.
Everything is important, but these are things that other students
As I know the student fund difficult or that is
really important to remember.
So let's see what these are.
So the derivative at a point to a curve is
the slope of the tangent line to that curve at
that point.
Now if you want to think about the all the
derivatives one curve with every point where is the derivative
exists.
You could think about a family of straight lines that
varies as the point varies on the curve.
I'm not going to bring up Desmos now, but I've
made you an animation that can show you this
tangent line that moves along a curve as the point
moves along the curve, and we think about the tangent
line, or sometimes we think about the tangent line as
if I have two points that intersect, say a second
degree curve as these two points get very close.
The line which is defined by these two points gets
very close to the tangent line.
Okay.
So.
Don't forget that for a tangent we need the curve
and the point.
We also know because we should know this because you
have read it in in the chapter for today that
I can think about the derivative as a rate of
change.
So you can see how I can think about the
same mathematical objects in different ways.
So I can think of an object in a geometrical
way, if you , which is this idea of
going to see the tangent line to the curve.
But I can think about the derivative also in an
analytical way, if you , which is the process and
the definition of the derivative, which we'll see in a
minute.
But I can also think in more, I want to
say applied terms as the derivative as a rate of
change.
And we will have a couple of exercises questions in
book club today to see how we can think about
the derivative as the rate of change.
The things which are important to think about.
The derivative is a function in itself, right?
So this function may in itself have a derivative or
may not have a derivative, will have a range and
will have a domain.
So in order to think about derivatives and say oh
I want to calculate the derivative.
And then I want to calculate the second degree derivative.
Each time you need to think about this object that
you have in front of you as a function.
And so you need to go in and check whether
actually the second derivative exists given the first derivative and
all these things.
So the fact that the function has a first derivative
doesn't really mean that the second or third the fourth
derivative will will exist.
Each each derivative is a function in itself.
So the calculation of the first derivative involves limits.
How do I calculate this while I take an increment
of a function which is usually of an x that
which usually is h.
I will put the formula up in one of my
exercises, and we see what happens when this increment becomes
smaller and smaller and smaller.
Now, what is the idea here?
The idea is that a derivative exists to know if
a derivative exists.
I need to think about limits.
Right.
So my question does the derivative at this point to
this curve exists kind of bounces back as a question
about limits.
And we will see what are the conditions by which
the derivative exists and what is the relative limit.
All the rules that we studied at school as rules.
I have one I've got one up there just as
a as an example are derived by applying the definition
of the derivative.
My first principle there I have an example where I
want to calculate the derivative of the second degree curve.
Obviously you look at it and you say okay that's
two x plus three, but why is it two x
plus three?
We studied the formula for polynomials, but that's actually showing
from first principle y that is the derivative to the
polynomial.
So you need to think about it behind all these
formulas that you know there are sometimes really complex applications
of that one formula on the board.
So what else?
Okay.
I, , let's see whether this works.
So.
Excellent.
Okay.
Today we are going to do something slightly different from
what we did in week one with me.
I'm not sure what you did lightly.
I'm going to let you log in on this question.
So please everybody log in.
And then I'm going to switch off the screen with
a hook up question on.
So you don't see what is the majority vote to
that question.
Shall we try.
I'm just going to switch it off.
You have the question there.
Okay.
So everybody logs in.
I've got only I think.
Yeah.
Okay.
Any more.
It's more than 157 people in here.
Come on.
Okay.
I am going to switch this off.
And I will leave you to vote.
You have got the text in there anyway.
Actually, next time what I should put, I should do.
I should put the QR code in that slide.
Okay.
I'm going to give you five minutes.
This requires a moment of thinking this question.
Oh that's exciting.
You can't see the majority vote.
Oh, I.
Oh.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank.
You.
Jesus.
Christ.
Jesus.
What?
Do you do?
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, oh.
Don't.
Say.
Amazing.
Great.
Okay.
Do we need one more minute?
Who would to have one more minute to think
about this?
Okay.
So we have a look.
Let's have a look.
You.
Are excellent.
So this is about, , the, .
I mean, I'm happy to say that a lot of
people thought that the right question was the right question,
, the right answer was the right answer.
So that is indeed the right answer.
And we will go through how we get this answer
and a little bit more things around it in a
minute.
But does anybody want to explain who bought it for
me, want to explain to me why they voted for
B?
What did I do?
I'm going to come up here.
No.
I should really bring the other mic with me, but
never mind.
Next time.
Found the change in the or the the height at
the two times at one second and 1.5 seconds and
then found the change in the height.
, well, specifically did the height at 1.5 seconds minus
the height of one second divided by the difference in
times is 0.5 seconds.
Yep.
Okay.
Let's have a look at this a little bit more.
, come formally on the board if you .
Okay.
So as our colleague up there was saying, this is
exactly what we do, right?
So we try to we start by calculated to find
the average velocity.
We need to calculate the displacement over time.
And the displacement is the basically the length of the
segment h1 h of one h of 1.5 divided
the time, which is that?
And then I find my solution.
Now let's think about this for one more moment, if
that's okay.
So I could do this for a lot of the
segments between the heights that I'm given.
So for example, if I want to do it on
one and 1.1, I obtain the first expression on one
and 1.0, one the second expression, and so on.
I want to ask what is the limit of this
expression as the interval becomes smaller and smaller?
What would this limit give me?
Why am I asking what is this limit apart from
the fact that we've done limit last week?
So it's good to exercise.
Any taker.
Oh, that's not true.
No, wait Instantaneous.
Instantaneous velocity.
Sorry.
You were too far away.
I will come.
Do you want to say something?
Oh, okay.
Wait.
Not this.
I cannot hear you.
Nobody else can hear you.
This is better than going to the gym.
So you wanted to say something else?
Velocity, right?
And I also wanted to say that this will help
us calculate the derivative of this function.
Exactly.
So the reason why I'm asking you about this limit
is because I want to find eventually some sort of
derivative.
So let's go and have a look how I do
that.
So.
I do it in the way in which I do
a derivative.
Right.
So in the first, in the first line, that's my
definition of the derivative.
No, you remember f you have f of x plus
h minus f of x of h.
And this is your derivative.
That's just that formula for principles.
First principle applied to the function we have at the
moment, which is the function h of t.
And that's the first derivative.
Now what that's going to think about if I want
to think about this.
So we said before that the derivative is a limit
and it doesn't always exist.
That's the formal definition.
When does this derivative exist.
Give them limits last week.
So you need to know this.
Yep.
Now come on.
The graph is continuous at that point.
So this is an interesting answer.
The answer was the derivative exists when the function is
continuous at that point.
Can anybody make a comment on this statement?
No.
How many people think that a continuous function means that
the function which is continuous at one point, means that
the function has a derivative at that point?
Guys.
What do you think?
The the function can exist.
, sorry.
The it can be continuous, but if it's got if
it's , , the tangent is vertical or there's a
corner or something, then it doesn't have a derivative because
the limit approaching either side gives a different tangent or
it's infinity.
Fantastic.
I don't know how many of you heard this.
Sorry.
Next time I'll bring the other mic.
So the fact that the function is continuous at one
point is a necessary condition for the derivatives to exist.
If the function is not continuous, the derivative of that
does not exist.
But it's not sufficient because, as your colleague said, I
can have functions which are continuous at one point, but
they don't have a derivative at that point.
And why could that be the case?
Well, the derivative is a limit.
So in order for that limit, whatever it represents to
exist, I need to be sure that coming to the
point zero from the right I obtain the same result.
Then I obtain coming from the point zero to the
left, which is where your colleague in the beginning of
the lecture was saying.
Right.
So.
Before the derivative exists, I need to make sure that
these two items limit from the right and limit from
the left at that point are the same.
Let's see whether I have an example.
Ah yes.
So mod x the function mod x which is the
function there on my graph.
Are we happy to say that that function is continuous
everywhere?
Why is that continuous at zero.
Who can tell me down here so I avoid another
going up and down?
Why is the function continuous at zero?
Do you want to see.
From the right.
Is equal to the limit from the left to the
value to the value?
Exactly.
The function is continuous because if you go and say
and do the limit of FFA of Fox to zero
from the left and to the right, these limits are
the same.
So the function is continuous at zero.
However, that function does not have a derivative at zero.
So you see how being continuous is a necessary condition.
If it is not continuous, forget it.
But it's not sufficient.
Something else must happen in order to have a derivative.
Okay, so let's see what else can we do.
So if I go back to my original question, which
we have answered half an hour ago, but in the
meantime we have said something which is really interesting.
And I apply the rules of the derivative.
I can calculate DDT of h of x, which we
had done.
But if I calculate the acceleration I do a second
degree derivative.
Okay.
Yeah.
So this is how in some sense we can connect
this quite abstract idea of taking derivatives each time two
things which are a little bit more applied.
So if there is anybody in here that's doing mathematics
and physics, then they will find this familiar, I imagine.
Okay.
Let's have a look.
I think I have one more question.
Oh, yeah.
There we are.
Okay.
As we did before.
Log in and then switch off the screen and then
we'll see what happens.
Oh gosh.
Okay.
Yeah.
And we'll take We'll take five minutes.
Okay.
Just have a bit of a think about it.
I.
Should have sat down.
That's all right.
Good for.
Me.
Are we assuming that the arrow was shot, , from
the ground?
Yeah.
And actually.
That's.
Subjective, right.
Yeah.
So we're assuming that it's shot from a height of
zero metres.
Okay, cool.
Thank you.
All.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm giving you two more minutes.
I've got loads of votes missing.
comparing to how many people are logged in.
Okay.
There are still about 80 people that haven't voted, so
about another 35 seconds.
Come on.
Gosh.
That's quiet.
Okay, let's have a look.
So this is the result of your vote.
And I am very pleased to say that.
I think that's the right answer.
So how do we get there?
Anybody that spotted that and wants to volunteer, how we
get there?
I can see no.
Hands up.
Nobody volunteering.
Okay, let's have a look.
So what do we need to do here?
If you look at the equation of the height which
is h of t, which is how the height varies
with bearing of time.
That equation is a second degree polynomial.
So it's some sort of a parabola okay.
And it is some sort of a parabola with the
concavity of both towards the, towards the bottom.
Because the first term because the square term is negative.
Okay.
So if I have a parabola and the term of
the x square is positive, the parabola has concavity towards
the top.
Otherwise it's concavity towards the bottom.
So I assume that I shoot an arrow From the
bow, from from the ground.
As your colleague has asked me, is exactly the right
assumption.
So what happens?
I shoot the arrows.
The arrows does something, and then it gets back to
the ground.
So at that time, at least two times.
So the start and the end, the height is zero
because the head has come up from the ground and
has done all its parabola and it's come back to
the ground.
So I need to find out where that is.
Zero.
And that height is zero for these two values.
So the first value seems obvious because he's zero at
the moment when I start, because I start from the
ground.
And that's the second value.
And to find the velocity I just find the first
derivative.
Okay.
Does this make sense?
Are you happy with the outcome of this question or
is there anything you would to ask?
No.
Okay.
Let's see what that's there is actually there is one
more slide to this.
Now.
I think we discussed this at great length in the
first week.
I'm a big fan of being able to draw graphs.
The parabola you see in that picture is not the
parabola described by this, by this equation of height, because
I tried to do that.
And it's really weird.
It's very narrow.
I have to magnify a lot, but it's a parabola
which looks pretty much the same.
Right?
It's concavity there at the bottom and as a maximum
somewhere there.
So if you see what happens to the R or
the arrow goes up and then changes direction right.
So you shoot an arrow it comes down this.
So at the top of the parabola the velocity is
zero okay.
And then it starts decreasing.
So we can think about this exercise also in that
way.
So we can think about this as a slope of
the tangent at the top.
The slope of the tangent is zero, because it's the
parallel to the max point of the parabola is parallel
to the x axis, so that the slope is zero,
and then it reverts back.
If you try to picture yourself how these functions work,
or if you go into Desmos and do it in
Desmos, that's also fine that it really is going to
be helpful to understand how these modelling problems look .
Okay.
And once you have learned how three or 4 or
5 standard curves work, one of which is the parabola,
then you will be able to recall this and be
able to work out what is that you need to
do.
But this is another way of thinking about it.
Okay.
Let's go back.
To.
Let's go back to not applications.
She said okay.
So this is just about.
Being differentiable.
So where does the derivative exist.
I am I logged in I'm going to switch this
office out right.
I noticed that there was an early voter.
So I'm going to give you four minutes.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Okay, one more minute.
I need more people to vote.
I only have 170 votes out of 298 people logged
in.
Have you voted?
Excellent.
Okay, this is now really interesting.
Now look at the votes.
So obviously only one of these two is correct.
Can somebody explain to me why they voted number two
and why the thing is correct?
Or just simply.
Can somebody tell me why they excluded zero.
Oh, sorry.
I did not see you up there.
Okay.
, so going back to, , first principles where,
defining the derivative for mod X, then there isn't a
limit at f of x equals zero for the mod
x part of the equation.
Equation?
No, but but there is no limit at zero
for the mod x part.
So you can't really define a derivative at zero.
Well let's have a look.
What happens.
Because I think the situation is a little bit more
complex than that.
So the first thing that would help and I would
I would recommend this is to plot the equation.
If you plot the equation, you see that the equation
is continuous at zero, right?
Let's have a look at the graph.
So when I have when I have things mod
and so on, I think it's helpful to think about
this as piecewise defined equations.
Right.
So this is the equation and this is the derivative.
Now if I show you the now the first thing
I want to say is that for what you see
on the board that derivative is continuous everywhere.
And we need to understand what happens at zero okay.
If I show you the plot of that equation.
This is the x mod x that's continuous at zero.
So in principle it could have a derivative.
Now, if I go and calculate the limits from the
left and the limit from the right of the derivative,
I found out that actually these are the same and
this is zero.
So this is defined everywhere.
So the right answer is the answer number three.
So when you think about this thing it is true.
Absolutely.
The mod X has does funny things around zero.
But that equation is not just mod x is x
times mod x.
And and doing yourself the graph of the equation helps
you understanding what's going on.
If that had had a massive discontinuity in zero, then
you could have said, okay, this is not what I'm
looking for.
But in fact, as you can see, it doesn't.
In fact, I think that will happen since zero changes
concavity, which is fine.
It's not a discontinuity, it's just how we call it.
, it's just a special point.
I think we have time for just one more.
Let's have a look.
This should be really, really easy.
We should be able doing this to go to go
away four minutes earlier than the hour.
Okay, so you have it there.
Can you log in?
I'm just going to switch to.
Oh, God.
Okay, that was quick.
We're not.
What can I say?
Is this the.
Hyperbolic.
Functions one or another one?
Sorry.
Say it again.
Is this the hyperbolic functions one?
Yeah.
You see two the x.
X is the x minus e negative x over two
or.
No no no we're not thinking about hyperbolic functions I'm
looking at that.
Well I'm going to say it in a minute, but
I'm looking at that as a composite function.
Right.
It's an f of g of x where the f
of x is the arcsine of the g of x
is the g of x.
Okay.
Yeah.
So.
Sorry for your loss.
Oh.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Somebody pointed out to my slides.
Can anybody else see my type in my slides?
Yep.
Yeah, exactly.
That should be d y d x, which I will
correct for next group.
That is coming after you.
Okay.
So I think that I can show you the results.
This was very very uncontroversial.
Because.
I think everybody has understood that we are dealing with
what.
Well what is that?
.
So what do I need to think about if I
want to take the derivative of that function?
Of course.
And you want to tell me.
.
And so by using the chain rule, you have the
derivative of arc sine of e to the x, which
is one over root, one minus e to the two
x multiplied by the derivative of e to the x,
which is just e to the x.
Exactly.
So this is the classic example of a time where
you need to remember the chain rule.
Okay.
This is a composition of function.
You have f of g of x and f of
x is the arcsine function.
And the g of x is the e to the
x function.
So if I wanted to just apply the .
The chain rule is the standard Chain rule application.
And so I have yeah.
You see I got it correct there.
So I have, I have d dx of f of
g of x is f dash of g f times
g dash.
This is pretty standard application of the chain rule okay.
So I think we're done for today.
Do you have any questions.
Anything you want to ask me.
Okay so we finished three minutes earlier then.
Guys, given that we're not going to be a lot
of people, can you come a bit closer so I
can see you?
Because otherwise I need binoculars to see you up there.
