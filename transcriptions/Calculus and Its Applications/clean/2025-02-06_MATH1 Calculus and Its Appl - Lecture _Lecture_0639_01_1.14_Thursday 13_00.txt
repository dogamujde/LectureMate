Hi everyone.
Sorry for the delay.
I have a class just before this one, so I.
It takes some time to run to this one.
, I, , right.
, it's just a sack.
We're running a minute late.
, wanted to show you something, but I can't find
it.
Okay.
Right.
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
Very good.
.
Okay.
Right.
Sorry for the delay.
, so today we will talk about.
We will continue discussing the applications of derivatives.
But before we do that, I would to remind
you that the mid-semester feedback is open.
It will be open until February 14th, I was told.
So please, please, please submit your feedback.
It's very valuable to us so that we know you
know what works, what doesn't work, what to how to,
you know, make this, , an optimal experience for,
for both of us, but, you know, mostly for you.
, so your feedback is very important.
Please submit your feedback.
I think it should be a learn.
I try to look for the link.
I didn't find it, but I think, , I wasn't
given Instructions, but I think you probably have.
And if anyone is unsure how to submit your feedback,
please let me know and I will ask the people
who do know.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Let's, , let's, , get on with this.
And, , we continue discussing the, , applications of derivatives
today as well.
.
Oh, God.
.
You're right.
Come on.
, please work.
Right.
Today we will talk about we will continue talking about
some of these, , in particular, we will explore maxima
and minima and do some interesting limits.
, yeah.
So let's start.
I'm giving you the question and I will now give
you the the options as well.
Let me log in to book club.
But for now obviously you can think about the question.
Okay.
This worked quickly.
No.
Not this.
Time.
Okay.
Okay.
So hopefully you see the options now, so vote for
the one that you think is the correct one.
Okay.
The voting is a little slow.
.
So.
Okay.
Okay.
, right.
So the voting is still going on, but I think
we are.
It's a little slow, so I'll give you one minute
and then we will discuss the question.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So let's see the results.
Oh, sorry.
.
The results.
Okay.
, interesting.
.
All right.
So the correct answer is was chosen by the majority,
but there were some, , there were some, , votes
for, , the the others.
So let's discuss the problem.
Right.
So what do we have here?
What kind of.
So this is clearly an optimisation problem right?
So we need to find the maximum.
We're giving the we're given the function and we want
to find the maximum value of that function.
But there are some constraints here right.
This is not just so x is allowed to take
particular values.
It's not allowed to take just any value.
And moreover since this is the revenue function and we're
interested in the maximal value of it.
Well, I mean it would be pretty bad if we
had negative maximal revenue, right?
That would be terrible.
So there are some constraints on this problem, right.
So since x is the number of sold units.
Can you please be quiet?
It's hard for me to speak, let alone scream.
, so.
Okay.
, so X is the number of units sold, and
therefore it has to be non-negative, right?
You can't sell negative units.
, also the the revenue has to be non-negative.
As I said, we don't want a negative revenue.
So we have two inequalities here.
We have two constraints here.
X is non-negative and this thing is non-negative right.
So solving this.
This part.
900 -60 times x to the power one over three
gives you that x has to be less than this
number 3375.
I'll just, .
Quickly.
, quickly, , show you.
I mean, it's I'm pretty sure you can do it,
but just to, you know.
So we need, , 900 -60.
Right.
, so that is what, am I, right?
, yeah, I am.
And then, , from here, you obtain that X has
to be less than or equal to this number.
Okay.
All right.
So, , so what did we find?
We found that we have an optimisation problem on a
closed bounded interval, which is good because we can use
one of my favourite theorems extreme value theorem.
So when you have a function that is continuous and
this is a continuous function on a closed bounded interval.
, so in this case it's the interval from 0
to 3 3375.
Then to find its absolute maximum you have to do
two things.
You have to find the critical points which I think
I assume that's what you did and how you got
the answer.
But also don't forget to see what happens at critical
points.
Sorry at the end points of the interval.
So at the point zero and 3375 right.
So this is what we do.
Luckily at the end points we have zero.
So therefore we the maximum will be found among
the critical points.
And when we set the derivative equal to zero, we
get x equals 1000.
As the only critical point right.
And then we evaluate the function at that point to
get 3000.
Let me just perhaps.
So the function is 900 -60 x over three.
Now.
So so we have to set that equal to.
Zero.
Sorry.
Take the derivative and set that equal to zero.
So what's the derivative there?
.
But, , there's something I don't about this.
.
Oh, that's not the right function.
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
This is the function.
Okay.
Cool.
Right.
So how to take the derivative 900 times two over
3X2 over three minus one star equals zero.
Right.
So 600.
Right.
So.
It goes.
Ten.
And that gives you a that gives you x
equals 1000.
Okay.
So let me zoom out.
So right there.
There you go.
And then this is the value that you plug into
the original function.
And you find three 30,000 is the maximum revenue.
Are there any questions.
right.
So if there are no questions let's move on to
another optimisation problem which will be slightly different.
Oh right.
So I also sketched the graph for you and forgot
about it.
But I didn't.
But I included it here.
So this is what the graph of this function revenue
function looks .
And you can convince yourself that indeed , at the
point 1000 you get the global maximum.
Okay.
Question number two Find the two positive numbers whose product
is 750, and for which the sum of one and
ten times the other is a minimum.
So I'll find it for you now.
And I will display it on up.
There.
Look at the results.
Good.
And that is indeed the correct answer.
But I would you to think about how this
optimisation problem is different from the previous one.
Right.
So when we approach the solution, I think probably you
denoted the numbers by x and 750 divided by x
and then you are.
So you wrote down this function which you have
to minimise.
However, you know this time we have no constraints on
X except that it's positive, but it's not , it's
not on a bounded interval.
So this is an an optimisation problem on an unbounded
interval, because x can take B any number between zero
and infinity.
, so , so we cannot use the extreme value
theorem because that one required a closed bounded interval.
So what do we do?
Well, , we can just investigate the behaviour of this
function, , using the derivative.
Right.
, so first we find the critical points, and it
turns out it only has one critical point on the
entire, , sorry, positive real line.
, so how do we know what kind of critical
point this is?
Is this a how do we know the nature of
this critical point?
How did you determine that?
How did you know this was the minimum?
Yes, please.
, that's a good.
Yeah, that's that's a good strategy as well.
But there is also something else you can do.
When you find a critical point.
How do you determine the nature of it?
Yes, please.
Second derivative.
Yeah.
Very good.
Indeed.
You can do exactly.
Those two will work.
So you can sketch and investigate the the function.
But you can also do the second derivative.
So computing the second derivative gives you the following number.
And since x is positive you know x can only
take positive values.
This will be positive.
That means that in particular it will be positive at
the point that you found.
So you have found yourself a local minimum, right.
And , so again the second derivative is positive everywhere
on the interval of interest.
And we conclude that the graph of the function is
concave up right.
So this is the absolute minimum.
So not only is it the local minimum because the
second derivative test gives you a local information.
But since you know you know that this second derivative
is positive everywhere.
So you know that the graph of the function is
concave up this.
Yeah.
And therefore the point that you found is absolute minimum,
not just the local minimum.
Alternatively, as you suggested, we can do something this.
, we can , find the first derivative and it
gives us the following expression.
And then we can look at the signs of it.
And that will tell us about the behaviour of the
function where it's increasing, where it's decreasing.
And , so , since it's positive on this interval
zero and then negative, , here we see that it
is.
So the function starts decreasing.
Decreasing reaches this point 50 times square root of three
and then starts increasing.
So it is a it is the absolute minimum.
Okay.
Very good.
Now the next question.
Yes.
Okay.
, so let's try to.
Solve this together.
Let's first look at the results.
Yeah, the results are good.
And that's indeed the correct answer.
So, , let's see how we can.
Solve this one together.
So, , I want you to pay attention to some
things.
So first of all, that, , what is, .
Okay, so we have the limit as x goes to
pi over two from the left of ten x.
To the power of cosine x.
So notice that, , when pi of.
So when x goes to pi over two from the
left.
This is positive because ten x is sine x over
cosine x.
And as long as these two stay in the first
quadrant this is non negative.
So this is a Positive.
Okay.
So is cosine x.
, but.
, as, , as you approach pi over pi over
two, this becomes, this goes to.
Zero.
So the whole thing approaches infinity.
So this is kind of limit of this kind.
Here because ten goes to infinity because the the
cosine goes to zero.
So you get a limit of this kind.
And this is the so-called one of the so-called indeterminate
forms.
, so in your book, , you have a recipe
of how to deal with indeterminate forms of this kind.
You consider the logarithm of this expression, right?
And that's where it's important that you are.
The expression is positive, , so that you can, .
, you can take a logarithm.
So consider.
, ln of ten x cos x.
Right.
So if you take the limit of this thing.
You can use properties of the logarithm to say that
it's the same as.
Right?
Okay.
, so now, , as I said.
So this goes to infinity.
So this will go to infinity.
This will go to zero.
So you have a limit of the kind zero times
infinity.
And to transform this into something that you know how
to deal with.
You can write it in this form.
Ellen Tan x divided by one divided by cosine x.
So now you have infinity over infinity which you know
how to deal with because you know lupita's rule.
So let me just write it out here.
Yeah.
Then this is the same.
So this is a one sided limit.
L'Hopital's rule works for a one sided limits as well.
Provided everything is, , nice enough and these functions are
indeed, , do indeed satisfy the assumption of the assumptions
of the rule.
So, .
So I'm taking the derivative.
.
Minus.
, minus.
Minus.
Right.
So these minuses cancel.
And what do I get?
I get one over ten x.
Unless I made a mistake.
I hope I didn't.
, what is that?
Cosine x sine x squared.
Yep.
That looks.
That looks right.
That looks okay.
, and this limit is zero, right?
But I'm not done because this is the limit.
The limit of the logarithm.
Right.
And to find the limit of the original expression, I
need to raise e then limit of.
Equals e to the power zero and equals one.
And I am using an important result here.
So.
, we calculated the limit.
It turned out to be zero.
And hence, by CRM 2.9, which is the composite function
theorem.
I have it here for, you know, here.
So this is the theorem in your book.
So by this theorem then I obtain that the limit
of the original expression is e to the power zero
and is equal to one.
Are there any questions about this.
So you may notice that I you know, I'm not
just doing the computations, but I'm also reminding you of
the theoretical results that I'm using because it's very important.
Right.
We are we are at the this is university City
level mathematics.
So we need to be able to justify all the
computations and all the statements and all the claims that
we make.
Therefore, always make sure that your computations are backed by
theoretical justifications.
For example, this composite function theorem.
Are there any questions?
I think we can do one more question.
Maybe.
Hopefully if it's short, I don't know.
Let me see.
Oh it's not short.
But , let's try this.
I'll give you I'll give you two minutes for this
question and I will also.
Okay.
So.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's see the results.
The results are.
It's true.
And that's indeed the correct answer.
And that's.
Yes.
So what you do is when you deal with a
limit this, you get rid of the.
So so you try to obtain some kind of, ,
, so some kind of constants in the numerator and
denominator denominator.
And , so if you perform these operations, you will
see that you will get a very quickly.
Let me do the docker.
So.
I started writing something for you already.
So once you multiply everything by this number, you get
something, you get this expression, and then you get three
to.
The two here or two.
And so what you obtain is that these guys go
to zero.
And you, you are left with minus one over two.
As t goes to infinity.
This is a negative power.
It goes to zero.
This goes to zero.
This goes to zero.
So you can apply the quotient rule because these limits
exist and you get minus one over two.
Okay, that's.
That was all for today.
