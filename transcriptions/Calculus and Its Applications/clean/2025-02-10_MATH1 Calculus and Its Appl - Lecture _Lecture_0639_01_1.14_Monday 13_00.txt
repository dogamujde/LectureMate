Okay.
Good afternoon and welcome to week five.
Can't believe it's already nearly halfway through the semester.
Are you all right?
Okay, so today we are going to talk about integrals.
, just for a very quick show of hands.
Oh my God.
Okay.
How many people.
How many of you know what is an integral.
Oh.
Okay.
So nobody else.
Okay.
So today we just give a quick introduction to what
are integrals and what are properties of integrals?
We as usual, we will have a couple of slides
with things which are important in the chapter that we
have read.
But please remember that this is not going to cover
the material of the chapter, right?
These are just 3 or 4 points which I think
that are important to remember.
And I know the students sometimes, sometimes don't think about
when they do exercises with integrals.
So let's have a look.
And then we will do our quizzes as usual.
So.
The first thing that was so the integrals came about
because in some sense mathematicians want wanted to calculate the
area between a curve and the x axis limited by
two points.
Right.
So this was an approximation idea that there were no
kind of ways of thinking about this before.
And some mathematicians talk.
Okay, what about if I use an approximation method?
You will have seen in your book that we can
approximate some area from the bottom and from the top,
so overshooting and undershooting and then the limit is the
integral.
In the next lecture on Thursday we will see one
of these approximation methods that were used, which is the
Riemann sums, which is exactly what it does.
But this is how integrals came about.
, integrals are.
A linear operator just as much as the derivative is.
What does it mean that they are linear operator work
that these two properties hold so that the sum of
integral.
So the integral of a sum is the sum of
the integrals.
And if I have a constant time, the integral of
a constant time function.
The integral of these functions is the constant time the
integral of the function.
So this is what it means to be a linear
operator, right?
So in mathematics we think about this saying that it
behave nicely.
Right.
So it doesn't do anything strange that we would not
want it to do.
So when we talk about integral we distinguish between definite
integral and indefinite integral.
So definite integral is the integral of a function between
two given points.
I've called them a and b here.
So an indefinite integral is an integral of a function
but not really defined in in which point.
The thing that sometimes students don't think about is that
when I calculate an indefinite integral, the outcome of the
calculation of the actual integral of the function is not
complete if I don't add the constant of integration.
Why?
I'm asking this question just in case somebody wanted to
answer.
Yes.
Essentially, you're.
Essentially, you're solving for a certain function, but there's whole
family functions that would, , make this relationship we're given.
True.
And so the unspecified constant is a way of, ,
notating this entire family of functions, whereas missing off one
only gives a single function when there's more.
So what is the idea?
Think about the definite integral for a minute.
The definite integral.
You solve the integral, and then you actually go and
calculate the area under the curve between the two points
which are given, which are RMB.
If you calculate the indefinite integral that still is trying
to give you the area between two points, but the
points are not specified.
So as your colleague was saying, there is whole family
of functions that could give you the area under the
curve given two points where the curve is defined.
And this is why we put a concept of integration
T to indicate that that is a family of functions.
Okay.
What is the outcome of a definite integral?
What kind of mathematical object is the outcome of a
definite integral?
No takers.
What do I get at the end of whatever machinery
I use to calculate the definite integral?
Yep, exactly a number a value.
Okay, so this out comes from the definite and the
indefinite integrals.
They are different not only because they mean different things,
but they are really different mathematical objects, right?
The first one is a noun, but the second one
is a family of functions.
I think it's always kind of useful to have in
mind.
What are the things you're playing with when you do
mathematical operations?
What are the things you get on the other side?
Okay, so let me sort yourself out.
.
Can you see?
Oh, okay.
So if you want to log in into our session
today.
We can start, , we can start with our with
our questions, as usual.
Please don't start responding.
Just log in to the session and then I'll obscure
the, .
The screen is just.
It's just better.
I think, if you do it this way.
Okay.
Oh, man.
Can you please stop voting for a minute?
Okay.
Man.
It's just.
Okay.
I'm going to call it.
Well, we leave this first one this, and then
we'll cover up the replies for the future ones.
I'll give you another three minutes just to have a
look at what is the answer.
For.
All of.
Bye bye.
Okay, so let's have a look.
Why do we think?
Actually, let me grab the other mic.
Why do we think that that is true.
That.
Somebody could have voted for true.
Tell me what they think is true.
Yeah.
Because it's just the sum of all of the different.
, it's a sum of in pieces, and the strings
been chopped into pieces.
So the whole sum is the whole string.
Yeah.
So the mike wasn't great, but this is exactly the
right answer.
So I've chopped my string in n pieces.
So obviously the sum of these pieces will be the
length of the string.
So if I want to formalise this a little bit
by trying to use some of the appropriate mathematical language,
I would, I would say it it this way.
So that is my very poor representation of a piece
of string, I'm afraid, on the left hand side.
But on the right hand side, what do I say?
Well, this is an interval that goes from x0 to
x n and that length which is x n minus
x0.
Because we know how to calculate the length of segment
is exactly the sum of all the n pieces of
string I've chopped my string in.
So if you look, if you think for a moment
about what that sum looks , if you had to
unpack all this delta x one, delta x two and
so on, you will find that at the end you
are left with the way that we know.
We calculate the length of a string which is x
n by minus x zero okay.
So this is a first if you thinking
about calculating lengths and areas by thinking about chopping things
into intervals and then seeing how we how we can
do the sum.
Of course, in the case of a string.
I don't need to do any approximation.
I know how to calculate length of pieces of string,
if you .
Let's see.
Let's see another one.
Oops.
Ah, okay.
So wait, this is my question.
So take a minute to think about this.
And I will cover up.
The project.
Okay.
So.
The.
Okay.
So.
Let's.
Move on.
All.
Right.
Yes.
Okay.
So not a lot of people have voted, so come
on.
Three more minutes.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank.
You.
Thank.
You.
I think.
I mean.
Okay, let's have a think about our options here.
Yeah.
Okay.
So why?
, so somebody that voted for the first option.
So the first option, say it doesn't really matter how
many sectors are the circle into somebody that said that
that question is right.
Can they tell me why they thought it was right?
That's a good question.
There is a lot more people in this room than
the 8% who voted that.
That is right, because there is a lot of people
that voted for all the possibilities to be correct.
So why is that right?
There are.
No takers.
Okay.
, it's kind of the same thing as before.
Yeah.
The equation that's given just does give the area off.
Yeah.
So if you add all of the sectors together, you
get the area of the circle.
It's not really an approximation thing where you have
to say that, , it's the limit of an infinity,
but also b and C mean the same thing.
Okay, so what did we say here?
Obviously the first question is correct because it's exactly the
same exercise that we did before.
But this time I'm looking at cutting into bits an
angle rather than a piece of string.
So it doesn't really matter how many pieces I cut
this angle into the An will be.
Will be the same.
So basically that question is telling me that the the
measure of that angle doesn't change.
If I cut it in 10 in 10 angles or
20 angles or 30 angles, it's the same, exactly the
same thing that we said before.
What about the second one?
What do we think about the second one?
Why is the second one correct?
Anybody wants to.
Not.
Sure what to say.
So what do we need?
What do we think?
That's correct.
Come on.
Yep.
Excellent.
, if we know that, , that that's true for
all n, then it's the limit will also still be
equal.
Yep.
Exactly.
So if I think in terms of, , I don't
know how to say it of iteration of the technique
I had before.
I have ten, , ten sectors, 26 or 30 sectors.
Whatever I go, I can go as far as I
want.
That will be the limit.
And what is three?
What is the third bit?
The third answer.
Well, you have it.
You have it there, right?
Who is that thumb?
I can write it as the integral between 0 and
2 pi of the area as, , in the delta.
So the third one is also correct.
So the correct answer was that these are all different
ways of thinking about how to use this type of
approximation, apart from the fact that, as your colleague said
before, in this case we are not really approximating in
this case, we have a formula to calculate these measures
that we're looking for, but I can express them in.
In sum of sectors, I can express them as a
limit.
I can express them as an integral.
This is all the same measure.
It is measuring always the same object and so all
the outcomes are the same.
It would be sad if I was measuring the same
object in different ways, and the outcomes were not the
same.
Okay, let's have a look at this one.
Is.
That all things.
That.
Are.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Is.
There anything?
Thank you.
Thanks for.
The call.
Okay, so I'm satisfied with the number of you who
have voted.
Let's see the answer.
So what do we think about this?
So you got it right.
Why did you think that this is sometimes.
Right.
That's right.
I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.
That's right.
Come on.
, so when you when you integrate a differentiable function,
it becomes the function before it got differentiated or integrated.
, so it would be f of t.
And I thought if it's saying it's equal to f
of x.
And that would only be true if the x was
the same as the T, or if both of them
were zero or f or zero.
Yeah.
, which would be sometimes, , yeah.
That's right.
Exactly.
So what's happening here?
This is definitely not always true.
But I can show you at least one case in
which it is true.
So it's not always wrong either.
What is that happens here?
So I'm trying to integrate this function missing in zero
and x.
So what mathematical objects do I expect to have from
an integration between zero and x.
So you've calculated this integral.
What do you get.
Well you can see that right as a function.
So even if we say that when I calculate the
integral, the definite integral that the outcome is usually a
number, it was a number in the example I showed
you before.
But I could replace one of the extremes of integration
with the variable, and in that case I would obtain
a function.
In this particular case, I just want to understand when
this function is equal of f of x.
And of course this is only true if f of
zero is equal to zero.
So be careful.
This is a little bit of a logic point
here sometimes for the right question.
Because this is not always true, because f of zero
could be any other number, in which case it wouldn't
be f of x and is true sometimes.
So it's not never true.
Be careful when you do quizzes and think about, well,
actually the things that you are that you are asked
to do mean so never would mean never, so that
you cannot produce a case for which this is true.
Once I've shown you a case for which this is
true, okay, let's do one more.
It's so hard.
So.
That's.
The reason.
Why I.
Oh.
My God.
Yeah.
I.
Forgot.
Okay, this is a nice question.
Okay.
Requires two minutes of thinking.
.
Sometimes.
Oh, my.
God!
Oh!
God!
Oh, God!
Oh my God!
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So let's have a look.
How many people have voted?
Okay, one more minute.
Not a lot of people have voted yet.
So when you need to do multiple choice questions of
this type.
Right.
So you have either this happens or that happens.
Try to think carefully about what the question is asking
because this is really important as we will see in
the answer of these questions.
Okay.
Okay, let's do it.
So what do we think about these results?
So who agrees with the most voted item which is
to.
You agree?
Why?
So first the first one.
, so the first one, by the definition of an
integral, it has to be the area that is enclosed
by the graph of f and the both and the
two bounded lines.
X equals a and x equals b.
And that also means that number two needs to be
correct because as it is an area it has to
be a number.
Yeah.
So I want to do a thought experiment.
Now we said that the integral between A and b
of f of x dx is the area bounded by
that two points.
What if the area is under the x axis?
Think about this for a moment.
What happens if I have a function that looks
this?
And I'm calculating the area between A and B.
What is the sine of that integral?
Negative.
Can we have an area which is negative.
No.
So what is the problem with the first question?
With the first answer.
That that is true.
That the integral is the area bounded by the graph
of x and the x axis between a and b
only if the function is all above the x axis.
Be careful because this catches out all students.
Every time.
When you are asked about an area, you are asked
about the measure of something that cannot be negative, right?
The area cannot be negative the measure of a
piece of string cannot be negative.
In the worst cases it's zero.
So for example, if I look at my function here
up on the board and I did the calculations, the
area I think would come up to zero, right.
Because this at the bottom and at the top, I
think if I remember correctly, my example, they are the
same.
Is it possible that the area under the curve, this
curve is zero.
But our eyes tell you that.
Tell us that this is not possible.
So what is the issue here?
That when I ask about the area, I ask about
a measure of something that has to be positive.
So to say that the integral is the area is
not correct is the mod of the integral.
Right.
So it's the absolute value.
Why do I eat?
So let's have a look at Finnish to have a
look at this example.
Right.
If I wanted to calculate the integral between that two
points of my function, the way in which I should
do is this way.
The area is the mod of that integral.
Okay.
Because this tells me that the area is these two
green parts highlighted.
So when you are required to say whether something is
something in this case, is this integral the area
of something?
Try to think about what you're being asked.
The area by definition cannot be negative.
So obviously the first question was not correct.
Right.
And the correct version of the first of the first
point there would have been.
Is it true that the the mode of the integral.
Between a and b of f of x dx is
equal to the area.
Okay.
So be careful with that.
This catches up.
Also, I don't really know why students find this quite
difficult, but they do.
So think about what you have been asked to find.
Okay.
And this is the calculation for that particular for that
particular function.
The second one of course is correct.
Right.
So the second one is correct.
And that is indeed the definition of integral okay.
So we are happy I said that the integral is
is its definition.
So that's fine.
What about the third one.
Well the third one cannot be first of all because
we have seen that the first one is not correct.
But also because the antiderivative is a function.
Yep.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Shouldn't be inside the interval.
No.
You want to put the mod on the value that
you find, right?
Six minus four.
That's two over one six plus modulus minus four.
Yes.
Depends on the shape of the function.
But you want the mod or the pieces.
So this is a good question.
So the situation is a little bit more complicated.
It's a really good question.
Thank you for that.
So if my function was to find this area okay.
Then I have the mod of that function.
But in the case I want to find this area
as I had in the slide.
Right.
So say that I wanted to find the integral between
C and b.
I would have to split the integral.
The first integral is positive.
The second integral is negative and I take the mod
of that.
Okay.
Thank you.
That was really a good question.
So what were we.
So the fourth my fourth option.
Is always not correct.
So the fourth option we remember is that the function
is continuous.
Then the integral doesn't always exist.
And again this is not correct.
I'm told the function is continuous.
Obviously I'm really only interested in the integral of if
I have a definite integral only interest in the interval
in which I'm.
I'm calculating the integral.
If I want to calculate the indefinite integral, then I
need it to be continuous everywhere, because otherwise there would
be possible where it doesn't exist.
But I am told that this is continuous in A
and B, and therefore only the second option is correct.
Okay.
So let's see one more question.
Thank you very.
Much.
Oh that's great.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well.
That's.
Okay.
So this is quite quick.
And the issue here is naming issue.
Right.
So it's our call things.
I have here the same function under the integral.
And as an outcome of the integral.
And this is of course not what I want to
have.
Right.
Because as the way in which this, this equation is
written at the moment is telling me that the derivative
of the integral between f of x a and b
of f of x dx is f of x, which
is obviously not true.
So the way in which I want to write this
equality is by using another symbol.
Okay.
In this case I've used capital F for the other
function.
The idea here is that you need to check and
be careful with the notation, right in that in that
formula, the notation was wrong in the sense that the
notation, if you write it correctly, would give you a
false result.
And we call f capital f of x the integral
between a or x of f of t and then
f of x is f of x.
Okay.
So be careful how you write mathematics.
Writing mathematics is not easy sometimes, but it's often precise.
So.
Question six and as always I'm going to put the
slides online I apologise I put the slides for week
one online and I didn't realise that I couldn't see
them.
Why wasn't.
It true?
Because let me just switch this off.
So that the main reason is that I used the
same symbol for the integral between a and b of
a for x and the outcome, and so I need
to use a different symbol for the antiderivative.
And this explanation.
Yeah there is an explanation in the slides.
But I want to go I've got I think two
more questions.
So I want to finish before we finish.
But there is a calculation in the slide.
Why does he.
Okay, so that's excellent.
Somebody that tells me why that is false.
What do we think?
Sorry.
Yep.
Oh.
, f of x and g of x could be
different by some constant.
Exactly.
So this is exactly the point, right?
F of x and g of x could be different
functions.
And that differ by a constant.
One could be three x plus three and the other
one could be three x.
These are not the same function but the derivatives are
the same.
Okay.
So be careful again.
Just think about what you're looking for.
Okay.
So shall we do the last one.
Oh.
How do you think?
The white.
House.
Okay, so we have three minutes left.
So let's see.
What happened?
Why is this true?
So think about the process of integration.
And what is the difference with the process of calculating
the derivative.
Why do we think that that's true.
Which it is.
Oh thank you.
Right.
, so.
I did integration of f of x is equal
to a big f of x plus let's say c
a constant one.
And then integration of g of x is equal to
a big g of x plus constant two.
And then f of x plus constant one has to
be equal to g of x plus constant two.
Exactly.
So this is the the nice way of doing it.
So you calculate the integral, the g of x and
f of x by having some different concepts.
If the integrals of this function need to be the
same, then the constant need to be the same, right?
The quick way of of saying it is that these
functions have the same antiderivative, and therefore they need to
be the same.
And this should be in your book.
So just to kind of plug up this idea that
for two functions, if they have the same derivative, there
is no saying whether they are the same function or
not.
But if they have the same integral then they are
the same function.
And we can show this quite quickly.
Okay.
So I shall see you Thursday.
And don't forget about the workshops tomorrow.
Thank you.
