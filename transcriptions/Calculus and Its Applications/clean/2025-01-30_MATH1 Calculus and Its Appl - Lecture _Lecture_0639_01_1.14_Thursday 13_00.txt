Hello.
Good afternoon.
So today we will carry on talking about derivatives.
What we will do, we will see some applications of
laws of derivatives and derivatives of special functions or logarithm
and all this.
But we will also talk about implicit implicit differentiation.
Who can tell me what this is.
What is implicit differentiation and when do we use it.
Oh gosh.
You should come and sit at the front.
Okay.
That is all right.
Tell us.
I know.
Implicit differentiation is, I think, implicit.
No.
It's not.
What?
Wait.
Oh.
.
Implicit differentiation is when, , we do differentiation involving a,
, implicit function.
For example, for example, if you have, , say, ,
the equation of a circle x squared plus y
squared equals some constant, , well you could , do
it normally.
, you could , apply the differentiation to both x
and y.
, except with.
While differentiating the y, you multiply it by dy over
dx.
Excellent.
So that's exactly it.
And that's exactly the example I have in the slides
now.
So the idea of implicit differentiation is something that allows
us to differentiate functions where I cannot separate the variables.
So the example of the circle is really an interesting
example because there's a quite simple process.
And it can show you, as we will see in
a minute, how by carrying out the implicit differentiation and
kind of changing the shape of the equation and carrying
out normal differentiation, we get to the same result.
So what are we going to do today.
So the first thing we'll think about we'll think a
little bit more about rules around the products of functions.
How do I differentiate the product of function of the
quotient?
I don't have it up there, but I'm sure it's
in the book or the composition of functions.
I think we saw already one exercise last week, nor
last week on Monday about composition of functions.
So we'll just go and do a little bit of
those as well.
But as I was saying, I want to talk a
moment about implicit differentiation.
And I want to go through the example that just
by chance, I assure you this is a coincidence that
your colleague mentioned.
So suppose I have a circle.
Suppose I want to calculate the slope of the tangent
to that circle at some point.
So the first thing I need to think about is
that if I want to do this with normal procedures,
the things we have seen up to Monday, that
is not a function.
So I need to do something to it, right?
It's not a function, you remember?
Because if I apply the vertical test, the vertical test
fails a vertical line that cuts the circle cuts the
circle in two points, which tells me immediately that is
not a function.
However, I can consider some sections of this shape.
So for example, I can consider the upper the upper
circle by writing this function in the shape y equals
something.
And that is a perfectly good function.
Okay.
So if you apply the vertical test to this section
of the circle we are all happy.
So suppose I want to calculate the tangent line to
one to a point in that section.
I can just write the equation.
Is explicit form and this will become y.
If I want to just consider the top semicircle, this
will become y equal one minus x squared.
And then I can calculate the derivative in a standard
way as I calculate the derivative of questions.
Right.
So that's that's absolutely fine.
In fact that derivative is I can consider it
a composition of functions, right where I have the A
quotient, and at the bottom I have a square root.
So I need to think about the derivative of the
square root.
But inside the square root I have another function.
So I need to apply the formula for the composition
of function.
And if you do all the calculations which I don't
want to do for this one, you get the point.
If you don't believe me, do the calculations and then
tell me.
So this is the standard way that we know how
to do.
What we were saying.
Before is okay, I don't want to do that.
I want to carry on with this idea of differentiating
implicitly.
And so basically what we do, we consider the differentiation
of x and y in a way together.
So if I have the equation of a circle my
circle was I think x squared plus y squared equal
to one.
I apply the rule of the of implicit differentiation.
session.
And this is the process.
This is around page 310 in your book.
I think there is a chapter dedicated to implicit differentiation.
And when I go to calculate the debt expression at
the point where I wanted to calculate the the slope
of the tangent.
Thankfully I obtained the same result.
Now obviously in a case this, it is not
convenient to use implicit differentiation because it's much easier to
rearrange the function and consider just the part of the
function where I want it to go and calculate the
derivative.
But there are a lot of cases in which this
is not possible.
So where the algebraic expression is quite complex and it
is not possible to go and rearrange it in a
way.
Y equal.
And these are the cases where implicit differentiation comes in.
So this is the topic for today.
Let's see.
Oh I don't know what's going on.
Let's see some exercises.
So I'll put this up and I'll bring it up
here.
.
Yep.
Excellent.
So if you log in, I think it worked really
quite well on Monday.
, have a look and then I'll switch.
I'll switch the book club off, and I'll give you
a little bit of time to think about.
About it.
Is everybody logged in?
Yeah, I can see it.
389 people.
Oh, okay.
People are still logging in.
Okay.
Oh, wait until I start replying.
Come on.
There you are.
Okay, I'll give you three minutes, because this should be
really pretty straightforward.
And then we'll have we'll have a look at it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Another question.
Thank.
You.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I need a few more boats.
Not even a fourth of the people logged in and
put it.
Down.
Okay, this should be pretty straightforward, so I'm quite happy
to to have to have a look.
So this is the.
The consensus.
And I think I'm I am happy to go with
that.
Somebody can explain to me why that's true.
So maybe I should qualify somebody in the bottom section
of the lecture theatre.
Can you explain to me why this is true?
Okay.
So what do we think?
Do you want to say.
So.
I mean, the reason for this is straightforward.
That is the definition of the derivative of that function
at that point.
Right.
If you remember we calculate the derivatives with limits.
And the limit is on the size of the increment
of the x of the x right.
So.
This is my definition of derivative.
I've just changed the point.
The unknown x with the with the value three.
And I've calculated the limit.
So that is exactly the definition of the derivative.
Okay.
Let's go and have a look at next one.
Okay.
You have the text on the slide.
Yeah.
You need to understand that once you understand something.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, I'll give you two more minutes.
Still, not a lot of people have bought it.
So now we see what?
What this is.
Don't miss it.
What do you want to do?
Okay, let's have a look.
So I think that we are correct.
So that's excellent.
This exercise is interesting in some way because this is
a typical example of a function that it is not
possible to, to take in the form of y equal
right.
So for the circle we say that with a simple
operation we could separate the two arms of the circle.
If you write.
In fact we could have done different things.
I could have also just considered one quarter of the
circle.
That would have also been possible.
But with this function, this is not possible.
I cannot bring this in the form of y equal
and so on into to use implicit differentiation.
The result is indeed the first, and this is the
way that we find it.
So if you look at this, at this calculation, so
the the number, the question, the reply number three was
only to bring your attention.
And when we look at this calculation, we need to
be careful with taking accounts, all the signs and everything.
Okay.
The number three is just the correct solution with the
wrong sign.
So the process in which we do this is the
usual process.
It's the same process that we have seen for the
equation of the circle.
This was also quite yeah.
And there is a typo.
It's also quite straightforward.
Right.
So we we carry on the process and we obtain
this.
The only thing which is I mean, if I remember
myself as a student when I was doing this stuff,
the only thing that I found difficult about implicit differentiation
is that the calculations were a bit fiddly.
That's what I remember.
So the idea is not quite very difficult, but to
be able to calculate, to carry on the calculations properly
is a bit fiddly.
So my advice would be to do a lot of
exercises.
Okay, do a lot of the stock quizzes and do
a lot of the exercises from the book, because that
will give you some dexterity with doing these kind of
calculations.
Now, of course, I have the d dx and I
could have just oh, sorry.
No this were not the same.
Sorry they were switched.
Sorry I was misreading.
I couldn't quite read the third function.
This plain book club is not quite clear.
Okay, now the only thing I wanted to say is
that this d dx, which I found is itself a
function, right?
I could in principle calculate the derivative that would be
the second derivative of the of the function which I
originally had, and I would do this applying implicit differentiation
again.
My thinking is that as we go out up with
the degrees of differentiation, this becomes more and more difficult
because the algebraic expression becomes more and more difficult.
but I think it's really important to to keep in
mind that although we have obtained this dy dx by
applying a procedure, we are going in and with uncertain
algebraic movements, if you , that has given you that
that is an object in itself.
And this is something that is really important to remember.
Okay.
Let's see next exercise.
Okay.
So I am going to give you 5 or 6
minutes to do this because this is quite.
So this is a bit fiddly okay.
So I was trying to.
1900.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is .
A lot of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I can see more.
There are people still writing, so I'll give you another
minute or so.
Yeah.
Yes.
Okay.
Shall we take a look?
So that is indeed.
See the correct result.
Now this exercise is interesting because it's one of these
exercises that we really cannot do in the form in
which we are given it.
So somebody who voted see tells me what are what
is the first thing that they did.
it?
.
Well, the problem is.
The log that's in the power.
So if you take the natural log of both sides,
then using log laws, you can, , bring the sort
of power down as a coefficient at the front, and
then it's much easier to implicitly differentiate.
Exactly.
So I have a logarithm of the exponents and the
exponents that I have no idea what to do with
this.
really, I have no idea what to do with
this, and I need to remember what the rules of
the logarithms of what movements do I know that allow
me to make this a bit more accessible?
And as your colleague said, exactly.
That's what we need to do.
We take logs.
Okay.
And then now we have taken logs, and now this
looks already a lot more possible.
Yeah.
Now, just as an aside, we do all these operations,
algebraic operations, these functions.
In principle, we should check that it is possible to
do this operation and where it is possible to do
these operations.
Okay.
So we have constraints on the X and so on.
For now we just don't do this.
We concentrate on the technique of solving this exercise.
But remember that these are all functions which are domain
and have range.
And so that would be in principle interesting to know.
So now we have taken logs are much.
I am a much happier person.
So what is the next thing that I need to
think about.
Okay.
So what is the next?
The next action.
Yeah.
Do you want to say here.
Do you want to say it in the market?
Those people can't hear here.
You.
Know.
Okay, let's have a look.
So the next thing I need to do is to
think about what are the laws of the logarithms.
Now, I know that there are lots of laws that
regulate how logarithms multiply, divide and add and so on
and so forth.
We've seen some of them, I think, on Monday.
So now I have that expression and I apply the
laws of the logarithms.
And if I apply the laws of the logarithms I
get that.
And then I differentiate as you see.
So the the thing that was interesting in this exercise
is this idea that once we have a function which
we don't immediately think, oh yes, I can apply this
rule or I can do that, we need to think
about what do I know that I can do in
order to make this function, so that I can calculate,
in this case the implicit differentiation.
And then from there I can just get on with
it.
Then I multiplied by y and I find that okay.
Now, this is not going to be always obvious.
And as I said before regarding implicit differentiation, these exercises
are not conceptually difficult if you .
They are a bit fiddly, so I would really advise
to do quite a bit of them so you can
learn in situations when I have a logarithm of
the exponent.
What do I do?
I take logs.
Okay.
So if you do a lot of them then you
will see that you will apply techniques.
You will acquire techniques that will allow you to solve
these exercises quite quickly.
And I think it is important.
So if you remember Chris in his first lecture when
he was talking about these kind of procedures, yes, I
can stick this in.
Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Alpha can do it for me.
It doesn't take a minute, but it's important to be
able to to carry out this procedure because it is
important to be able to check them and see whether
the results I obtain is a result, which is plausible.
This is important for mathematics and is important for a
lot of other disciplines, for example statistics.
Okay.
Next one.
What do we do?
I.
Think.
You're both in too quickly for me.
Give me a break.
Thank you.
Thank you.
.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So there we are.
So I am delighted about the result of this vote
because we talked about this on Monday.
Who can give me an example of a function that
is continuous, but it has no derivative or whose derivative
is not continuous.
I'm not going to ask you to shout.
It's not going to work.
What is.
It?
Modulus of x.
Yeah.
We saw this last.
We saw this on Monday.
Right.
Do you remember on Monday we were talking about the
function mod X.
And we were discussing the fact that being continuous is
a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition even to
have a derivative at all.
So let alone having a continuous derivative, in fact, is
exactly the example that I have here.
Can anybody think of any other example?
Square root of x y.
The derivative will be vulnerable to.
Square root of x.
And x can take value zero.
Exactly.
So if you do the derivative of square root of
x, what happens to the function that you obtain as
a derivative is not a continuous.
It's not a function which is continuous everywhere.
No.
But my go to example is always this.
Well the x okay.
So it's really interesting because when you were solving this
example, I saw a lot of people making gestures
with their hands and mapping functions.
When you do this, when you deal with functions, making
pictures is really, really important.
But this is important and I think that you will
have seen also, I imagine you have seen also in
PES the difference between a necessary and sufficient condition for
a theorem.
Have you?
You must have done when you have a theorem and
something must happen.
But it doesn't guarantee, right?
here, a function must be continuous to have a
derivative, but is not sufficient.
Okay, let's see what else happens today.
Oh.
Yeah.
How can you be.
Quiet.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you so.
Much for joining us today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
So.
There.
Are people.
Who?
Are.
Excited.
Thanks.
For coming.
Thank you for joining.
Us today.
Thank.
Make?
Sure.
You.
I.
Think it's.
Okay.
Should we have a look?
Okay.
So, .
That's correct.
So the solution is, , number two.
What is interesting about this, , this example.
So what is g dash of zero?
What mathematical object is?
I don't want to know anything else.
What's the rate of change of the function g at
x equals zero?
Yes, but what mathematical object is Say it's number.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So this is interesting because sometimes some students may be
thrown out by the fact that they cannot actually calculate
g of zero because we don't know who g of
x is.
But the only thing you need to know about this
is that there is a number, right.
So whatever number we are not interested.
So if I then get into the idea that g
g dash of zero and zero zero numbers.
So I treat them numbers, then this exercise becomes
quite easy because all what I need to do, I
need to.
I only have a product to differentiate there.
I have x g of sine of x.
So I have a product and a composition function, which
can be the only one that is a little bit
difficult, but I just go in with the rules of
differentiation.
I can differentiate that.
And so I find that that's the derivative of that.
If you do the product and then you do the
composition of function, because sine of g of x is
a composition of function.
And then you find that and then you calculate that
at zero.
Of course when you calculate that at zero, anything that
trigonometric function that goes zero and zero disappears.
And you and you find the second solution.
So when you have exercises of this sort, don't get
confused by the fact that you don't know what the
function g is.
So you cannot calculate g of g in this case
g dash of zero.
Exactly.
It doesn't really matter.
It's a number and all.
What matters in solving exercises this is that that
is a number and a treated a number.
And that's how I write it is minus sine of
g of zero, whatever number that may be.
Okay.
Let's do the oh gosh okay.
Let's do the last one.
Yes.
All right.
Thank.
You.
Very.
Much.
Thank.
You.
For.
Okay.
This is amazing.
This is amazing.
Honestly.
Okay.
What is this?
What have you done?
Somebody.
Yep.
Chain rule.
Exactly.
This is all what there is.
You have that function that, , where you need to,
.
Yeah.
What?
You need to apply the the chain rule because you
have the g of x.
If I have g of f of x, g of
x in this case would be , the square root
of x and f of x would be x.
So if I think about applying the chain rule, then
this is what I would find.
Pretty straightforward.
So in conclusion for this lecture today.
Yes.
On Monday we have seen some ideas which are a
little bit more conceptual.
Regarding the derivative.
So things when the derivative exists.
And so on and so forth.
We have talked about limits and how to calculate it.
So today we have done a little bit more about
how to solve these exercises.
These are pretty straightforward exercises once you know what you
are looking for.
And there are a few things that you need to
keep in mind.
You need to keep in mind the rules of the
logarithms you need to keep in mind.
The rules of differentiation.
Both differentiation of known functions logarithms.
Square roots, and so on.
But also the rules of composition and product of functions.
And then you will have no problem in solving these
exercises.
Okay.
Do you have any questions?
Okay.
I'll see you.
I'll see you week five, actually.
Now, when you take this.
So.
I want to show.
You.
And now.
