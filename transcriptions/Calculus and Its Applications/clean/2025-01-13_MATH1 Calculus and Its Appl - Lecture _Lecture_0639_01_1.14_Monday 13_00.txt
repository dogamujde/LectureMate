Okay.
Good afternoon everyone.
Welcome to calculus and its applications.
Let's make a start.
There's a lot of you.
As you can see, it's a big group.
We do need your quiet, folks.
Please take your seats.
Folks.
Quieten down.
Please, everyone.
Folks.
Quiet and down, please.
Please.
There's 400 of you and one of me, right?
We need your cooperation for this to work.
That includes coming in on time, please.
And using all the seats, so I appreciate.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
All right.
Welcome to calculus applications.
My name is Chris Sanguine.
I'm the course organiser.
Paglia is one of the other course team.
There will be other members of the course team we
will introduce in due course.
, but I'm here today to just give you a
little bit.
Of course, admin and background to the course.
, before we before we start the course proper.
It's a big group, folks.
So thank you for your cooperation.
Welcome to cap.
I'm going to talk about four things.
I'm going to talk about the course introduction.
I'm going to talk about assessment.
I'm going to say a few a few words about
artificial intelligence and its role in assessment.
And then we're going to have a little interesting puzzle
to get us back on track so that we can
start the course.
So as this is semester two course, I am sure
by now you're all familiar with learn.
Here is the learn page for calculus and its applications.
And most of the course information is on the learn
page for this course.
So all the assessment and feedback information is on here.
It's 60% written exam 40% coursework.
All the dates are in this table.
Okay.
So that's where to find all your coursework and deadlines.
I am being recorded, but I'll say it anyway.
I don't think I'm not all that big a fan
of learning, to be honest.
, I think anyway, so we've put most of the
course materials over here on the stack service, right?
So that includes, , the course textbook.
, let me just scroll down a little bit.
The course textbook.
The assignments which will appear in due course each week.
We have a little quiz that takes you through the
intended reading and asks you questions about the reading, right.
There will then be an assessed quiz.
There will be workshop tasks, there will be solutions, and
so on and so on.
So we have two lectures a week and we have
one 1.5 hour workshop.
So it's 80 minutes in a 1.5 hour slot basically.
, there's no easy way to say this, so I'll
just sort of say it.
Success in life is mostly down to consistency, right?
By which I mean, please show up every week to
as many sessions as you can and do the work.
Right.
It's that's that's just it.
That's all you have to do.
So please show up.
Take advantage of, , the particularly the workshops.
Those are your opportunity to ask a tutor in a
small group.
I know when there's 400 of you, putting your hand
up can be a little bit intimidating.
I get that that's absolutely normal.
, please do ask questions in these lectures.
But nevertheless, there are those workshops.
So take advantage of all of that.
And, , and, and and be consistent in your attendance
and your on your work.
, this is a 20 credit module you're doing probably
doing 60 credits this semester.
It's a full time degree.
So 10 to 12 hours of work per week on
this module.
Right.
Two hours of lectures, an hour and a half of
workshops.
That leaves you plenty of time to do the reading,
the assessed quizzes and the hand in tasks.
Right.
That's that's basically what I expect.
Okay.
Assessment.
, I know many of you will have done Introduction
to Linear Algebra last semester will be familiar with the
online quizzes.
says.
Those of you who are not from a mass degree
and haven't used the online quizzes.
There is a practice quiz and full instructions which you
can look at, and we ask you to do a
little revision quiz, right?
So just before lunch, 100 and something, people had done
the revision quiz.
There were 98 people had finished it.
And if we look at the results, , now.
, the purple bar is the grade out of, out
of percentage.
So the average mark for the first question was 70%,
80%.
Question 637%.
Right now, what I'm asking you to are the second
thing to note about this is the orange bars, which
are called discrimination efficiency.
So this is a statistical measure of whether it's worth
our while asking you the question.
Right.
There's no point in asking questions that everyone gets right.
And there's no point asking questions that everyone gets wrong.
They're very inefficient.
Right.
Okay.
So we have a statistical measure of whether it's worthwhile
asking these questions.
So these questions we've battle tested these questions and they're
all very efficient.
And not all of you are getting them right.
For the first 100 people.
So what I'm asking you to do is to trust
us.
The questions might look trivial.
It might look something you've done before, but please
trust us and engage with the material that we ask
you to do and read the feedback and learn from
it.
Right.
So that's the deal.
Does that make sense?
Okay.
Right.
So that brings me on to the AI business.
What does it mean to do the question right.
That's the million dollar thing isn't it?
What does it mean to do the question?
Well, can I just ask how many of you can
solve a Rubik's Cube?
It's a group of mathematicians.
Come on.
Hands up.
Right.
And I would be very surprised if there was some.
I'd be very surprised.
From my quarter of a century of teaching, if there
wasn't somebody here who could do it in under two
minutes.
Right.
There must be somebody here can do it in under
two minutes.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I didn't want to write.
Well.
So here's here's the kind of weird question, right?
No disrespect.
I know how much work that takes, but why?
Why why would you do that?
We know the Rubik's cubes been solved already, so why
would you learn to do it that well?
Well, that is the question, isn't it?
Right?
We know the solutions to all these calculus problems exist,
but we're still asking you to do them for a
whole bunch of reasons.
Okay?
And when I is the the I is the latest
bit of technology.
But technology has been around for a very long time.
So here is an argument that happened about 400 years
ago.
It is a preposterous course of vulgar teachers to begin
with instruments and not with sciences.
And so instead of artists to make their scholars only
doers of tricks, as it were, jugglers to the despite
of our loss of precious time in betraying the willing
and industrious wits unto ignorance and idleness.
That the use of instruments is indeed excellent.
If a man be an artist but contemptible, being set
and opposed to art.
Okay, so I'm sorry for those of you I appreciate
not everyone.
English will not be everybody's first language.
This is 400 year old English and I appreciate the
language is gendered.
We wouldn't say that now, but nevertheless, people were arguing
about technology 400 years ago.
What were they?
What were they arguing about?
This is William Uhtred.
He's an absolutely fascinating character.
He wrote the algebra textbook that Isaac Newton used to
learn his algebra from, to bring it back to calculus
for a moment.
We know that because we've got Isaac Newton's annotated copy.
He's a very important and influential teacher, and he invented
one of the first practical calculators.
, bringing it back to Edinburgh for a moment.
The practical calculator was based on logarithms, which we will
be studying in this course.
And before we had electronic calculators and practical calculators.
People had these, which are tables of logarithms.
Write tables of logarithms.
So this is from the mid 1700s.
This book is , you know, 250 something years old.
And what it is, is it's tables of numbers.
Right.
So every single number in this book was calculated by
hand.
And then they picked up bits of movable type and
created the book by hand.
Right.
That's how this book was printed.
And I know it's wreckage.
I know you know it's falling apart.
That's because this book was actually used.
There's nothing more dismal and sad than a brand new
book, right?
So.
So what is the calculator that they're arguing about?
.
It's this.
This is the calculator they're arguing about.
This is a, , a 1961 version.
They were still using these in the 1960s.
If you look at the photographs of the NASA space
race.
, the engineers have all got these on their desk,
right?
They were using these for hundreds of years.
Now, this is this is a complicated one.
This is a much easier one to demonstrate to you
guys.
Can you.
, yeah.
Can you guys volunteer to come up?
Can you let these guys out for a second?
It's called a slide rule, right?
And it's based on logarithms.
So this is a C last, last century when I
started teaching.
, we did have computers, but we didn't have beam
projectors this.
Right.
So we had to have things you could see at
the back of the lecture theatre.
Thanks.
Right.
So how does this work?
Okay.
So, you know, when you add logarithms, you multiply numbers,
right?
So this distance along.
Thank you.
This is why I need you to hold it.
This distance along here is the logarithm of two.
Right.
And this distance along here is the logarithm of three.
And when you multiply two by three you get six.
And when you multiply four by two, you get eight.
And when you multiply five by two, you get ten.
And when you multiply six by two, you can't do
it.
So we have to come back this way.
And six by two is 12 two 7 to 14
1618.
Right.
Okay.
Let's do three times table shall we.
Okay.
So that's the logarithm of three, three, three and nine.
Blah blah blah.
Right.
That's how you know, when you add logarithms you multiply
the number, don't you?
Okay.
So this calculator and I've got my father.
So he was an engineer.
He used this as an engineer last century.
, you would have had a whole course as an
engineer last century.
And how to use this?
I could rattle on about this for a whole hour,
taking up my colleague's valuable time.
And your valuable time?
.
The circuit.
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
The circular one is good because it doesn't run out.
Yeah, you just go.
You just go round and round and round and round
and round.
Anyway, there it is.
So people have been arguing about whether we should give
you these instruments.
It is a vulgar.
It is a preposterous course of vulgar teachers, to start
with a calculator and not make you learn the principles.
That's what he's saying.
We're still having that argument now, but as far as
this course is concerned, we want you to learn the
foundations.
We want you to learn the details.
We want you to learn to solve the Rubik's Cube.
And we want you to do it well.
Right.
So why am I not worried about AI?
Well, you have to understand the stuff to be able
to interpret it.
There is a pleasure derived in doing something for yourself,
even if it's classical.
People still run 23 something miles even though they're not
trying to deliver a message anymore.
Right.
We don't run a marathon to deliver a message, do
we?
We run a marathon because there's satisfaction in doing it.
And you will get some recognition from your community for
being able to do that.
It's impressive.
And you all get that.
And whatever happens with AI.
Humans make value judgements, right?
Humans make value judgements.
And we're interested in aesthetics and beauty.
So let me give you one example of what do
I mean by aesthetics and value judgements.
If I ask you to factorise 61917364224.
Yeah, you know, you might eventually get to 144 to
the power of fifth, right?
And if you asked a calculator to take 144 to
the power of fifth, it would, you know, it would
calculate it the other way.
Agreed.
And you're all sitting there going, who cares?
I mean, so what?
Well, it turns out that 144 to the fifth is
also 27 to the fifth, 84 to the fifth, 110
to the fifth, and 133 to the fifth.
Which is at least moderately interesting, right?
I mean, maybe.
Or maybe sitting there thinking.
So what?
This is actually the subject of the world's shortest published
mathematical paper.
Counterexample to Euler's conjecture on the sums of powers.
A direct search on the CDC 6600 computer yielded this
observation as the smallest instance in which four fifth powers
sum to a fifth power.
This is a counterexample to a conjecture of Euler that
at least n nth powers are required to sum to
an nth power.
Suddenly it's very interesting, right?
I'd be delighted if I could find a counterexample to
a conjecture of Euler.
It's suddenly, you know, the whole mathematical world is interested.
And sure, they use technology to derive this result.
Of course they did.
They used a computer search, but they made some judgements
about the value of the thing that they were calculating,
and they recognised the significance of what they'd calculated it
when it came up, right?
So please make use of technology, but do so mindfully.
And don't lose track of the fact that we expect
you to do some things yourself, right?
Does that make sense?
Okay.
Right.
So let's bring it back to calculus and I will
stop talking.
Here is, , we know you've all done some calculus
before.
That's one of the problems with this course, actually, because
you've all done a little bit of calculus.
So some of the stuff is going to look.
Oh, I've already done that.
So again, just trust us.
This is about constants of integration.
So is this true or false.
Yes.
Yeah I mean that's basically true okay.
Except obviously it's a red herring or I wouldn't be
stood here.
So why is there more to this than meets the
eye?
Well I'm going to talk about this function.
This is the arctangent function, which is almost certainly on
your formula sheet for your high school maths exam.
Right.
The integral of one over one plus x squared is
the inverse tangent the arctangent.
Tangent.
Yeah.
Okay.
So.
If I diff this is a super.
How many of you have seen WolframAlpha?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay, good.
This is a kind of desktop version of Wolfram Alpha.
So if I differentiate the arctangent, I get one over
one plus x squared.
Yeah.
So everyone agree with that.
So now I'm going to think about this function which
is the arctangent of three x plus one over three
minus x.
Agreed.
So how are we going to differentiate that.
Well we're going to have to do a chain rule
thing aren't we.
So the derivative of arctan of q of x would
be the derivative of q of x divided by q
squared plus one.
That's that's the that's the chain rule.
And now we want to differentiate this quotient.
So when we differentiate those things and put them together
we get this expression here.
And we've got horrible fractions within fractions.
So I'm just going to rationally simplify all that away.
And what do I get.
Oh I get back to one over one plus x
squared.
Right.
So what's going on with that.
The derivative of this is the same as the derivative
of the arctan function.
Now Descartes's principal contribution to all of mathematics was to
link algebra and geometry.
And in the 20th century we mostly concentrate on algebra
which then becomes calculus.
So we do a lot of stuff symbolically, but it's
really important not to lose track of those, , geometric
roots.
So let's sketch the arctan function.
Right.
And then let's sketch that function that I just had
arctan of three x plus one over three minus x.
You know we've got this division by zero here, haven't
we?
Which is always bad.
So it's not surprising that at x equals three something
happens.
And if we then just look at the tangents by
putting points on the function.
We can see that those tangents are always parallel even
if the functions are not exactly one constant.
Right?
Because of this discontinuity, school mathematics by and large doesn't
put in all the technical detail.
We're going to look at calculus again because sometimes this
technical detail really matters.
A function is more than just the rule.
It's the range and domain, which is exactly the subject
of the this week.
So although I know many of you will have seen
this before, please pay attention to it because we're going
to see it again in a bit more detail and
with a bit more rigour.
And examples this can be generalised, right?
We can move that discontinuity elsewhere and still have the
tangents parallel everywhere.
Okay.
Right.
I think that's quite enough for me.
, good luck with the course.
I will be back in a few weeks to take.
, we will be alternating weeks, and, , there will
be moments, no doubt, on this course when you would
to talk to people.
So if you have any practical problems with the course,
, you want to change your workshop group or you
want to change your lecture slot.
Please stay in the lecture slot you're assigned.
Because if 800 people show up at this slot, it
won't be very comfortable.
So if you want any practical things, please email the
course Secretary Louise, if you want to talk about any
of the academic content, then I'm your first port of
call.
Okay.
Right.
So I will be in every workshop slot tomorrow at
the start of the workshop slots.
We start workshops tomorrow.
Come prepared.
And if you've got questions that you need to talk
to me about, I will be available at the start
of the workshops tomorrow.
, does anybody have any questions for me now while
Paul is setting up?
Okay, well, good luck with the course, and I'm sure
I'll see some of you in due course.
Excellent.
Okay.
So.
OOP.
Wait.
Okay, give me one more minute to bring up our
questions for those who have been.
Who was in Isla, .
Last semester.
Excellent.
So this course is going to work more or less
in the same way.
We have we prepare.
Some questions that I would you to answer.
And then we will talk about the solutions.
At the start of each lecture I will have 3
or 4 main points.
But this is not really to teach.
It's not really a lecture.
It's just to point your attention on the things that
are important in the chapter that you should have read
for the week.
So if you just bear it with me for one
second, I will bring up the questions and well, okay.
So why is my question slowed?
I seem to not be able to talk to Chrome
today.
Today we are going to look at functions and graphs.
So as Chris said, these are all things you have
been looking at since you were probably 16.
But there are so many more things that we need
to be careful about when we do this at a
more advanced level.
So today is just really a refreshing, refreshing lecture to
see what we mean by a function and how.
What is the relationship between the algebraic version and the
graph version?
What is the domain and the codomain?
So , so let me see.
.
Oh, maybe that works.
Oh, I'm not sure.
.
Sorry, guys.
I just need to convince my Chrom that I'm not
a robot.
So I'm looking for bicycles in my, , in my
screen.
, man.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay, so what do we want to say about functions
and graphs today?
The only two things really, that I think are really
important in, in this kind of distribution about functional graphs
is to think about what is the definition of a
function.
Not everything is a function word.
See, something is to talk about the domain and a
range of functions.
So being able to calculate domain and range.
The reason why it is important to be able to
do that is that there are things that we will
be able to do only if the two functions that
we are talking about share, for example, at least in
part, they range.
And then we want to talk very quickly about y
intercept.
I don't know why.
Well we'll see whether we have time for that.
The thing I want to draw your attention to is
that all these things you see on the board, they
are all the same mathematical objects, right?
There are all different ways of thinking about functions.
We have the algebraic representation which is x plus one.
We have the graph.
We have the set of ordered pairs.
That is a way of thinking about function.
That tells me that this is the set of elements.
And in this set that is the point minus one
zero, the .01.
And we talk about ordered pairs, because of course it
is important to know which one is the first one.
The first one represent the x coordinate and the second
one represents the y coordinate.
It is very important that you learn how to go
from one representation to the other, not just for the
idea of functions, but a lot of the mathematical objects
that we will see in carp are represented by different
weights.
And it's then important to be able to go from
one to the other.
So because I know that this system doesn't this wow,
look at that.
Because I know that this system doesn't display picture particularly
well.
That's the text of the question.
And I know that a lot of you are already
responding.
Can you please carry on responding?
I have only 69.
Yeah.
I'll give you a minute.
I think it is a really good exercise to go
through these questions in class.
And I also think that there are more than 144
people in this room.
So.
Okay, so what do we think?
So I think we can kind of look at this
question quite quickly.
The great majority of people have voted for Falz.
This is not a function.
Why?
Sorry.
Exactly.
So we know that not everything is a function, right?
So in this case, for each of the x on
the x axis.
I have the correspondence of two wise.
We call this the vertical texts test sometimes, and it's
something that is useful to have.
So in my solution for this question I want to
say no, that is not a function.
So who is that object.
That's the circle right.
And that's the equation of the circle in that shape.
The the equation of the circle is not a function.
So if I want to write it in an explicit
way for the y, I would write it that way.
And I can observe that each one of that two
functions.
So these were equal to objects in plus or minus
something.
So each one of that is a function.
But together they are not because each one of that
represents one arc of the circle right.
So this is quite important we need to think about
when we look at objects.
Exactly.
But that these functions are not.
In this case, it was very easy.
We all know this is not a function, but it
will maybe be more complicated cases.
And then we really need to see what we need
to do.
Let's go next one.
So this is a function.
I want to know what is the domain of that
function.
And these are your four options.
You have them repeated there because sometimes it's not very
clear.
Okay I'll give you two minutes.
Yep.
Dude, we got all that.
Oh, no, I got it.
Oh, here we go.
Yeah.
Basically my entire course with you guys.
So.
Yeah.
It's not.
Just .
You know, it's all good.
There you go.
Excellent.
Okay.
Can we have a little bit?
A little more?
A few more votes in.
And then we'll.
We'll talk about this.
And by the way, I'm totally happy if you turn
to the person next to you and behind you and
talk about this, because this is part of the aim
of these lectures.
Okay.
So you're not going to hear loads from me.
Okay.
So I have two, 201 people voted out of 222
logged in.
Which tells me that about with less than half of
you are not logged in.
But that's all right.
This room holds 400 people.
So.
Okay.
So first of all, do we think that the majority
is right?
So I would say that the majority is right.
But why is the majority right.
What is the difference between the most voted and the
second most voted.
Somebody can.
Yep.
The second most quoted answered does not include minus two.
And we want to do we want minus two.
Minus two will give us an answer.
It will give us minus one plus the square root
of zero which is zero minus one plus.
Exactly, exactly.
So we need to think when we do conversations and
thoughts about domain, we need to look at the functions
that could give us some problems.
In this case, the square root can give us some
problems because we know that in real in real analysis
or in calculus, we don't really talk to complex numbers.
So we really want the whatever is under the square
roots to be positive.
However, as our colleague was reminding us, zero is a
perfectly good number to be a subject of a square
root.
So in my in the solution of my, , on
my question, I want to say yes.
What do I need to make sure?
I need to make sure that the item x plus
two under the square root is positive or zero, right?
And this means that this is what I'm looking for.
Be careful because this can vary.
So for example you need to you need to think
about that when you have a denominator.
So if I had one over x plus two then
obviously minus two would not be in the domain of
that function.
Because for a fraction that's not acceptable to have zero.
So once when you have you are required to look
at the At domain.
You really need to think about what are the elements
that are involved in expressing that function and think where
these elements may not be defined.
In this case, square root is not defined in negative
numbers, but it's perfectly okay on zero.
So I think that we are all kind of happy
with the domain.
It's something quite that we can we can think about.
But I want to bring your attention now on the
range.
What is the range of function?
Sorry.
Let me just scroll here.
Yeah.
That's the text.
So let's have maybe three minutes to solve this.
And then I will be asking, , what do we
think is the range of a function.
How do how do we find it?
Is this the range?
Well.
This is the main.
Yeah.
But, .
Gosh, I can't see from here.
Why?
Y y is just f equal to f of x
by convention.
Is that right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh.
Lots of words.
I think one of the definitions.
Yeah.
I think there is one.
I think it's eight I think.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Still a few boats coming in.
This is very exciting.
So before we, , we reveal the answer, there seems
to be quite a lot of consensus about it.
Is there anybody that wants to volunteer a definition of
range?
So for the domain, we say that the domain is
basically the subset where the function exists.
Right.
So we see in the four square roots we don't
want it negative and all this kind of stuff.
But what is the range.
Yep.
The set of all possible outputs.
Exactly.
So think about domain.
You're thinking about x axis Success and range.
You're thinking.
Thinking about y axis.
Okay, so you need to have, , rules.
Not rules, but restriction.
That's what I'm looking for on both axes.
So why do we think that's right.
And how do we calculate the range.
Let's have a look.
So when we think about calculating the range of a
function, we need to ask ourselves the question for what
value of x I can find that y such that
and this is the set of all the outputs.
So in my case I say okay.
The range of this function is contained between minus one
and infinity.
Why is that the case.
Because the domain we have seen what it is.
The square root can be the smallest number of that
square root is zero.
So the range will have to be Between minus one
and infinity.
But we cannot just stop at that point.
We need to check that for each y in that
set.
There exists an X.
Okay.
So we need to check basically that if I take
y greater or equal than minus one, there is an
x such that f of x is equal to that.
And we do this in this case by squaring both
sides because we have a square root.
So obviously it's not pleasant to do calculation with square
roots.
So the yeah.
What is the purpose behind using a square bracket on
the left and a regular bracket on the right.
In minus one zero where.
Okay.
So that is notation minus the square bracket means that
the point minus one is part of that set.
Obviously infinity is not a number so it cannot be
part of the set.
So remember this notation.
Thank you very much for the question.
, talk.
So.
This notation means that both the real numbers A and
B are inside the set.
Okay.
So if I were two to write this, this would
be the number a.
This would be the number B.
My set is all the numbers between A and b
included a and b.
We have seen in the.
When we calculated the domain or the function that we
took the number two, and that has a square bracket
to the round bracket means that these points are not
included.
So if I had, say the function one x plus
two.
Yeah, the number minus two is not part of the
range of this.
So what is the range of this function.
From minus minus infinity to plus.
Not including two.
So I would write the range of this function in
this way.
Apology for my.
Okay.
So this is the union of the sets minus infinity
two I throw away the number two because that's not
good.
That makes my denominator of zero.
And then two.
And this is a standard notation we use when we
when we write sets okay.
So the range of this function is the first one
is a.
Let's have a look.
At the next quiz.
This.
Okay one one minute to do this.
What is the y intercept.
Oh, why is that still displaying that weight?
Oh, no, it's the red one.
It's the y intercept.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Got confused.
Thanks.
So how do I calculate y intercept?
What is the y intercept?
Somebody can volunteer me an answer.
No volunteers.
So what is the y intercept?
In general is the value of y when x is
equal to zero.
Right.
And we'll call it a y intercept because it's a
value that the function takes when x is equal to
zero.
So I think that at that point is quite easy.
One more notation confusion.
In this case this notation represents what.
In that case up on the board.
Sorry it's a point right.
I can I can Indicate points on the Cartesian plane
by ordered pairs.
This is the point.
So this is the point a.
Whilst this notation here.
Refers to a segment on the on the real line.
And this is why we really need to be precise
when we write mathematics, because occasionally we may get confused.
When we have points, we usually call them a capital
letters a equal minus one zero.
And what we have segments usually we call them.
We give them small letters names.
And this is why it's important to be precise.
So when you do your homework or you write your
mathematics or you write your assignment, don't forget to name
your mathematical objects, okay?
So you give them names.
Letters?
Not necessarily names.
But in this case, this is how.
This is the y intercept.
I think we have just time to do one more.
Okay.
Now this is.
Okay.
This is when things come together.
Now let's give it three minutes, because then we need
to go.
You.
Know?
I was .
Okay.
Oh.
My God.
Okay, again, a lot of agreement on this.
Why did I say that?
These exercises of this type is where everything comes together.
Can I do the composition of any two functions?
So can I just take two random functions.
And I will be able to write the composite function.
Is that true or false?
I can't.
Why?
Exactly.
So what about if I'm trying to compose two functions
where one exists only where the other one doesn't?
Then you don't have an output.
So we can't just go in and do the composition
of function by kind of doing the mechanical thing, which
we will see in a minute.
We really need to think about where this function exists.
How do they behave to the shared range domain and
all this kind of stuff?
Hence the picture on the board.
So how do we go around doing exercises of this
sort.
And this is also a little bit of a difference
that Chris was talking about before right I guess.
Well, I guess when I was in school, in school
in the Middle Ages, we would just go in and
put the, you know, the number in and calculate.
And then we were all happy.
This is not what we're doing here.
Okay.
We need to think a little bit more.
So.
What do I do?
I want to say that the domain of both functions
is minus infinity to plus infinity.
Do we agree with that?
What are my function?
I can see them.
Yeah, sure, I think so.
No one is a polynomial.
The other one is a Standard mod function.
So that's all right.
So that is not troublesome.
I need to check what happened with range.
So if the domain name is infinity plus infinity the
range will be a subset of that domain.
And then we do the calculation from before we need
to find a g of x.
That gives me the right.
So we need to make sure what is that y
exists from that function.
So what is the range of the function.
And do the calculation I did before I need to
find an x such that y g of x is
equal to that.
And in this case I get that the range of
g is -17 over four infinity.
Can you see it?
In that case again -17 over four is taken.
Obviously infinity is not because it's not the number once
I've gone in and I checked the domain in the
range.
So the shared subset which is the range and the
shared subset which is the domain, then I can go
on into the calculation, which is the calculation we know
from school.
And in order to do this calculation we know this
is all pretty straightforward.
We just compose it to function and we find the
function in.
In the last in the last item.
So this is just this.
This is just an encouragement for you to think
a little bit more about the mathematics that you have
seen in school.
I'm sure you have seen all these things.
This is the calculation.
So when we when we will be asking you to
do exercises of the type, for example, of, of calculating
the composition of a function, it will not be enough
that you tell me or you put this instead of
the x and that's the results you get out.
So you really need to be precise and you really
need to be careful.
You know who are dysfunction?
What do we exist?
What is the range and what is the range of
the composite function?
In our case, that's what we got okay.
So I think it is one minute to correct one
minute or two.
I just wanted to say that before you disappear tomorrow
there are workshops.
Please come to the workshops.
I don't know what you are you are attached to,
but please come.
And also I will be putting these slides online this
evening.
Okay?
Come on.
Oh.
Hi.
Yeah, I have a question.
Sure.
They said if we use the round date bracket, we
do not include that.
Yeah.
So if we want to find the limitation of the
function.
What do you mean?
So the function.
I know just if we want to find, , if
the domain of the X is, , it should be,
but not.
How will you find, , this?
Well, we will do limits later on, but that limit,
for example, may not exist.
So we we we found, we found in the limit
to not break the rule.
, no, not generally, but it may.
It's very likely that it's the case that the limit.
Sorry.
Let me just switch this off.
That the limit doesn't exist at that point.
This is why you don't take.
